2024-02-21 21:14:43,Text-only,FINALLY ü•π,"Not sure if this is the right sub, but I just want to share what happened today at work. I finally tendered my resignation!!! I recently posted on this sub about how toxic our management has become, and how I couldn't wait to resign. Today, I finally did ü•π

On Monday, I got an email for my JO with one of the companies I applied to. It took two weeks for them to get back to me and I actually thought di na ako ma-cconsider for the role. I also had 2 interviews that day tapos after ng mga yon, nanghingi akong sign kasi ayoko na talaga sa current job ko. Then I received an email regarding my job offer minutes later. At first, na-overwhelm ako kasi na-realize ko na medyo alanganin pala yung pag-apply ko. Bonus na kasi ng April and since natagalan yung job offer, I thought, why not just wait it out until then. Pero ayun nga nag-email na sila nung Monday. Naisip ko rin na wag muna tanggapin kasi if di okay ang offer, then I'll keep looking pa. Sa sobrang stress ko kasi, simula November 2023, nag-update akong resume ko para by January, makapag-apply na ako. Nagda-dalawang isip pa nga ako last month pero every time na merong di okay na mangyari sa office, nag-aapply ako pag-uwi. Parang every time I come in to that office and start my day, answering calls (CSR ako), lagi akong nabibigyan ng hundred reasons to leave. Everyday kong na-rrealize na hindi talaga siya para sa akin and hindi ko na kayang tumagal pa. Ang baba rin kasi ng sahod so bakit pa ako mag-ssuffer. The universe heard me and ito na yung sign na hiningi ko, yung matagal ko ng hinihintay. Buti na lang talaga na okay na okay yung offer sa akin. Upgrade talaga siya sa current compensation ko. I still have a long way to go, pero ganon naman diba, you really have work your way up to get better things. 

It was bittersweet, if I'm being honest, kasi I'm very close with my teammates and other officemates. Napalapit na rin ako sa kanila and ang sad lang na di ko na sila makikita everyday once I leave. Meron din akong work bestie na kasabay ko nung trainee days ko. We went through a lot together and siya talaga ang pinaka-mamimiss ko. But I have to choose myself and I will always keep choosing myself. Promise ko sa sarili ko this year na i-pprioritize ko na yung needs ko, lalong lalo na if involved ang work. If hindi ko na talaga gusto yung ginagawa ko, or toxic na talaga, I have to do something about it. So I'm really proud of myself for finally resigning because it took a lot of courage. Swerte ko lang din kasi I was able to find a new job kahit na Feb pa lang. Mahirap maghanap ng trabaho lalo na for a career shifter like me. Di rin naman ako privileged enough to resign and saka lang maghahanap ng bago. Hopefully, yung lilipatan ko magiging okay siya. It's a completely different role so I'll have to start from 0 ulit. But I do have a really good feeling about this one. Really looking forward to this new beginning. 

Just really wanted to share this big win for me! Kapagod maging corpo slave no? Gusto ko na lang maging Disney princess for real hahahaha

 If you're looking for a sign to resign, baka ito na yon! Go mo na yan ü§™

2024-02-22 02:50:14,Text-only,SSS Sickness Benefit Late Filing Issue,"SSS Sickness Benefit

Hello, question lang po. May issue lng po kasi ako regarding ng late filing sa sss dahil matagal na process ng accounting namin.

Bale po ganito yung timeline ng nangyari:

Dec 23: requested to bed rest dahil high-risk pregnancy. Nasubmit ko on time lahat ng requirements at na-forward ko sa HR at accounting na din. Bali 1 month bed rest yung required ko Dec 23 to Jan 19

Jan 3: dyan pa nila na notify yung sss kahit ilang beses akong nag-follow up sa kanila at nag-remind regarding na within 5 days lang dapat ang notification para hindi ma tag as ‚Äúlate filing‚Äù

Jan 19: na reject ng medical evaluation kasi dapat magsubmit ng certified true copy na ultrasound, which is hindi mn lang nag confirm yung hr or accounting na needed yun kahit tinanong ko sila ng paulit-ulit if needed ba. So ayun since na-reject, agad ko namang sinubmit yung kulang na requirements at finorward ko sa kanila. Then sa time na din nito, inextend pa din ang bed rest ko Jan 20 to Feb 19. So sinend ko nalang din yung requirements for second SN filing para isang galawan nalang.

Jan 25: dyan pa nila na notify uli sila sa first SN ko at second SN.

Feb 12: nag notify yung SSS na approve na daw for advance payment yung first SN ko, pero hindi nagbigay ng advance payment yung employer ko. Then yung second SN naman, rejected dahil hindi pa na settle yung first. So agad kong ni-notify yung hr at accounting about it when ma-reimburse yung advance payment pero walang response sa kanilang end kahit ilang follow-up na ang nangyari.

Feb 21: naka receive ako ng email ng SSS na ipa-confirm ko daw yung advance payment na na-receive (30 days count; which is wala naman talaga ni piso) at nakita kong 8 days lng yung babayran for reimbursement sa employer ko instead na 30 days dahil nga daw late nag file. Nag inquire ako nito, then sabi ng accounting na dapat ko i confirm daw para ma-receive yung reimbursement. Pero ang ending yung 8 days lng ang maibibigay dahil nga late.

Nag-reklamo ako na unfair sa part ko na mag acknowledge na naka receive nga daw ako nga advance payment (which is **,*** then yung ibibigay lng pala nila is *,*** if nag approve ako). Hindi mn lang half sa supposedly na matatanggap ko.

Ano po ba ang pwede kong gawin neto? Pwede bang mag reklamo sa sss mismo? Anong mangyayari if hindi ko i-coconfirm. Kase base lng sa email ng accounting, hindi daw i-rerelease yung payment kung di daw ako mag confirm or approve. At ang hirap pa, damay yung second SN ko dahil dito.

2024-02-21 22:25:08,Text-only,Giving Reviews after leaving a Company? Do it! Really helps for those job seekers,"**INTRO muna:** Kung ganado ka naman magbasa at magsulat, sana huwag ka na rin tamarin sa pagbigay ng reviews or ratings sa mga previous company mo.

So, share ko lang... Alam ko na konti lang talaga gumagawa nito pero sana, dumami na kasi malaking tulong siya talaga. Kung gumagawa kayo ng LinkedIn, Jobstreet, Indeed, Glassdoor, or kung ano-ano or saan pang mga Job Hiring Site, try niyo na rin mag-effort na magbigay ng reviews, especially kung negative or bad reviews pa nga 'yan sa mga previous company niyo.

Ako kasi ginawa ko siya sa lahat ng mga previous company ko. Nilagay ko talaga yung salary ko roon, pros and cons. Napakarami sa cons talaga. Bawal company, sinabi ko talaga na yung cons and bad experiences ko. Sa good kasi, I don't know, kahit maganda yung company konti lang talaga nasabi ko kasi nga, parang yung mga magaganda na 'yon, bare minimum and common at basic naman na dapat sa isang company culture. Pero yung sa cons? Since, iba-iba work experiences ko, iba-iba rin nasabi ko. As in, elaborated. Masyado na kasi gasgas kung ang sasabihin ko lang *toxic management, delayed salary, no healthcard, powertripping colleagues, entitled tenured* halos lahat naman kasi may ganyan talaga. As in, sinabi ko talaga bad experiences ko sa mga department, ganito-ganyan, hindi maasahan yung department na 'to sa ganito kahit trabaho naman nila 'yon, mga ganyang bagay ba.

Nung panahong naghahanap ako ng work, as much as possible, chine-check ko talaga sa kung saan-saan makabasa lang talaga ako ng reviews sa company na binabalak ko apply-an that time.

Ako talaga, bilang ganti ko sa mga previous company ko, halos lahat may bad experiences ako, ang ginawa ko talaga sa halos lahat ng mga pwede ako magbigay ng reviews, nagbigay talaga ako. Kasi alam kong may nagbabasa talaga especially kung higher position. Pero sana kahit hindi higher, maglagay pa rin kayo.

Anonymous naman kasi tayo roon, walang makakaalam na tayo ang nagbigay ng bad feedback. Unless, masyadong obvious like kung paano ka mag-type, mag-english or nabanggit mo yung mga details na masyadong obvious na sarili mo tinutukoy mo.

Hi. Need suggestion/s and/or advice po regarding my past job. 

So I worked as a sales in this company pero nagresign na ako last year. Ang nature of business ng company ay fabrication. What happened is after ilang months na resigned na ko, kinocontact ako ng past clients ko na may problem sa projects in which I contacted the company I used to work for but they are not offering any solution sa clients regarding sa projects na yun. Ang mali ko dito is ako yung nakapirma sa documents, kaya ako yung liable, pero yung pera na downpayment ay nakuha ng company. Now they are denying my employment and their connection sa projects na yun even though aware yung clients na nakipag transact sila sa company na yun at hindi lang sa akin. I have proofs and all pero kasi ang ginawa ko nung times na yun, inuna kong tapusin ang projects kesa sa ireklamo sila since napaka passive nila and unfair, para ma clear ang name ko. 

Sa mga lawyers po dito marami din po sana akong tanong, wala na din po kasi akong pera para kumuha ng lawyer üì∑ halos 150k+ po nagastos ko para tapusin yung projects na yun. Sana po may makapag bigay ng advice since di ko na alam gagawin ko, sobrang nakaka depress ng ganito.

Bukod pa ang intubated at critical patients na hawak mo. Tapos unhealthy din ang shifting schedule. Etc etc) 

So ayun na nga, effectivity ng resignation ko is mid March. I told my supervisor na baka next week na ako mag last day of work kasi gusto ko gamitin ung earned vacation leave credits ko at holiday offset.

I told her na I still have 5-6 days of accumulated holiday offset since October and hindi ko daw pwede yun magamit before I resign. Sobrang unfair nito sa part ko kasi I worked my ass off during those holidays and di ko naman hiningi yun. She's reiterating na pag binigay niya saken yung holiday off na yun unfair daw sa mga bago na di niya binigyan ng holiday off. I told her na resigned na ako at ano yun thank you na lang?

Andami kong tawa. Di ko alam kung totoong compliment talaga yun or binago lang yung kwento dahil sa pagmamaldita ko. Sinabi lang ba na i was meant to be a compliment kasi nicall out ko yung chismisan nila or it was really a compliment and i was asshole? haha.

2024-02-13 07:25:42,Text-only,Effect of salary increase on COE prior to contract bond completion,"Sorry sa title, parang naging research paper HAHAHA


Hi to everyone! I'd like your opinions or insights on this. 

Let's say me and my colleagues are project-based employees in a known construction company. The thing is, we have a contract bond for two years in the company, with each of us having differing end dates (within a 6-month range).

Within these two years, may salary increase lang 'yung iba na about 5k (18 to 23) and 'yung iba 2k (23 to 25) within the first year. Those na 18k starting were fresh graduates or first job whereas 'yung mga 23k already had about 1 to 2 years exp prior to entering the company.

Our immediate superior mentioned before that our contracts were planned to be aligned to about 27k before our bond ends, and aabot lang ng 30k pagkapirma ng contract extension. This was the plan. Recently, our superior announced that only one appraisal per year was allowed (kahit siya naman yung nagdelay ng pag-asikaso ng papers namin for increase) and that the resolution with our CompBen HR was that wala na ang alignment for 27k and ""awaiting for signing"" na daw ang 30k at the end of our contract para sa extension papers.

Fellow colleagues also planned to leave the company mostly because of this reason (delay or miniscule amounts of increase due to our superior). Our job has a common 35k starting in other companies and hindi pa naman siya saturated so we assume that we are not being paid fairly compared to other companies. Even more disappointing is the fact that other teams in our department  already had their increase maxed out to 30k after their first year due to their respective team leads, which made us distrust our superior more.

So our question is, in the case na lumipat sila ng ibang company, will the COE be a critical document in salary negotiation? Due to the arrangement ng HR namin, it seems na parang gusto niya na ""wala kaming history na more than 25k sahod namin"" after our 2 year stint. Kung tatanungin, baka pagbasehan ang indicated salary namin sa COE for the offer and may be a basis for lowballing.

Will edit the post in case more info is needed. Please feel free to share more insights as well since we're not much aware of how HR and negotiation works (just like our current job na nauna work bago contract and JO haha).

Ventilus Castelus

Klepac - Liham 02

Sa araw-araw na buhay ko, tingin ko sa mga tao, parang mga normal na maskara lang. Iba-iba ang hitsura. May masaya, may malungkot, may dismayado, iba-iba. Kahit sa mga araw na nagtatrabaho ako, parang nawalan lang ako ng gana na makialam pa sa mga kung anuman ang nararamdaman ng mga yan. Opi√±on ko lang, ang boring. Siguro, mukang sarili ko lang ata ang matuturingan kong ‚Äúbest friend‚Äù sa panahon ngayon.

Minsan, nag-try na din akong makisama. Ayos at normal naman sa una, pero nang tumagal, mukang obvious na sakin ang mga dillema ng mga taong napapakisamahan ko, yung bang may alam na ‚Äúreal talk‚Äù for me, pero, nag-decide na lang na ‚Äúayawan‚Äù nalang ako, para sa so-called status quo na puno lang naman ng mga ka-bullshit-an nila. Introvert ako, kaya ko yon nalaman. Kahit implication at insinuation, nagagawa kong ma-anticipate, siguro, dahil sa long-time exposure ko sa betrayal tsaka sa disappointment ko, na naging real talk na sa mga mata ko. Aminado ako, nakaka-putang-ina lang talaga ang buhay on the time of this writing.

At times, kapag may mga ginagawa ako, sayang-sayang ako na somehow, independent akong magtrabaho. Kaso, may mga tao kasi na sadyang mga ‚Äútry-hard advocate‚Äù sa so-called family work culture na sa suspetsa ko, yung bang, psychologically, gumagamit ng mga altruistic and collective concepts na dapat, ‚Äúlahat tayo, pamilya dito‚Äù, ‚Äúdapat, makisama ka‚Äù, ‚Äúbarkada ang turingan dito‚Äù, mga iba pang bullshit na pang-crowd-controlling, na ginagawa nang propagandistic! Subconsciously, eto ang nalalaman ko, tsaka, di naman ibig sabihin na evident to, for the least, na base lang to sa real-life experience ko. Ang babaw lang isipin na, sa speculation ko, mukang isang tool ang family work culture, like, ano to, katulad sa Japanese work culture na dapat maging ‚Äútapat‚Äù sa trabaho, most of the time, bilang respeto sa mga katrabaho pati mga boss? What the fuck‚Äôs going on? Baka tatanggapin ko pa yun kung ang magiging sweldo ko, is kayang mai-reciprocate ang effort ko, yung to the point na, masa-satisfy ang daily essential ko sa minimalistic kong lifestyle. Anyways, ano ba ang halaga ng family work culture kung lahat ng mga empleyado at ako, nagtatrabaho, for self-interest, di ba? Ang irony kasi dito, is, karamihan, nagsasama-sama para makinabang sila sa reward ng mga effort nila, na dapat kung may mapapala at napapala sila, go lang, otherwise, out na. No hard feelings.

Sa ibang pangyayari ng buhay ko, kailangan ko tuloy na mag-isip kung ano bang klaseng mga tao ba ang sadyang mapagkakatiwalaan na pwede kong gawing kakampi sa long-term life progression ko, pero sa ngayon, mukang hindi ako confident na sabihin ko na di sila maaasahan, lalo na sa panahon ngayon na karamihan, may pangagailangan na, by hook, or by crook. It‚Äôs a ‚Äúdoggie-dog world‚Äù ba naman, walang dala-dalawa, na magbabanat ng buto, makaraos lang. Sakin, todo tuloy lang pa rin, kahit kumakapit sa kokote ko ang mala-putang-inang negativity na gusto kong maialis, pero, you know what? I decide to to keep these, not into detriment, but to my fortitude. Syempre, laging vibrated ang kokote ko sa frustration, talagang magpapakatatag na lang ako para matupad ko anuman ang gusto ko. Ang iba, baka mag-isip na, ‚Äúdapat, magpakukumbaba ako‚Äù, ‚Äúdapat, wag mangontra kung di naman kailangan‚Äù, ‚Äúdapat, wag maging solo‚Äù, pero sakin, relevant ba na maniwala ako? I don‚Äôt think so. Ano ba ang benefit ng mga ‚Äúslogan‚Äù na yan sakin kung ang isang nakakataas, yung lang ang makikinabang the most? Siguro, economically, mag-i-improve ang stability ng kumpanya, pero, sa laylayan, na anjan ako, konti lang, kung tutuusin.

2024-02-09 18:37:52,Text-only,Intrusive tracking software in company device,"Hi, my co-workers and I (working for an American company, WFH) discovered that there's an activity and location-tracking software installed in our company-issued laptop.

I won't mention the name of the software to protect our identity, but we did some research and learned that such software can take screenshots and photos of us (thru the laptop's main camera) without us knowing. This software can also track our location.

We were not informed at all about this software when our laptop was given to us and I was wondering if you think its a good idea to bring this up with HR and/or concerned agencies (we have a few in mind that can help us)? 

While we understand that we're using company-issued devices but still, such devices are being used in our private spaces (i.e. our homes). And knowing what the software can do --- especially yung part na it takes photos of us without us knowing, sobrang creepy talaga. A coworker also mentioned that she worked in another company before and she was informed  beforehand that there's an activity-tracking software in their company-issued laptop, so at least she's aware.

However, in our case, we weren't informed at all. Do you think may laban kami? Is it just reasonable to call out the management regarding this?

HR has advised me that the Feb 29, 2024 last date is because we follow the working week not calendar week. Anyone could give me more clarity regarding this?

----------------


Hi everyone. So a bit of a background, I have sent mg resignation notice last Jan 30, 2024 (tuesday) with a notice period of 4 weeks as per my contract, therefore my last day would be on Feb 27, 2024.


I have sent my notice via email to my immediate supervisor and I cc'd our Senior Ops Manager and Director. However our Senior Ops Manager only acknowledged my email on Thursday, Feb 1, 2024. Our SOM then setup a 1:1 to discuss the resignation the day after, Friday Feb 2. However it was moved to yesterday, Monday Feb 5. Then again moved to today, Feb 6.

Now, upon our 1:1, our SOM insists that my render period will only start WHEN they approved my resignation (which I know is not true), and would effectively move my effective final day.

Question 1. since I know that as per law, the minimum notice period should be 30 days, magtetake affect pa rin ba yung notice ko na 4 weeks (28 days) even though as per law minimum dapat ay 30?

Question 2. Anong pwede kong gawin sakaling ipilit nila yung ""kailangan iaccept yung resignation bago tumakbo yung 30 day"" especially since they delayed the acknowledgement and  1:1 to effectively start the render period?",9,19,0.91,Advice Needed ü§î,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/1akgs5f/resignation_acceptance/,1akgs5f

2024-02-06 18:24:48,Text-only,Waste of time onsite invitation to their office [interview process],"So I applied for this one well known optical/eye wear company since my first impression of them is that they seem ""progressive"" since their owners are millenials. Then, I was invited for an initial interview with HR , seems okay, then I was invited to have an interview with the Hiring Manager.. (this is where the red flags begin to appear), Hiring Manager wasn't able to interview me due to a ongoing meeting, but HR should have been able to inform me, I am okay to wait for 30 minutes if ever, am also okay to be rescheduled, but no! I WAITED FOR 2 HOURS before the HR said that the interview will be rescheduled. Wasted time is wasted money since i filed a half day to really invest my focus and time on this company. After a few weeks, I was rescheduled (finally!), so far the waiting time shortened from 2 hours to almost an hour only. I was underwhelmed by the questions of the hiring manager, I was expecting more in depth questions so I can showcase my experience. Thankfully I was invited to their office for a final interview. Here goes the waiting game again, 30-45minutes in the lobby, 1-2 hours waiting for someone to fetch me in their conference area, then I was interviewed again by someone in HR, after that, they were waiting for the Hiring Manager's update if there's anything else I should meet or do, so I waited and waited and lunch time came, there were no more interviews! üò™ then the HR said that I was free to stay but as of that moment, i respectfully declined their offer and requested if there's anything I need to do/meet before I go home. There was so much time wasted already, I was expecting something productive since I filed a leave again to attend this onsite shit. Fast forward to today (after a month and half) I was informed that I wasn't shortlisted ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π

I am really angry on how they don't respect one's time. I understand that people really need to invest time and money to attend onsite interview, but if your process if inefficient, better remove those onsite shit and postpone interviews if you have meetings. Anong sible ng calendar management. Sayang ang sahod at leave sainyo. I guess I dodged a bullet nadin, I saw some negative reviews in glassdoor specially for that department i wanted to apply to. 

Weird part: Hiring Manager asked me if I applied before, I said yes, (i really wanted to join their company), Hiring Manager asked for the name of the person that interviewed me, i said that i forgot, he told me that it's fine since that the person probably resigned, most of the people have resigned on that department and hiring manager just joined last year. Stalked their LinkedIn as well, and it showed that almost all of the people in their team were recently hired as well. Hmmm something's fishy ü§î

I work in a big chinese construction firm wherein we handle biddings. I am determined to know everything from processing documents to the structure of the company. While working on this company, I was really challenged to build the puzzle piece by piece because of lack of proper briefing. I was able to ask questions but the thing was, how can I ask certain questions if I don't know the gap. So much processes to the point that I always ask myself on what should I do first and that. So in the end, I'm so confused on what to do.

Aside from that, some people are not really accomodating to questions and sometimes regarded as ""makulit"" even if I just want specific clarification after a research so I became so anxious to ask questions. Also, we don't have domain for documented email communication and use an app for delegation of stuffs. I really do think that It is one of the factor.

So let's get to the bottom line. I don't know where to start. I just really want to cry and I really don't know how to apply to the next compnay without any hassle. Feeling so incompetent and I don't know where to go now since I don't have enough fund to rent a place . Feeling like a piece of crap. I don't know if someone will hire me on the next company. I'm good at other things it's just that it is really  hard to get a job nowadays that's why  I took this opportunity rightaway.

2024-02-04 20:39:57,Text-only,Villar companies have no contract,"Parang wala ako makita na reddit post about villar companies in general. Pero alam niyo ba na walang contracts ang mga employees under the Villar group?

This includes companies such as Vistamall, Stamall, AllDay/AllHome/AllShoppe,  Planet, StreamTech, MGS Construction, Camella, Bria, Lumina, Vistaland, Prime Asset Ventures, Kratos, SI Power, Primewater,  etc

Andami niyang companies! And sa lahat ng kakilala ko, lahat sila walang contract! (Actually di ko sure kung lahat ng nalista ko sa taas ay wala, pero more than half niyan sure ako)

Tbh nagulat ako nung nag-apply ako at natanggap naman ako agad. Nakakairita pa HR sa company ko diyan, kasi bigla bigla sila magpainterview at exam. Tipong today tatawag tapos gusto bukas agad interview na. At magugulat ka na lang pagfinal interview mo na wala palang contract contract. Lahat ng pag-uusapan niyo verbal lang, walang written shit. Sa part ko ok naman un kasi nilayasan ko sila agad nang walang pakundangan. 15 days nga lang nirender ko kasi tulong sa team ko, pero I would have left immediately kung di lang ako concerned sa kanila.

With regard sa exp sa management, ok naman ung iba, pero ung iba toxic din. Parang different cogs of a machine kayo pero ung ibang parts kasi sablay kaya di rin kayo makapagfunction nang maayos. HAHA. And ang pangit lang na hindi streamlined iyong mga pwedeng istreamline na processes kaya ang kalat ng documents nila and even their books. Haha. Funny lang na sa dami ng gusto nilang mangyari hindi man lang nila malaman ano kailangan nila para maging efficient. 

Siguro kaya rin mahal magbenta ng products mga Villar groups kahit hindi naman talaga at par ung quality sa cost ng pricing nila? Marami kasing sinusunog para sa wala, so para maoffset ay mahal ang products. Malaki ang percentage ng costing sa risk? 

Medyo mataas din turnover rate sa company namin, and I think sa ibang villar companies din based sa alam ko. Ung sakin kasi personal reason. Pero mas marami talagang opportunities na mas maganda kasi compared sa kanila. I guess marami lang nagiistay dahil convenient?

Pero go gawin niyong stepping stone yan if you really need work. Parang madali naman makapasok pero initial screening sa amin dati ay logic math english din talaga muna. Doon maraming naligwak. 

Anyway ayun basically nagulat lang ako wala pa atang nagpost regarding this. Ang concerning kaya na wala kayong contract? Tbf di naman sila nagteterminate bigla bigla, isa lang sa team ko naterminate pero deserve niya un. And nasusunod naman ung napag-usapan, based sa company ko and exp ko.

2024-02-05 12:05:37,Text-only,Work from other dept.,"Hi! I just need to have your opinion on this. I‚Äôm not even sure if this is the right sub to post this. So context is bigla akong cinall out ng colleague ko from other dept kung bakit trinansfer ko ung call rather than actioning it.

Si colleague ko is from Dept B while Im from Dept A. Our departments are under 1 umbrella which means that we work close together.

A year or two ago kasi, si Dept B need ng help from Dept A because they have a goal/target/project na ma collect ang info ng accounts/clients nila and that they had a deadline. So kami from Dept A, we helped the Dept B for that certain period of time kasi sobrang dami rin naman tlga ng accounts na yun. Pag nag callback ung tinawagan nila, we just have to get the information we needed. They were able to reach the goal naman sa deadline nila. Like what I mentioned earlier, it was around a year or two ago. The project is still ongoing pero hindi na siya ganun ka dami and urgent and we from Dept A hindi narin masyado nag hehelp to this specific process nila. 

Now, everytime na maka receive ako ng call for Dept B for this certain process, trinatransfer ko sa kanila kasi in the first place, this is not our process and not my job naman tlga. And tapos naman na din ung time na nagprovide kami ng help sa kanila.

I had 2 calls earlier returning the missed call from Dept B. So I transferred all of them to them. Then nag chat nalang ung colleague ko sa GC namin na if I could assist nalang sana yung ganung process, it would be a big help sa kanila. 

Wala naman problem kung mag hehelp ako pero kasi alam nyo yun, hindi naman yan part ng job ko. It‚Äôs an additional task saken (though konti lang nmn task ko). Siguro may hugot lang tlga ako dito kasi ive done a lot na sa dept namin and wala masyadong recognition and now if I continue helping the other dept, what benefit ang makukuha ko dito. Wala naman. 

I would like to seek some advice kung pano ko to i-raise sa mga managers and teams ko and ma relay ko sa kanila ng tama yung nararamdaman ko. Thanks.",0,1,0.33,Advice Needed ü§î,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/1aj7hwz/work_from_other_dept/,1aj7hwz

I'm a CSR and never climbed the corporate ladder since I don't have that much needs aside the bills and life insurance I am paying monthly. 

Recently I have been moved to another project and I have been working with this project just fine for a year now but my new bosses keeps finding new issues with my ""work ethics"" per say. Recently clashed with a co-worker due to a difficult problem and customer and I was threatened that I will be sent to HR. Which rubbed me the wrong way as I have never experienced in this company for 5 years and other companies that I have been with. I also have been under multiple bosses and projects before.

This new project makes me wanna rip my hair out since the client is difficult to work with and I there are always constant threats from my boss that "" do x and get fired. "" ""You don't wanna be the last guy I forced to leave this company"". And It's getting too toxic for me. 

However, I love the remote setup, never need to go to the office and I am properly compensated. I also have a great work-life balance because of the work from home setup.

Nakakainis lang na it really is time to go pero wala akong choice but to stay kasi wala akong malipatan na mas matino. Kung baga, this is the lesser evil choice kaya kailangan ko magtiis kahit ang ewan na ng situation. 

1. Underpaid. I am not paid my market value. Nalowball ako for the own desire na makapasok sa gaming industry. I‚Äôm not the only one.

3. People are convinced na the company is the standard for high salary base rates for artists ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî pero see #1 and #2

4. Pag nag resign ka, ‚Äúhindi ka na family‚Äù so wala na sila pake sayo afterwards.

6. Marami ring issues within the core people ng business ‚Äî‚Äî magaling lang mag sweep under the rug yung higher management sa issues at mabilis rin kasi mag convince sa mga tao na everything is fine and dandy kahit hindi.

Additional thoughts lang:

Kahit anong reach out mo talaga, mag-ignore talaga noh?

Kaya I keep tabs on those companies na NR when it comes to follow-up and even add glassdoor review sa recruitment process nila.

Nakakafrustrate talaga. Nawawalan na ako ng pag-asa dito magwork ng maayos. Sobrang daming pinapagawa na recordings/exam/interviews at kung anu-ano tapos mumultuhin ka lang. Ganito na ba kabastos ang recruitment sector?  I have other applications pero lowball naman based on conversation.

Nawawalan na ako ng pag-asa kahit anong effort mo, nababalewala. At kahit anong lawak ng experience mo, mas pipiliin pa rin nila yung pasok sa lower salary expectation.",6,3,1.0,Rant üò°,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/1agnhvx/the_ghost_in_recruiters/,1agnhvx

Basically, Siniraan nya ako ng reputation. Ang masama doon, may mga na recruit na sya na kaworkmate ko din.

Pinapalabas nya na bully ako and siya ang victim. When in reality, Siya itong bastos. Sa kitchen kami nag wowork kaya di na bago yung negative environment sa akin. Pero ngayon lang ako nagka workmate na ganito ka toxic.

2024-02-01 14:39:50,Text-only,Abusive Business Partner,"Not sure if this is the right sub pero let me just share this experience with my business partner, the reason I pulled out my investment as well.

I'm no biggie in business pero I run multiple (bigasan, food franchises, small carwash, village parking space and Airbnb in surf area up north), yung iba dyan I owned talaga, others are shared businesses. I still work as a fulltime in a digital agency kasi alipin pa rin tayo ng salapi and I've been in the office since 2015 din and okay naman sya.

Since kilala naman ako ng mga colleagues ko about my businesses, this young colleague and hinawakan ko rin sya before, approached me to asked about starting a small business, so I asked ano business and assess kung ano ba knowledge nya sa papasukin nya. He'll be partnered daw by his mom and girlfriend so I thought okay sya. The way he tells me his plans was good so I offered to give him free consultancy and coaching sa business. Then I told him may new business ako na nakuha (refreshment drinks) baka pwede makiplace in tapos hati na lang sa kita. It run smoothly ng mga 5 months na and my sales are good din. Although the main business is slowly progressing, pero ups naman sya. I decided to invest na rin sa negosyo nya, ako nagayos ng inventory system tapos ako naghanap ng mga direct suppliers na mas mura talaga and also pag may mga meeting ako, nagdadala ako ng products namin to offer as free taste or minsan binibenta ko sa clients haha.

Pero 1 thing I notice bakit mabagal ang sales nila before is papalit palit yung empleyado and laging nagsasara kasi wala raw tatao. I asked him about the employees kasi on paper parang well compensated naman, sa viber chats sobrang okay naman sila makipagusap pero sabi nya ang aarte daw kasi nila. So I offered my help and called my batchmate sa school na looking for work, sa carwash ko talaga sya ilalagay pero nakiusap ako na baka pwede dun muna sa sa store na isa, luckily parang 20 mins away lang sya sa location mas malapit sya actually than my carwash. So at first month okay din ang feedback ni batchmate pero hindi sa colleague ko but to his gf and mom. Marunong daw makisama and natuturuan, pero pag si colleague tinatanong ko sa kanya, sabi nya sa akin is he rarely shows up and always may bad mouth about them as employees. I asked my batchmate kung gusto nya lumipat na sa carwash, which he, without any hesitation said, yes.

Right there, alam ko na tama yung tingin ko, may issue si colleague running a business. He got mad at me when I told him ipupullout ko na yung batchmate ko, kasi tao ko naman talaga sya sa carwash, saying mahihirapan ulit sya humanap ng store manager na hindi maarte. I told him ako maghahire ng tao for his convenience. Nakakuha ako ng tao and sanay talaga sya magmanage ng store, pero sabi ko sa kanya ireport nya sakin ang nangyayari sa store. Weeks later she told me medyo di nga maganda yung palakad ng colleague ko, so I decided magsurprise visit, I asked our store manager to inform me pag papunta sya. After all I almost thought na ako na yung nagpapatakbo ng business namin, from the money I brought in, yung clients and bulk orders na pinasok ko as sales and more. Di nga lang ako makapunta sa pwesto regularly sa dami ng lakad ko here in Metro and province.

Last Saturday, I received a message from store manager, pupunta si colleague with his gf and mom. So pumunta rin ako. I arrived 30 mins later after them and dumaan ako sa likod na door para hindi nila kita. Kakapasok ko pa lang ng gate, I heard my colleague voice saying ""*umalis ka sa harap ko, wala kang kwenta!*"" So di muna ako pumasok since rinig ko from the near window mga convo nila. Then I heard him again talking to that employee na ""*Umuwi ka, ang bobo bobo mo, yan na lang trabaho mo e*."" That employee ran to open the door where I was standing outside, pagbukas nya nagulat sya na andun ako. I saw her eyes na teary na so sumenyas ako na wag magingay and wait nya ko kasi papasok ako ng store.

Upon entering, I heard him shouting to his gf na nasa storefront ""*sabihin mo kay \*store manager, bilisan yung audit at baka maghanap si \*ako ng report, atat pa naman lagi yun.*"" like ang usapan naman every Saturday afternoon magpasa siya ng report sa akin. Si Store manager on her break pero my colleague told her to do the task kahit nakabreak since pwede naman daw sya gawin ng nakaupo.

In my mind, the dude is very different compared pag nasa office sya. Okay sya makipagusap and very positive yung character nya. You can see his immaturity pero gets mo kasi bata pa but he's improving naman.

Since nasa loob na ko, nakatalikod sya sakin, I called his attention. He was surprised and asked if bakit di raw ako dumaan sa harap. I told him kanina pa ko dun and naririnig ko sya, and I heard everything he said about our employees to his badmouth against me. He asked me for a management's talk, usap daw kami pati gf nya. I accepted, pero I asked the employees to join the meeting para malaman bakit ganun ang nangyayari. I was shocked when I heard from our employees yung mga words na ""*mga di kasi kayo nagaral kaya wag kayo magfeeling expert.*"" ""*pang sari sari store lang diskarte nyo hindi pang corporate.*"" and ""*Nagmamagaling ka, wala ka namang kwenta*."" these words daw came to my colleagues mouth kapag nagagalit sya.

So kaya pala nagaalisan mga tao namin, kahit ako aalis pag ganyan. I let our employees out na pero I requested to close the store and go home para they can cool down a bit. I talk to my colleague and his partner that I cannot run business with them kung ganyan sya, right there I said, magpupullout ako ng investments and assets ko. Si colleague nagalit, I can pullout daw pero yung drinks ko lang not the money I invested, akala siguro di ko binabasa yung books, sabi ko we gain since I invested so I will take my money and pati ibang gamit dun na galing sa akin. Yung profit, kanya na kung ayaw nya ibigay.

Last Monday, I pulled out yung mga investments ko sa kanila, I talk to my colleagues mom and gf, mas madali kausap yun e, they helped me withdraw my invested money sa bank, did the paperwork tas pina notary namin. The store is close since then, wala nang pumasok na employees namin. Si colleague, di sya nagpakita that time, absent din sa office, until now. Our CEO knows naman kasi sinumbong pa pala ako nun, pero sabi nya, labas sya sa transactions namin kasi di sya part ng business nya, he spoke to me naman, I told my boss na I can work with him professionally sa company but not as business partner.

Earlier I received a separate viber group from our 3 employees, di na raw sila papasok, I asked them if nabayaran ba sila nung last pay, ayaw nila na kunin. I told them ako na magbabayad, ayaw sana nila pero sabi ko pinasok naman nila yun so babayaran ko, right nila yun e. I also told them na I will help them find new jobs na fit sa kanila. Luckily si Store Manager nailakad ko na sa client ko before pa, she will start ata by feb 15. Yung 2 naman, I refer them to my client's na (convenience store company and logistics/courier company). I also send them a sack of rice each and some groceries.

Nakakahiya talaga yung experience and I learned a lot from this. I will always grateful to those employees who worked for me kaya as much as possible I'll give them extended help. At the very least nakalabas kami lahat sa toxic environment na yun.

The training was fun since i really enjoyed the people i trained with. A month later i got deployed into one of their restaurant branches, i was a BIT shocked since i applied for a barista position and was deployed as a dining staff right after training. The interviewer once told me that I might have a chance on becoming a dining staff and asked that if it's okay with me, i gladly said yes since i thought it would looked good for my cv lol.

2024-02-01 07:02:09,Text-only,"so my ex-ad agency is so disgusting, especially the executive director","EDIT: a lot of people are messaging me to drop the name, para maiwasan. i'll just use emojis. you will get it if you've been looking at creative job openings at jobstreet.

üõ∏üêë

background: this ad agency located in mother ignacia, QC is so notorious employees couldn't keep up. they would only employ 10-11 people supporting a lot of clients (they're too many i lost count). 6 out of 10 employees decided to leave because:
1. they dump a shit ton of workload on us without giving us a chance to negotiate, kasi we need to keep our ""partners"" happy
2. managers would file insane incident reports on us for not complying to the deadline. 6/10 employees had PIPs at one point because of it.
3. a lot of ICs work beyond working hours without pay (8am-5pm schedule), because according to our contract, OT pay is invalid in a WFH set up. so during covid no one had any OT pays. there was no consideration even when some of my colleagues timed out at 5am, which was seen by all employees.
4. a manager was shocked that his overworked IC was denied regularization because apparently this executive director bitch decided to weigh in evals from other managers without informing him
5. we are not paid properly even though we were promoted. we had one colleague who was promoted from junior to senior IC with only an appraisal of 1-3k
6. in our quarterly evals, we have this ""team engagement"" shit criterion that bear a significant amount of weight. this is based on our engagement during ""fun meetings"" where we only play jackbox despite our workload. they'll give us low scores here kapag hindi kami favorite
7. no consideration to their employees especially if they're trying to reach a deadline. we had this colleague who was sick and had to take a week-long leave. when he came back, ED almost filed an incident report for loss of profit because they had to find a freelance resource to do his work
8. OA and feeling bagets si ED. she would yell in public, fake laugh, and make up stories to try to make us laugh. muntanga lang kala niya cute siya pag ganon siya
9. they have an offensive sense of humor at times. they're very fond of body shaming.
10. we had another colleague who caught covid and eventually recovered without any financial support from the company. when he came back, HR announced that SSS (i forgot the gov agency) can cover expenses for covid recovery. this colleague asked HR and the CEO in front of all of us if he's qualified to get one even though he has already recovered, to which they answered no and fucking laughed at his face saying ""kawawa ka naman""
11. ED would backstab a former employee who worked poorly during his time in the company, and would constantly make him the butt of the joke of every single thing that she thinks was funny. imagine being a fucking joke to a whole company

it's a lot but that's just the tip of the iceberg. 

no one came forward to DOLE, despite a lot of us talking about it. we feared that if we do so, it'll lessen the chance of finding a new job. heck, a lot of us badly needed work that time.

so fast forward, they recruited a lot of people to fill in the vacancies, most of them are fresh graduates or just got out of their first job. they've also fully RTO'd, and they've been posting stories on their company IG account whenever they have a fun thing going on.

ok so ito ang chika. ED's new directive for the company's social media is to show how ""happy"" they are as a ""family"" to spite those who left. a lot of former employees (including me) are still mutuals with that account, that's why she thought of doing it. napaka-immature talaga. she's 52 for god's sake. 

i don't care how they are doing right now in terms of fun, but i unfollowed them because i keep seeing the ED's face i just wanna throw up.

ito pa, she's keeps on making fun of some former employees like what she did to the former-former one. walang pakundangan kung magsalita. she really thinks she's so fucking funny. i may not be one of them but i feel so bad for them.

though to be fair, current employees do not like her at all. they feel the same way we did when we were still employed there (kaya nakasagap din ako ng chika). they're currently making plans and finding a new job before they could submit their resignation.

this ad agency's never gonna be better if they keep being like that. i'm not sure if other companies behave the same way, but if you want to gain loyalty and productivity from your employees, please, see your employees as humans. that's all we ask for.

tl;dr: ED is trying to make us former employees regret leaving the company by posting stories on their company IG of how ""happy"" they are as a ""family"". truth is the company is disgusting as fuck in terms of employee treatment, that's why a lot of us had to leave, as well as the current ones who replaced us.",31,18,0.98,Story üó£Ô∏è,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/1afvjgi/so_my_exad_agency_is_so_disgusting_especially_the/,1afvjgi

Example na lang. Limited bugdet or to no budget for activities para mas makagalaw kami ng maayos, no proper office set-up to conduct meetings, kumbaga intrinsic motivation na lang ang kukuhaan mo ng inspirasyon to do your work.

In the end, we did our part pero hindi naman kami uusad kung puro diskarte lang namin. There should be support from the management. Anyway, hindi na gumagana yung mga positive phrases nya sa amin kasi alam namin that's just part of the play para gumalaw and mag perform kami at best.

Yung mga companies (big or small) na kung makapag set ng policies ay akala mo sila na yung may-ari sa buhay ng employees nila; 6-days work week, split-offs, sudden schedule changes, etc. Idagdag na din yun pagpilit na ""we're family here"" culture.

Recently napagtaasan ko ng boses ang friend ko after niyang magkwento ng mga nangyayari sa office nila. I won't go into details, pero basically ang nangyayari is obvious exploitation.

Yung tipong sakto lang yung sahod mo at kunwari maganda benefits para mag stay ka don at hindi ka makakapag-resign dahil isang linggo lang na mabakante ka, wala kang kakainin.

Natanggap ako sa company last December. According sa interview and sa job offer na signed, may saturdays akong pasok kapag needed. Stated na ang schedule ko is M to F at magkakasaturday lang in case maging busy.

Pagpasok ko sa company, sinabi ng supervisor ko na regular schedule ko na daw is Monday to Saturday. May policy rin na kapag umabsent ako this week need ko pumasok sa saturday next week.

Ngayon, I want to resign na kasi dealbreaker sa akin ang weekends na may pasok. I agreed nung una kasi kapag kailangan lang naman daw may sat. 

Pwede ba akong mag immediate resignation considering na iba nasa job offer at wala rin naman ako pinirmahan contract na need ko magrender for 30 days? Wala rin po ako itturnover kasi di pa naman ako nakapag 1month.

2024-01-31 15:00:38,Text-only,Am I an ungrateful person or I am just a greedy envious employee? A post about salary which should I ask an increase or do I even deserve it?," Hello there I am quiet in a predicament here since I have been working for this company for almost 4 years now this coming march and I'm just wondering would it be fine if I would ask my boss directly to give me a raise? Note: This was first ever job so I don't really know what to do.

When I got hired back then for a specific position I performed well and pretty much became a top performing agent hence I actually got promoted eventually after a year of working in this position but my daily rate didn't change and still the same which was PHP 909.09.

I accepted the promotion even though my daily rate is still the same but was told that I would get an increase after passing the probation period hence I gladly accepted and worked diligently.

After months passed 6 months I finally got a a salary increase and my daily rate would now be PHP 1k I am a bit sad since I thought that it would be at least a bigger amount which I mean for minimum wage is already big even x2 so I told to myself that it is good enough and just be grateful which I really am.

Time passed new people got promoted for my position so I somewhat got promoted without announcement since I was now an assistant manager to our department which I am now the one who trains new trainers which I definitely did without any salary increase. As time passed by when the new trainers probation ended which only took them 2 months instead of said 6 our salary became the same I got an increase as well as them and the same amount as mine which was 1200php a big jump I am happy for myself and definitely don't mind them having same salary as me even though I have been working for the company far longer than they are but I guess I should just be thankful and not be devoured by envy or is it envy?

now time passed by almost two years having the same rate the company faced some issues hence the hiring process got halted then we had take up a lower position which going back to what we used to do hence our salary went back to the first rate that I had when I was just starting but still I stuck with the company and worked well at first but definitely felt bummed out that my salary got so little but nevertheless I got some commissions out of my hard work which made my salary bigger.

Months passed by which now is the current timeline I was able to get back into my position as an assistant manager with the same rate back then 1,200. My question would now be is that would it be fine for me to ask a raise to my boss I know its big but we only work on average 20 days per month or even 22 days max.

I am grateful for what I am receiving but I guess its a bit little considering we work from home and we don't have any incentives whether for internet or anything no government contributions with all this inflation going up I guess my salary would/should also go up I guess I don't really know what to do.

Am I an ungrateful person? or am I just a greedy one? or should it be fine to ask a raise despite on what's going on with the company or i don't really even know what I am currently ranting right now but I guess its just clearly that I am not contented with I am receiving. which makes me look like I am an ungrateful bastard or idrk.

Eh kaso pati payment terminals ako daw mag-apply. Tapos dapat daw included daw ako sa planning ng mga product shoots. Tapos may quota din daw dapat kami. Also, sales din ako sa mismong store nila, so ako din mag-assist ng clients. Ako din gagawa ng quotations, all without proper product training.

The value proposition is nice, pero for someone lowballed from 70k to 40k (at hinayaan ko na nga kasi once a month on site lang naman), I think managing 10 shitty clients per day and being the only one doing client facing (via call) in behalf of the work of the specialists is just...unreasonable.

Sa mga walang alam katulad ko noon, akala ko talaga ang **LinkedIn** ay para lang siyang **Jobstreet**, **Indeed** (by the way, dito ako nakahanap ng work), or **Glassdoor** na hanapan lang talaga ng work. Pero hindi pala. Social Site pala talaga siya na intended for professionals.

Sa'kin kasi inayos ko talaga **LinkedIn** Profile ko kahit hindi ko nagagamit sa Current work ko. Nilagyan ko talaga na custom Cover Photo, Profile Pic na pang-Facebook ang datingan, ayoko nga mag-picture ng Grad Pic du'n. Pinoy lang naman gumagawa nu'n. Sa ibang bansa naman, parang profile pic na rin sa typical na social media, tapos Description/About Me ko talaga ang haba. Yung Work Experiences ko, nilagay ko talaga pati tasks na ginagawa ko pati naglagay ako iilang pictures. Para hindi lang imbento at totoo talaga. Pati Projects nilalagay ko. Tapos nagpo-post ako once a month. Tapos halos twice a day ko binubuksan, umaga at gabi para lang i-open mga Notifications na hindi ko naman binabasa.

Ang International kasi masyadong yung approach ng **LinkedIn**. Hindi makamasa. Kahit yung **Philippine HR Group** du'n, mas active mga taga-ibang bansa. Kumbaga sa Pinas, parang **HR** lang yata talaga active du'n para mag-post ng **Job Hiring.**

Useful naman siya sa totoo lang. Kaya nga lang may bayad para manood ng mga webinar, or video tutorial or video lesson, may pa-premium pa.

Kaya curious ako sa mga LinkedIn Profile ninyo, active ba kayo roon? Like nagagamit niyo ba siya sa day-to-day work ninyo? Nagpo-post din ba kayo? May ka-interact din ba kayo parang News Feed niyo or puro re-post lang kayo? May laman ba siya kung may achievements ba kayo sa school or work? Updated ba LinkedIn ninyo?

May company ba rito na yung LinkedIn Account nila big deal? Like ayon talaga gamit nilang social for work, communication with colleagues, hindi mga messaging app katulad ng WhatsApp, Viber, Skype or Telegram. Tipong every work related, ginagamit talaga yung LinkedIn nila or depende lang talaga sa Department ng Work 'to?

2024-01-29 17:59:48,Text-only,"PM Colleague issue: If you were in my position, what would you do?","In our company, I am currently handling two clients (consisting of six projects) while my 1st boss is only responsible for one client (consisting of three to four projects). Technically, I am under his supervision, but we hold the same position in the company due to regionalization.

Recently, I encountered a problem with manpower, so I decided to outsource some additional manpower. However, as per our PD, we need to maximize the overall manpower in our department, which requires us to undergo reorganization. Three clients will now be merged, and the workload will be divided among the areas that my colleague and I are currently handling.

To my surprise, my 1st boss had a meeting with my supervisor, who is in charge of the clients I handle, and they discussed a reorganization plan without informing me.

To summarize:
My boss bypassed me and decided to handle the three clients alone without communicating with me.
She was offered a national position but declined it, suggesting that I should be transferred instead. The other boss agreed to this plan, but our higher-level bosses are unaware of it.
If they insist on transferring me, I prefer to resign. However, I have a cash bond worth around 150K because of training, which would require me to stay for another three years.",1,1,1.0,Advice Needed ü§î,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/1adrsv8/pm_colleague_issue_if_you_were_in_my_position/,1adrsv8

Nov 7, 2023: filed resignation - requested to the management to waive the 60 days notice in my contract to just 30 days notice but got rejected. negotiations took a lot of days but still ended up getting rejected.

Nov 24, 2023 - I informed my superior and team that Nov 30 will be my last day since the management did not accept the waiver of my notice period

Nov 30, 2023 - last day of work. surrendered all company assets and sent the transition plan to my superior

Dec 11, 2023 - received Return-to-work order and it was mentioned that if i did not report to work within 5 days, i will get dismissed.

Jan 8, 2024 - received notice of termination dated january 2.¬†

i informed them that i was already dismissed since dec 16 (5days after i received the RTW order) and remind them the 30days allowable time to give my backpay.

they said that i have to get my clearance signed first before they will release the backpay within¬†30days.

Jan 11, 2024 - i authorized someone in the company to route my clearance. Clearance is now on-going

2024-01-27 16:34:24,Text-only,"Great place to work ""Daw""","Hello po sa lahat i just need to get this of my chest to move foward. 

So i was working for this company na part of ""Great place to work in the Philippines"". Well as for my experience with company and the management, they doesn't deserve to be part of this great place to work kinesu. Why? Sobra yung bad experience ko sa company nato. Let me start the whole story.

Before being part of this company, i was working for a small bpo company along mandaluyong. Well the great thing about this small bpo na napasukan ko before is kahit maliit yung compensation package nila unlike other companies around it maka tao naman yung management at mga boss at yung politics nila dito. The only reason na i have to give up my career with them kasi hindi kakayanin at kulang na kulang pa ang sinasahod ko for my cost of living sa mandaluyong at sa binibigay ko sa family ko sa province (somewhere in south). Btw technical account yung hawak ko sa BPO nato. At dahil sa kulang na kulang at madalas ay short pa kasi maliit ang sahod na realize ko na ang hirap pala sa manila. Ang mahal ng cost of living ko vs sa sinasahod ko (take note hindi po ako condo living or what ha? Pero ang mahal padin ng expenses ko) nag decide ako na mag hanap nalang ng mas malapit na trabaho at makaka pag uwian ako samin para tipid na kesa ibabayad ko sa rental ko na 6k sa mandaluyong excluded pajan sa 6k rent yung bills ko electricity, water at internet.

So eto na nga, na kita ko sa FB na nag post sila ng open house and they're hiring for technical support with good compensation package (2x ng sinasahod ko sa bpo sa mandaluyong yung offer). Sobrang saya ko that time kasi dininig ng nasa itaas yung hiling ko na makahanap ng trabaho na malapit, may magandang pasahod at higit sa lahat eh pasok sa experience ko as a technical support. 

Eto na nga. Na hire nako sa company nato at nakapag resign ako ng ayos with the previous company. Dito na nag simula ang bad experience ko. First bad experience, nakalagay sa job posting ay ""technical support"" only to find out na hindi pala tech account to sales account pala at hard selling pa (pushy sale sobra). Hindi important kung maresolved mo ang concern ng cx mo mas importante kung mabebentahan mo ng ina-upsell mong products and services. I have nothing against this kind of things pero sana naging honest nalang sila sa job posting nila at nilagay nalang na ""Sales account for tech program"" hindi yung may pa ""technical account"" pa kayo eh wala naman kayong pake kung maresolve ba or hindi as long as mabentahan yung cx. Tapos kapag mahina ka bumenta automatic terminated ka. Naalala kopa nung unang pasok namin sa production para mag call sabi samin ng mga tenured agents ""Welcome to hell"" (ay talagang hell naman eh pag wala kang benta ippressure ka mag benta at talagang pahiya ka sa buong team)  Yung KPI nila yung sales ang largest chunk so pag di mo napasa yun wala goodbye trabaho ka talaga kahit anong galing mo mag calls or what kasi hindi naman yun need nila. Ang need nila e yung magaling bumenta kahit walang kwenta sa quality ng call at kahit hindi mo matulungan si cx pasok ka sa banga. Ako at yung mga kakilala ko na kasabay ko nakikita palang namin yung entrance nung office nasusuka na kami at uwing uwi na kasi alam naming impyerno na talaga don sa hirap.

Second, sakitin talaga akong tao at kahit sa previous company ko alam nilang sakitin ako at super thankful ako sa previous company kasi naiintindihan nila ako sa part nayon. Dito mga bes sa new company hindi. Kese hodang mamatay ka wala silang pake. Hindi valid mag kasakit dito. Grabe yung naging experience ko dito, imagine tinatrangkaso ako to the point na nag cchills na katawan ko tapos nag paalam lang ako sa TL ko na sana makapag request kahit 1 hr rest mula sa clinic wala naman akong balak mag pa sent home. kahit konting pahinga lang kasi hindi ko na talaga kaya. Yung 1 hr lunch ko itinulog ko na nga lang at ipinahinga pero talagang hindi kaya. Aba si accla sabi ba naman ""ano mas importante? Yang 1hr rest mo oh yang magiging lost hour mo na impacting not only for you but for the whole team"" aba teh? Ano bako? Robot hindi pwede mag pahinga? Hindi pwedeng mag kasakit? Eh kahit nga tinatrangkaso nako malala pinasukan ko padin siya tapos 1hr rest lang hindi pako mapagbigyan? At dahil sa kinukunsensya ako ng TL ko about it tiniis ko not until one time na hindi ko na talaga kinaya, tandang tanda ko yun last shift ko na sana kahit ang lala padin ng trangkaso ko I'm willing to got to work kasi last shift na and I'm just looking forward sa restday ko. Naging severe lalo yung trangkaso ko. Hindi ko na maikilos ng ayos ang katawan ko in pain nako sa buong katawan ko at parang pakiramdam ko eh nababaldado nako so nag pa checkup agad ako only to find out na may malalang bagay pala sa katawan ko na nag ccause bakit ako tinatrangkaso at nag kaka ganon (i won't disclose wthe whole medical thingy) to the point na i need to undergo major surgery for it. Aba ang TL ko mukhang wapakels sa situation ko mas importante padin ang mawawalang benta at lost hours kesa sa life and death situation na I'm dealing with. Grabe nakaka iyak lang na imagine kung mas maaga ako nakapag pa checkup at nabigyan ng pag kakataon na mag pahinga edi sana naagapan pero dahil sa selfishness nila at ng whole management hindi ko natutukan yung health ko. Tapos ang ending iteterminate nila ako dahil unfit na ako sa trabaho due to my health conditions at sa procedure na inunder-gone ko. Ginusto ko ba to? Kung pwede nga lang i-distribute yun sakit pinamigay ko na sainyong mga lakup yung sakit ko ng kayo ang makaranas nitong hirap na to ewan ko nalang kung kayanin niyo. Grabe yung inabot ko sa company nato. Drain na drain nako emotionally at mentally sa pinag dadaanan ko sa personal life ko tapos ganon pa sa trabaho. 


Apaka dami ko pang bad experience dito sa company nato na hindi kona i-include. Hindi worth-it yung pinapasahod ng company nato sa binibigay nilang stress sayo. Hindi naman ako pasaway na trabahador. Nag ttrabaho naman ako ng ayos. Pero bakit need kong maranasan tong mga bagay nato. May pasabi sabi pa silang dito work-life balance at people's first kami. The whole management it self is teaching us to be compassionate and empathetic towards our customer pero kayo mismong nasa management and higher op hindi niyo magawa sa mga ahente niyo. Well bilog ang mundo what comes around goes around ika nga. Lahat ng ginawa nyong mali sa trabahador niyo babalik sayo at sana 10x ang balik and for the record HINDI nyo deserve mapasama sa the great place to work kasi HINDI naman kayo marunong trumato ng tama sa mga nag ttrabaho sainyo sa dami niyong kaso sa NLRC ng unjustified termination hindi ko alam pano pa kayo nakaka pasok sa criteria na ""best place to work"" kung ganon yung management and work environment niyo.

2024-01-27 10:29:57,Text-only,Perfectionist na Team Lead,"Pa-rant lang haha. So I have this officemate na naka-close ko na over the years and honestly mabait naman sya. Pulido sya sa work so everyone trusts her. 

Problem is, she's a perfectionist. Actually gets ko naman na its sometimes okay lalo na pag involve ang work, to make things efficient and effective. She doesn't micromanage naman, kaya lang mahilig sya makialam sa diskarte mo ng pagtatrabaho kahit same lang naman ng end result. Tapos lahat nalang napapansin nya, as in. 
Gusto nya lagi na gayahin namin kung paano sya magwork. Tbh, ginawa na namin yun, and hindi naman kami nagrereklamo about it sometimes. 

Kaso pansin ko parang gusto nya yata pati way of thinking nya sa lahat ng bagay i-pattern din namin sa kanya. Lagi nya sinasabi suggestion lang naman daw, pero madalas nya inuulit. A bit of background on her, lumaki kasi syang independent at lahat gusto nya outlined and organized up to the last bit. Minsan ok lang samin yun ugali nya na yun kasi nakakatulong din naman samin sa work lalo na kung meron nao-overlook. 

Its just that we only felt lang na para bang iniisiip nya na that the way she does things is kinda like a standard na dapat din namin ma-adapt. Dumiskarte man kami ng sarili namin, kahit pa iisa lang naman ang output, pag minsan di sya satisfied e papansinin parin nya. Even on the smallest thing na hindi naman actually nakakaapekto sa work namin eh pinapansin parin nya. 

Mabait sya, and she's nice naman. Mejo nao-off lang talaga kami sa tuwing gumaganyan sya to the point na minsan naiinis na rin ako.",2,7,0.62,Rant üò°,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/1ac03y8/perfectionist_na_team_lead/,1ac03y8

Hi, (29F) i am currently a marketing employee sa isang company who owns a well-known facial clinic chain pero dun ako sa isang business nila nagwowork. 

So eto na nga, yung head ng planta let‚Äôs call her Maria‚Ä¶ she‚Äôs been with the company ever since and parang right hand siya ni business owner. One time nag alok si Maria na pumunta kaming marketing team sa planta para makita daw namin process kung paano ginagawa product. So me and my team said yes and magseset daw siya ng date.

We‚Äôre waiting for Maria‚Äôs confirmation via text, email, or kahit call kaso wala kaming narecieve from her. Dumating yung time na nagka-tonsillitis ako ng malala and my doctor said na wag muna ako pumasok for 2 days so I messaged my manager informing her na ganito situation and they approved my leave. Suddenly Maria went to office nung day na naka-sick leave ako (day 1) para sunduin kami and pumunta sa sa planta.

During my sick leave (day 1), si manager lagi akong kinukulit about work na parang di ako nakaleave so i thought na pasok nalang ako kinabukasan even the doctor said na rest lang kasi nagwowork pa din ako. Tapos nagulat ako the next day, sinisigawan na ako ni Maria dahil hindi daw ako nagsabi sa kanya na wala ako nung day na susunduin niya ako. I was just quiet at the moment since I was taken aback from her reaction and masakit pa lalamunan ko. 

The next day, the president and his wife called me to his office. I knew na pagagalitan ako kasi sino ba kakampihan nila diba? Tapos they asked me questions like ‚Äúmay boyfriend ka ba? Pag nag aaway ba kayo ng boyfriend mo nagsosorry ka? Sa magulang mo ba nagsosorry ka?‚Äù Tapos biglang ‚Äúhija katoliko ka ba? may bukas na simbahan diyan malapit sa office, mangumpisal ka para gumaan pakiramdam mo‚Äù pero hindi pa nagtatapos diyan THEY EVEN GAVE ME PRAYER BOOKLETS PARA DAW MAGDASAL AKO!

Idc if pagalitan nila ako if about work yun, pero para sabihan na mangumpisal and bigyan ako prayer books?? Sobrang below the belt na, hindi na related sa trabaho. 

TL;DR: i was on sick leave when our head plant came to office para sunduin kami then she got mad cause i didn‚Äôt ‚Äúinformed‚Äù her tapos owners of the company said na mag confess ako and gave me prayer booklets",41,30,0.93,Rant üò°,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/1abaoa4/pinagkukumpisal_ako_ng_employer_ko/,1abaoa4

The problem: they ignoring my request to improve my skills, they bench me but because I work fast they tend to see my hours as undertime. I tried telling them I want to move to development team again so I can code but they refuse and want me to do the same all around task (coding, database, deployment, qa, customer support). Anything Jira throws me I will do it

More problem: the company is starting to be very political. The management is trying to downplay 10 completed task per day but only required me 3 hours to finish it. They want me to log 8 hours and stuff but they gonna say ‚Äúhow you justify this hours blah blah blah‚Äù. They don‚Äôt want me to improve my skills or undergo bootcamps while others are allowed due to their role (kissing ass to this one control freak manager)

Aim: to survive; I like the pay so how to go IDGAF mode? Does not reading email and waiting for my task is a good bet, and only replying when tagged is the best way to go? I am very active in my role because I was kinda in the support team at first, and I do help a lot of the newbies in their task when they feel lost, so it was not my nature to be this chill and benched, and always on the look to help colleagues.

Wala naman akong naging problema sa mga katrabaho ko kasi mababait at sobrang good vibes sila. Pero iba ang kwento pagdating sa boss namin. Sya actually ang may-ari ng kumpanya kaya sya yung may boses talaga sa lahat. Ang siste, pati sa pinakamaliit na detalye ng trabaho, pinapakialaman nya to the point na nalilihis na yung mga deliverables sa project. IT and Business Consulting nga pala ang nature ng work namin doon at nag-ooffer ng custom-fit na system sa mga companies. Ang kalakaran, pag hindi ka nag-OT, tamad ka at ayaw mong pagsilbihan si God. Wag daw masyadong magwork para sa pera kaya hindi sila nagbabayad ng OT simula nung pumutok ang covid hanggang ngayon na lahat na ng kumpanya ay nagsisimula nang makabawi. Hindi naman sila actually nahirapan lahit during covid kasi IT nga ang business. Pwedeng magwork kahit saan basta may internet. Ang naging downside lang, kailangan nasa google meet or zoom ka buong araw, minsan magdamag pa dahil kailangan magwork kasama ng boss. Kami na empleyado, need magstart magtrabaho ng umaga pero kailangan namin hintayin ang boss namin na gabi pa umaattend ng meetings. Ang masaklap, hindi pwedeng tumanggi sa extended working hours kasi nga, magagalit si God at kailangan daw namin magwork para sa kanya. Imagine yung ginagawa niyang gaslighting para lang abusuhin mga tao? Okay lang naman din na magtrabaho nang more than 8 hours pero hindi araw-araw. 6x a week. Ang masama pa, pinag-OT ka na na walang bayad, makakarinig ka pa ng mga mura at paninigaw galing sa kanya. If words can kill, siguro namurder na kami. Ganyan kalala. Kaya nga kahit na nasa kasagsagan ng pandemic, hindi na ako nagdalawang isip na magresign. Kesehodang mahirap maghanap ng trabaho. Okay lang. Basta makaalis lang sa kumpanya na walang pagpapahalaga sa mga tao at tanging pera lang ang iniisip. Sobrang supportive ko dati sa vision ng company kaso sobrang lala na ang ugali ng boss. Mas mabuti pa talagang iwanan sila. Plus, yung sales pitch nila, sobrang layo na sa katotohanan. Halos ‚Äúlokohin‚Äù na nila prospect clients nila kasi nagbebenta sila ng products na wala silang expertise. Kukuhanan lang nila ng idea ang clients instead na sila ang magturo. ‚ÄúConsultants‚Äù pa ang tingin nila sa mga sarili nila pero wala naman talaga silang alam. At sana, yung mga naiwan ay magkaroon din sila ng lakas ng loob na subukan ang buhay sa labas. Mas maraming opportunities at mas maraming companies na pwedeng magpahalaga sa kung anong kaya nating maioffer sa kanila.

I admit I've had several hiccups performing this role because...

I work for 2 different employers full-time simultaneously. (Shocking I know, but in this economy with zero support from anyone, it's necessary.) I've been at Job 1 since 2019, but because of the pandemic, I had to take on another one. Kept switching the second hustle around til I finally landed on Job 2 in 2022. Thought I could handle both just fine since the work's remote, but I think I'm teetering to the edge.

Because of aforementioned hiccups, I've been put on a month-long PIP at Job 2 right after I hit my first anniversary, and to be frank, I'm losing my mind over it. I feel like I'm performing even worse than ever because of the added monitoring. I'm struggling to keep my focus because I now feel like nothing I do is right. 

I can't admit to my manager that I dwell on my past mistakes, overthink everything, and think that every week that we have our 1-on-1, I feel my mind shutting down because I fear he'll point out a mistake that my overthinking brain missed. I can't tell anyone here that I two-time either because I need both incomes to support myself.

I can't give up my messed-up career now, but I doubt I can find any better because I didn't finish college (unrelated). So I'll have to stick with what I got. I know I'm good at what I do; I just can't keep up the professional sanity to continue this bit anymore.

I know that for now, I just need a good sit-down therapy session, so where can I find one here? Can anyone recommend a place or a therapist I can reach out to?

Thanks and sorry if this story took some odd turns.

P.S. IDK if this helps, but I've had no such performance issues with Job 1, only Job 2.

Translated as: ""Good morning maam/sir. Gusto ko lang ishare dito ang problema ko na walang sweldo sa Zanorte hospital (short for Zamboanga del Norte Medical Center). Nagtrabaho ako sa ZNMC for 1 year and 5 months pero nagresign ako noong December
2023. First 9 months sa trabaho, ok naman ang sahuran kahit delay ng 2-3 months, matitiis ko pa kase alam kong ganyan talaga ka delay ang sahuran ng Job Order sa govt. Pero after that, hanggang ngayon di ko pa natanggap ang April to November 2023 na sahod like
it's been 10 months na grabe naman jusko pati pasko at new year wala akong maibigay na panghanda sa pamilya ko. Mas kawawa pa yung iba na nagpatuloy pa sa trabaho nagtitiis na walang natanggap na sweldo. 0o kasalanan ko rin na nagtiwala ako sa gobyerno na mag-antay lang pero it's been 10 MONTHS asan na yung
mga pinangako niyo?? Natrigger ako nung nagfollow-up na ako sa capitol, pinapasa2x ako sa kung kani-kanino tapos sinabihan pa kami na hindi kami mabigyan ng April, May, June na sahod dahil wala kaming Job Order contract kase wala pang budget. Dagdag pa nila, hindi na
talaga kami mabigyan ng sahod kase close na ang 2023 at tapos na yearly obligation. Like WTF?? Kung hindi man kami mabigyan ng sahod ngayong Feb, magkita na lang tayo sa Tulfo. Sa mga mah ganitong sitwasyon, PM kayo sa akin because if we are not going to voice out, paikot
ikutin lang tayo at idadaan sa matamis na salita. Numero uno pa sa plataporma nila ang healthcare workers tapos ano na?? Blood and sweat ang binuhos namin
sa pagttrabaho namin sa ospital tapos depression and anxiety and sinukli nila. Hindi nla ba nakkita sitwasyon namin? I know ang iba ok lang matagal mabigyan ng sahod pero sa akin hindi kase ako ang bumubuhay sa aking pamilya. I know common practice po ang delay na
sahod pero 10 F**KING MONTHS ay di na po tama yon! If di nila mabigyan ang april, may, at june, harap na lang tayo sa Tulfo or sa Ombudsman. I hope ma post mo to
admin pakitago na lang ang name saka pic thank you very much.'


TLDR: isang healthcare worker ng Zamboanga del Norte medical center Job order under province of zamboanga del norte ang hindi nabigyan ng sahod ng sampung
buwan. Imagine 10 MONTHS NA WALANG SAHOD?? What kind of quackery did the government do?? Seriously nakakahiya yan sa office nila if ever totoo. I wonder bakit hindi ito nabalita sa national TV. Ganito na ba ang
pilipinas ngayon? I pray for kababayan for justice and his/her timely situation. As an OFW nurse, kaya nga ako umalis sa bansa dahil sa ganitong kalakaran ng sistema.I ddnt expect na 2024 na may ganito pa rin.

Nagwork ako sa isang company na to last 2017 to 2019ish. Maayos naman ang pakikitungo saken ng company na yun. In fact, binigyan nila ako ng choice para wag na lang mag resign instead long vaca na lang instead na paid pero di ako pumayag.

Muntikan na ako di makapasok dun sa company na un dahil dun sa not for rehire na sabi nila na un.

Anyways, it's been years and gusto ko lang sya ilabas. Ayaw ko na mag work ulit dun dahil sa nangyare kasi feeling ko sobrang petty nya na ewan.

2024-01-25 09:23:55,Text-only,client wants to hire me directly,"H! Need help.

I am currently under a VA agency which pays less than 20k per month pero less than 2k USD binabayad ng client (yes, ang lala). I was starting palang sa industry so I nigrab ko na for experience and sa skills and knowledge na maacquire ko.

During our daily meeting, tinanong niya ako if recorded daw ba yung meeting, sabi ko hindi. Then sabi niya he wants to hire me directly kasi magkakaroon daw siya ng business partner at ayun daw mas kaya magbayad sa akin, at di daw nila need ng 40 hours per week, kahit 10 lang. Ofcourse gusto ko. And dahil sa bugso ng damdamin, naopen ko nga yung about sa salary ko (hindi ko exact sinabi na 20k lang pero mali pa rin kasi it was stated sa contract na confidential) and told him na I am planning to leave the company. Sabi niya bakit daw ganoon yung agency, etc.

Kinabukasan, he asked for my personal email address para daw dun namin pagusapan. He seemed serious dun sa offer niya. I told him na binasa ko yung contract at may non-solicitation clause which bawal magwork sa client w/in 2 years of leaving the agency. I asked him kung may non-compete clause sa contract nila and he said yes. Then I told him na the offer is great (we haven't discussed about the salary if ever), and we can do it if we can both compromise and keep it  to which he agreed. Sabi niya pa marami daw siya kakilala na pwede niyang ioffer sa akin as client.

My questions are:
  1.  Should I go for it? If yes, siya ba gagawa nung contract or ako? Can I request for additional clause lalo na yung confidentiality? Kaso nabanggit niya to a business partner niya bago niya pa iopen sa akin yung offer.
  2.  Ano po dapat ko gawin para di mahuli? Mauna magresign bago matapos contract nila ni agency? Or magtanggap lang ng client na bigay ni agency and sideline lang si current client? Then tsaka ko na tatanggapib yung ioffer niyang ibang clients?
  3.  Is $5 per hour okay? Mali din kasi ako na sinabi kong 1/4 lang nakukuha ko sa payment niya sa agency so nakita ko na nicompute niya at baka dun niya pa ibase yung salary ko. Wala siyang sinabi na tatapatan niya or what. Tinanong niya lang ako but since I don't have any idea, wala akong sinabi.
  4.  May tracking system yung agency (activtrak). Kung gagawa ba ako ng tasks sa ibang user account but same device, matatrack pa rin?

As I observe myself I see no progress in my tasks because mostly encoding of sales invoices and other clerical tasks as well as nagfefacebook me and watch dramas because wla n rin gagawin.

the other side of this story is I already lose hope to be part of the hospitality industry n malayong malayo s tinapusan ko n management. but my prayers ended up calling me to have another interview but in a different department kinakbahan ako ksi I need to prepare cause maybe this is my last chance  ganito pala kahirap s real world lol. finding your purpose khit di mo alam ano b tlga gsto mo

Pinaabot ko to sa pinaka boss naming lahat, kahit sya nagulat sa nangyari at siya daw mag aasikaso to fix this, umiyak na rin ako sa kanya sa kadahilanang di ko ineexpect na mangyyare sakin ito.

Monday, nagkita kita ang lahat at pinatawag ako ng manager ko at magusap daw kami, ang statement niya saken ‚Äúbakit umabot sa pinakaboss namin at san daw nanggaling ang galit ko‚Äù, di ko maintindihan bakit muka pa akong masama? Hindi ko inaaccept mga reason niya dahil ginagaslight niya ako at nangangatwiran, humingi siya ng dispensa dahil napagalaman nga namin na hindi kami ito.

2024-01-25 03:07:01,Text-only,"Ako yung na agrabyado, pero ako yung nalagay sa PIP","Mag-oone year anniversary na pala to sa work ko and I don't know how I've made it this long.

Just this month I was put on PIP for not being ""culturally fit"" sa office namin, yung reason? Ginrey-rock ko yung ex HR representative namin.

Context lang about me, I'm one of the youngest members of the company and nasa at least 4 years yung gap naming with our older co-workers. Basically my co-workers are all in their early to mid 30s. Maliit lang company namin, but this isn't my first company but this is one of the first companies where I felt very comfortable with the work and environment.

We're very lean din sa company namin, for the PH team 9 lang kami lahat. 

It all started when I developed a friendship with one of the managers from a different department. Now we don't exactly work in the same department so wala talagang kinalaman ang work with how we became friends. It just turned out one day that she liked hanging out with me and we listen to a lot of similar music - we got even closer when I offered to help her get tickets to one concert she wanted to go do bad pero conflict siya with a work-trip. I had the connections and di naman ako madamot so I secured them for her and she was thankful. Ever since then, we'd get into conversations about concerts, music fests, travel, the like. Yan lang kasi escape ko from all the stresses of work, yan lang din reason why I work hard to be able to afford those.

Now comes the trouble, si close friend M ko sa office, is also best friends with the HR representative ng company. Siya yung nagpapasok and they go way back, even being co workers in a previous job once before our company now.

Before I would even feel like I'm intruding in their friendship when close friend would ask me to go with them both to buy office supplies, or run errands for the company during weekends. Again, I'm a homebody and going out sometimes would do my mental health good. Okay naman yung dynamic at first, kaso I just noticed na parang, close friend (36) gets treated badly by HR representative (33).

Me (25) minding my own business, kept that observation to myself kasi at the end of the day, wala naman akong say sa friendship nila. If time yung basehan, they're probably tighter than me and my close friend kasi they've been friends for longer, pero that doesn't really mean anything to me.

3 months into my employment sa company, I also found one of my close friends lets name her B needing work, and I'm the type to help out whenever I can. So I put in a good work, and thankfully si B napasok. Take note around this time okay pa kami. Super solid naming ng ex-best friend ko, she's 4 years older than me so I respect her the way I would my elders. Close friend M even encouraged me to put in the good word because she says she trusts me with whoever I vouch for especially since B will be working under her in case ma-hire siya. 

And B did get hired, she would work under close friend M, and I'd be drowning in work from my department while also training B while I offload some of my responsibilities to her at the request of the company to make me focus on other things.

Around this time din I found myself having to hold back on company gatherings (may weekly dinners kasi kami every wednesday) because my papa got diagnosed with cancer, and my mental health was very bad due to overworking myself.

One day though, pinagalitan ako ng boss ko, which is the co-founder, because may nagkamali with handling a client, and sadly it was B. Of course, best friend ko si B dun so I tried my best para i-cushion yung galit ng boss ko and para naman di siya mapagalitan. I made sure close friend M knew so she can also help me out as B is directly under her naman.

Both close friend M and I spent a good 4 hours solving the problem, and di man lang nag reply si B sa amin. 

Hours later (after the shift, so weekend na) nakita ko nalang si B na nagsusubtweet ng masasamang words (;\~:) pertaining to me about work and even saying I'm using my mental health as an excuse. 

Why she was attacking me? I don't know. I was too busy hours before that cleaning up her mess.

I told close friend M about it and she was just confused as I was where all this hostility was coming from, especially when close friend M and I have been cleaning up after friend B ever since she got into the company.

The kicker here is si friend B has always confided to me about having post partum, the reason why I wanted her to get into our company so bad because the pay was significantly higher than her old company, plus this would greatly help her pay off her bills. I rarely indulge her when she confides in me about her marital trouble because i'm honestly not a good fit to give her advice on that, I just make sure to let her know na people are not her enemy, her partner is not her enemy, and she should give them the chance.

Ang sad lang kasi she never gave me the chance and immediately assumed I was mad at her for having to pick up after friend B at work, when really I was just working on autopilot with all the heavy baggage I was already carrying on my own. Besides, post partum is a lot, I could go longer not letting her know about my dad's diagnosis, or my own head going to shit.

Pero turns out, friend B and HR representative has already been harboring ill-will towards me. A few more months after that incident, friend B has been making it harder for me to do my work. So one day I snapped, everything got to me.

And this got the attention of our management and our US team. 

I'm not one to complain pero I've had enough. We got a mediation meeting happen, umiyak si friend B in front of me accusing me of making her feel like she was indebted to me when all the time she was in the company, I've been focusing on my work and helping clean up whatever work she messed up just so our Co-founder wouldn't get mad at her even further. During that mediation though, it was clear that HR representative was very biased towards friend B in the process, and management even found more instances where HR representative was breaking company protoc

This lead to her and friend B being put under PIP and me let off with a warning for acting unbecoming of myself at work.

After that I simply grey rocked them both. 

I simply cut off my friendship with B, a 4 year friendship down the drain. We were so close that I even let her stay for weeks in my apartment when she and her family would fight. So close that I missed a day of work because I ran around town buying them groceries and medicine when I found out their house got cordoned after she got COVID during the pandemic. I couldn't handle the disrespect.

The worst thing about this all is si HR Representative pa ang galit sa akin? Why? We don't know. 

Feel ko mas nagagalit siya when I grey rock her. When I stay out of her way. Do whatever she says. Be the bigger person and just not give in to her taunts.

She's come to a point na even when friend B was already let go of the company, she would stoop so low as to rally all the new hires against me before even getting to know me.

Sobrang petty din niya, I got hospitalized for a week nung November for dengue, and lets be honest my mental health probably made it even worse, I barely get hospitalized. Our management was so worried and tasked her to send fruits my way, but when she found out that close friend M has been dropping by to see me after work, walang dumating. Kahit apple juice.

Now to the PIP part, aware naman yung management na ganun yung treatment nya sa akin. Just this December pinag WFH ako indefinitely to somehow protect me from the hostility of the situation, work no longer felt safe for me, and I'm p sure bumaba ang performance ko with the treatment I've been getting at work. Yung US team nalang talaga yung nagtetreat sakin as human, as well as close friend M,and yung country manager namin.

The higher ups think it's because HR rep is jealous of my friendship with close friend M, but i don't get that.

I'm not the one who forces close friend M to hang out with me, she just wants to and di naman ako tumatanggi if it means I get to go out of the house. We've even invited her out to join us before until she stopped coming on her own accord.

&#x200B;

I just feel like it's very unfair na I'm under PIP for basically being bullied at work. I never confront them because they're all older than me by significant years, ayoko di naman ng gulo.

&#x200B;

What's more unfair is ang dami ko pang opportunities sa company and HR representative is just paying off debt she owes to the company before resigning. I have so much to lose while she doesn't.

&#x200B;

2024-01-24 16:55:49,Text-only,My mom is giving me the silent treatment and sinabing kinamumuhian ko daw paghiram niya sakin ng pera.,"My mom is a businesswoman and my pops a seafarer. I (F21) used to work with a monthly salary less than 20k. While I was working, she would constantly ask to borrow money from me and may pa ""ibibigay ko sayo agad bukas/this week"" siya. I would willingly let her even when I know she won't stick to her words. My salary money was used for many things like my rent, school, meals, etc. I was trying to be independent so she can use my dad's allotment for my siblings. This went on for months and even prior to only having school allowance pa from my papa, she'd also borrow my money. I know some of her money problems. Loans everywhere and at least 2 demand letters I've seen. I was also publicly shamed by a former friend on fb kase may utang daw mama ko sa mama niya and I didn't know about this utang. Her loans? My dad is unaware.

So last week, she borrowed some of my allowance given by my pops and again, said she'd return it the next day. Ending is, she still hasn't. And earlier this day she talked me into asking for more allowance from my pops kase di pa daw nya ma-reimburse yung pera kong hiniram nya. I said ""no"". Context is, I'll be using that allowance this week na. Then, we had a conversation about salaries and she told me this: ""dapat lang magpahiram ka sakin ng pera mo kase pinapahiram kita pag ikaw yung walang pera"".  

Isn't it valid to feel disappointed, hurt, and annoyed at the same time? How would you reply to her if it were u in my shoes? 

I replied about how my then salary was barely enough and how she'd always call me days prior to borrowing my money shouldn't be her thing. I made it a point that she's expecting too much from me already, how much more if when I finally have the right career? She got mad and also said ""sge di na ako manghihiram sayo nang pera, kino-compare mo ko sa ibang nagtatrabaho na mga kapatid lang ginagastusan pero ikaw yung mama mo naman ang nanghihiram"". And then gave me the silent treatment. My mind just went blank for seconds. Has she not realized that she's also treating me like her ""arawan"" loans na pwede lang din kung bukas na yung collection (!??). 

The thing is she doesn't understand how this negatively affects me. I have bigger dreams like studying abroad. But I always get stuck din in between her problems. And shouldn't major money talk be for adults? I think pops finally needs to know of her problems. I DO want to give back to my parents when the time comes but now parang ayaw ko na. I'm thinking na it'd be better to lie to her about my money. I can no longer think of how to deal with her or even make her understand kase di naman siya nakikinig when I try to make a point. How do I set clear boundaries?

This all started when I got the regularly position, and had particularly special treatments from our boss. Automatically when I joined their office, I got privileges (I admit) and doing his dirty works. He invites me with almost all his whereabouts. As a newbie to their office I have no choice but to affirm kasi work-related naman - as of my perspective.

I NEVER ASKED EVEN A SINGLE ONE OF THOSE.

I've been working really hard since my first day of work as a contractual in other office connected to the boss I mentioned above. That, paved my way on getting my regularization.

Yet, because of how that boss treat me in the office, rumors began to swarm about us having a relationship. Gossips then reached to our boss' end and he provocatively announced during our meeting that all rumors are false and I am just competent worker the office needed most.

Here's the catch.

He became more and more stingy towards me. He even invited me personally going out, the first time he did this I was shocked that we were alone - I just let it slip out kasi wala talagang malice sa akin this is all just part of the work, I supposed.

I realized that everything was wrong when he asked me about my lovelife. Upon confirming my status as single, it must have became his affirmation of my availability to be his. Yuck. He  begun saying delusional things as if he is my boyfriend.

RIGHT THERE AND THEN, HE CONFESSED THAT HE LIKES ME AND WANTS US TO BE REAL ü§¢

That became a trauma. I cried for several hours, asked my friends for advices. I then decided to ask for help from my previous boss.

I cried my heart out in front of her and asked for help. She was furious of course and took the concern personally with my boss at that time. After days, I was transferred back to my previous office. 

I thought the storm was over, until two weeks ago. He demanded me to return to his office as his executive secretary. He said that he will publish an official order for this matter. My now-boss still defended me and made sure I will be in a safe working space. An Official Order was published last monday confirming that I'll still remain with my now-boss' team.

The plot didn't stopped there yet, mukhang may i-kikwento pa ako. I just need to resolve this first.

However, naging hesitant yung isang higher up dahil nalaman na I am diagnose with Bipolar I. Nalaman nila ito dahil sa pre-employment medical exam. Ang worry ng HR and owner is the working environment and how I will handle rejections. (tinawagan naman niya ako how I work and handle stress)

so as the other staff checks my documents, the other lady told the 3 to 4 guys na they are scheduled for an interview next week so i was expecting na yun din sasabihin sa akin after i-check ang documents ko pero natapos na ang lahat, walang sinabi ng date ng job interview ko. what gives me more ick ay may namention yung other lady na ""sabihan ko na lang si 'SIR' na nagpasa na kayo"" so grabe napa sideeye talaga ako. 

both of us have Engineering degrees and unlicesed but if you will compare our job experience, i think i have way better experince naman. hindi sa pagbubuhat ng sarili kong bangko but i have a almost two years experince sa dalawang construction companies and a job experince sa isang environmental NGO na which is very suited for the job position by the way since the position i am applying for is agriculture-related and requires to immerse in the community. isang beses palang ako nagtake ng board kahit 2020 pa ako nag grad. reason: need talaga kumayod. last boards na nagfail ako ay i was so mentally unstable kasi 50/50 non ang medical condition ng father ko after ng accident. 

wala lang. i am just disappointed. i can def look for other job position but (1) nakakahinayang rin kasi yung sahod kasi di mo yun madaling mahanap sa mga private companies, (2) need ko din talaga ng pera since kailangan pampagamot ng father ko and (3) ilang katulad ko pa kaya ang hindi nabigyan ng chance sa isang job vacancy ng mga government offices¬† dahil sa padrino system.

Nashow-cause order ng halos lahat sa departamento sa amin, dahil nahuli ng pinakaboss namin ung natutulog na empleyado, so akala namin siya lang, pocha halos 95% ng tao nabigyan ng show cause order, pero hindi na namin yon minamatter and dinidiin yung empleyado na iyon.

Nakalagay doon sa show cause order na NEGLECT OF DUTY kami, despite na may output naman kaming nilabas, so ung mga assistant boss namin, willing kaming tulungan sa department namin at nagpatawag ng mga meetings. Maraming beses kami nang mineeting pero etong dalawang meeting na ito ung tumatak talaga dahil sa kanya.

2nd meeting namin with the assistant boss, normal na usap lang na bakit ganon and explain naman kami na ginagawa naman po ung report namin, with matching evidence naman. (Tho isang specific duty lang naman pinakita and nakita, hindi pa kasama ung other scheduled duties) na walang nangyaring neglect of duty sa mga nadamay. 

After non, may inutos siya na, ikaw chief, may ganito naman palang problema, dapat tulungan mo ung tao mo, nirereport naman nila ung insidente sa iyo, bakit di nagagawan ng paraan? Ung ibang report, pa-generate naman. 

 ETO UNG LINYANG TUMATAK SA AMING LAHAT. 

""BAKIT AKO?""

Sinupalpal siya ng assistant boss na ANO BA? TAO MO YAN AH? TULUNGAN MO NAMAN YAN AT MGA NAKAYUKO NA.

""YES PO.""

Ginawa naman ung report, pero feel namin na napilitan lang siya sa pag-gawa non. After ginawa ung report. Except kay chief, sabay-sabay na kami na nagsubmit ng explanation sa Internal Department. Saktong dumaan ung lawyer doon na assistant boss din namin at may idea siya sa nangyari and kinausap kami ulit. Ginuide naman kami sa paano ung paglalagay sa Show Cause Order namin, and nagexplain naman kami kung ano ung nangyari and sabi niya, revise ninyo to, so okay lang naman yon para atleast mahelp kami. 

Habang nag-meeting kami, nag-submit na din pala siya ng response sa show-cause and pinatawag din siya. Tumabi siya sa akin and pinakinggan na ung mga sinabi namin.

Alam ninyo ung body movement niya na galaw ng galaw, hindi mapalagay, kinakamot ulo lagi like bruh ganyan ka pala and halos kinokontra lahat ng sinasabi nung lawyer.

Then sinabihan din siya na ikaw chief, tulungan mo sila sa pagrerevise kasi malalagot yang mga tao mo na yan. 

THEN GUESS WHAT, SHE SAID THE LINE AGAIN.

""BAKIT AKO?""

Kahit katabi ko boss ko, napatingin na lang ako sa isang katabi ko eh.

Hindi nagsalita ung lawyer sa kanya, nung nandon pa kami. Nagsalita siya nung pinadisperse kami at pinaiwan siya.

""Ano ka ba, ikaw ang boss ng mga ito, alam mo bang subject for dismissal yan mga yan tapos kinontra mo pa ako?""

Sabi nung chief namin: Joke lang po.

Meron naba dito naka-experience ng pinagmedical ng agency and nagbigay ng assurance na sure na daw na matatanggap ka sa work or company kung saan ka nila ie-endorse so pinagmedical na nila which amounting to P1,020 pesos. Pinagpasa rin ng requirements and then finally nabigay mo na yung endorsement letter sa company tapos sasabihin sayo na tatawagan ka nalang daw after ma evaluate ng documents and resume mo. In the end hindi ka matatawagan so it means hindi ka natanggap. 

I feel like na-scam ako since hindi nila tinanggap yung medical ko na 3 months old and meron daw silang affiliated medical clinic kung saan doon lang magpapa-medical. Ang theory ko is may porsyento itong agency sa medical clinic kada magpapadala sila ng tao na magpapamedical kahit hindi naman matatanggap sa company in the end. I also talked to other applicants which is same kame ng nangyare after interview sa company, sinabi lang rin ng HR ng company is tatawagan nalang daw sila pero since hindi ako natawagan, I doubt na natawagan sila.

&#x200B;

This could be a scam, a big one since marami akong kasabay na magpamedical na galing rin sa agency na yun, I estimate atleast 30 plus people were there. Tapos P1000 plus yung bayad kada person. Of course I could be wrong so Im asking you fellow workers if nangyari naba to sa inyo because it feels so wrong to take advantage to people na naghahanap ng work para magkapera pero gumastos pang medical pero hindi naman nagkawork.

2024-01-21 07:31:23,Text-only,Getting tired of sassy useless nepotism hire and unpaid OT pays.,"Sorry sa mahabaang rant T\_T  
For context, I work in a warehouse that houses parts boxes and newly produced parts for printers. Wala kaming pasok sana kahapon dahil may fiesta pero pinapasok ako para ayusin ang isang area. No problem, pasok = pera. Pagdating ko sa trabaho, may narinig ako na may nagsabi ""Bakit ayaw magtanong kung may pasok."" Buti na lang at may nagsalita pabalik na pinapapasok nga kami. Naabutan ko pa na pa-out na yung NH. Ang NH na ito ay nandoon lang dahil ang kapatid niya ay nagtratrabaho sa molding company na pinagtratrabahuhan ng warehouse namin. Lagi siyang nakaub-ob at nagpapahinga kapag walang request habang ang mga lalaking warehouse staff ang nagsosort at nagtataas/nagbaba ng mga boxes para sa kanya. Kapag rush pa ang mga boxes na request, tinatapon niya lang sa gilid ang mga basura at ako din maglilinis. Sinisigurado ko na palaging maayos ang area ko at sorted out at naitaas bago ako mag-out. Talaga lang tambak ang area niya ng mga boxes dahil kahit magsort ay hindi niya na ginagawa kaya yung area na dapat sana ay nagagamit namin ay natambakan ng mga boxes. Kaya nga ako pinapasok para maclear namin ang area na iyon. Narinig ko na lang siya magsabi na ""Porket may atm ka na, 'di ka na magwawalis"". Nakakagalit. Tuwing nightshift, naglalakad lakad ako para antukin at nakikita ko area niya na makalat at hindi pa sorted habang siya nakaub-ob sa tabi. Tumahimik na lang ako at sa isip ko, ""Malaki ang sasahurin ko sa dami ng OT ko"".  


Guess what? Dumating ang payslip ko at sa 65 hours na OT ko (24 hours ang hindi pa nabayaran noong December 1-15 at 41 hours ang OT ko nitong January 1-15, pero technically 37 hours and 47 minutes dahil hindi pa inapprove ang 3 hours at may butal ako na 13 hours) ay 46 hours at 47 minutes lang ang naapprove sa akin. Parang akong masusuka. I've never had a panic attack in a long while. About 16 hours ang hindi nabayaran. Kulang na ako sa tulog na, for the first time in my life, nagkaka-eye bags na ako. Tapos hindi pa nababayaran ang OT? Nakausap ko ang kasama ko at simula nga daw mahire ang accounting na iyon, lagi daw may problema sa sahod. Bakit hindi nila ayusin at tingnan kung anong ginagawa ng Payroll Staff? Busy ba sila na hindi maayos ng maganda ang sahod?  


Nagrarant kasi ako dahil andaming chechebureche na kailangan pagdaanan tapos ganito nangyayari. May biometric kami. May payroll site na pinagfifile-an ng mga OT na kailangan pang i-approve ng Warehouse Manager. Tinatawag pa namin ang mismong payroll staff. TAPOS, DUMATING ANG SAHOD NA KULANG. May mga kasama ako na nagsasabi na malaki na nga iyon, 'wag ko na daw masyadong isipin at maihahabol pa. WTF? So, bigay na lang ng libreng manpower?!?  


Pasensiya na sa pagrarant pero talagang nakakapagod. Ang sabi nga ay isang strike na lang sa DOLE at mapapasara na ang warehouse na iyon.

Si **Nag-resign,** bale last day niya January 15 (sinadya talaga for cut-off para buong sweldo backpay). But prior to that, dumating na yung kapalitan niya January 4. Kaya hetong si **Nag-Resign**, siyempre you know the drill, nagtu-turn over siya rito kay **Pumalit** sa kanya. Beterano itong si **Nag-Resign** kaya nakakapagtakang aalis siya, lagpas dekada na siya sa company. But even though ganu'n, ang dami niyang hindi naasikaso or mga pending task na umabot na ng taon dahil may nakalagay na 2022 pa sa turnover files niya. Medyo nakakainis lang kasi sa tagal niya, umabot siya sa ganu'n na hindi niya talaga inasikaso na.

Si **Pumalit Sa Nag-Resign**, pumasok siya January 4. So far, so good. Ang swerte niya kung tutuusin, bagay na hindi niya alam kasi maraming nakaabang sa kanya ng pera. By the way, yung mga pending task na tinutukoy ni **Nag-Resign** pera 'yon para sa **Pumalit Sa Nag-Resign**, alam ko napaliwanag sa kanya, pero ewan ko ba. Nakakwentuhan ko pa si **Pumalit Sa Nag-Resign**, kasama mag-coffee break, kwentuhan, binibigyan ko ng tips. Sinabi ko yung cons sa work, pero sobrang shallow lang talaga. Tsaka para sa kanya, ""Wala lang daw 'yon. Sanay na siya. Dine-deadma lang niya."" Basically, hindi niya masyadong dinadamdam yung cons na sinabi ko base sa mga sagot niya rin sa kwentuhan.

Lumilipas ang panahon, siyempre ayon na nga, tinuturuan ni **Nag-Resign** si **Pumalit Sa Nag-Resign**. Naririnig at nakikita namin kung paano niya turuan, okay naman talaga. Even Manager, Boss and Colleagues, which is kami 'yon, tinatanong namin siya na kung may tanong siya at concerns, huwag siya mahiya. Kasi hindi naman sarado mga utak namin knowing si **Nag-Resign** at mga pending tasks niya.

Wala na si **Nag-Resign** by Tuesday kasi nga hanggang January 15 lang siya. Kaya naman si **Pumalit Sa Nag-Resign** totoong trabaho na talaga. Pero ito na nga ang **plot twist**, si **Pumalit Sa Nag-Resign** by Thursday, 3rd day simula nung umalis na si **Nag-Resign** biglang nagpasa na rin ng **Resignation**. Sobrang daming nainis kasi ang daming sinayang at ang dami niyang inabala. Each Department Assistant Head, in-orient siya, siyempre kumain ng oras 'yon. Yung mga Manager na sobra kung mag-orient which I should know kasi naranasan ko kung paano sila mag-orient, ang sobrang okay talaga.

Tapos biglang umalis? Alam mo kung ano yung nakakainis? Yung ang dami niya pang ebas nung nakakakwentuhan ko pa siya, tapos malaman-laman pa namin, nagde-demand siya ng ibang gawain, gusto niya yung gawain ng isa niyang kasabayan na bago, kung pwede palit daw sila, yung wala ka pa nga napapatunayan, pero kung makapag-demand ka sa gusto mo maging trabaho mo. Naiinggit siya kasi yung isang kasabayan niya, wala masyadong ginagawa pero kasi wala naman din tasks du'n at walang kita rin du'n, basically I am talking incentives and/or commission here. Kaya nga sabi ko, ang swerte niya kung tutuusin. Para siyang yung mga fresh graduate na ang demanding, wala pa naman napapatunayan, resign agad, ina-anxiety, ganito, ganyan.

So, ito na nga, Friday na. January 19. Galit na galit mga Manager namin, nagra-rant na sa area dahil sa istorbong ginawa niya na sana nung nakikita na niyang tinuturuan pa lang siya ni **Nag-Resign** at nakikita niya yung sandamakmak na pending tasks nito, sumuko na siya. Nakailang tanong kasi sa kanya, kasi ganu'n talaga sa mga bago at sobrang open ng boss namin sa concerns, kasi naramdaman ko siya nung bago ako, sinasabi ko talaga napapansin ko at mga concern ko agad bilang baguhan nu'n. Anyway, ayon na nga, Friday January 19. Ito na yung **shocking twist**. Hindi na tatanggap ng new employee as replacement ni **Nag-Resign** at **Pumalit Sa Nag-Resign**. Kaya naman, yung pending task nilang dalawa, hinati sa mga kasama nila at kabilang ako, si **Napag-iwanan Ng Trabaho.**

Sa totoo lang, wala naman sanang kaso talaga. Ang problem kasi, wala siyang proper turnover. Imagine, nasa pag-a-adapt pa lang si **Pumalit Sa Nag-Resign**, obviously hindi niya pa gamay, in fact, hindi niya nga na-gets pala yung mga tinuro ni **Nag-Resign** sa kanya, nung Thursday lang din namin nalaman, kaya nga siya nag-resign kasi hindi niya na-gets din.

Biglang atang na lang sa'min ng mga pending task, biglaan lahat nung Friday, 3PM siya nangyari, muntikan pa ko hindi makipag-coffee break sa tadtad ng inquiries. Bigla niya lang pinasa yung contact details ko, and voila! Sunod-sunod na. Wala man lang siyang explaination sa kung ano gagawin namin sa pending, basta nag-email siya. Which is we don't understand basta table of details siya ng pending task niya pero wala kang mauunawaan sa **Remarks** kasi nga either blank or just some random information lang din bagay na walang indication kung ano 'yon.

**Ano rant ko? Nasira weekends ko ngayon.** Supposedly, aalis dapat ako. Pero dahil sa nangyari, buong araw akong nagtrabaho sa restday ko. Simula 9AM na gumising ako kanina hanggang ngayong 12:34AM na tina-type ko 'to, hindi pa rin ako tapos.

So kapag probi, hindi naman to required pero kapag regular ka na, kasama na to sa KPI.. ang pagiging ""reliever""... ikaw papasok sa  naka VL. Walang sapilitan pero keep in mind na kasama yun sa KPI. 

Maganda yung company na to pero I find this so BS. Fini flex pa nila na wala silang day-off dahil naging reliever sila. & now na bago ako rito, ineencourage nila na gawin ko yun dahil ang laki ng hatak sa KPI and syempre , OT pay mo rin to. 

Almost perfect sakin tong company. Siguro in the future, magiging reliever din ako pero baka once or twice a month lang.

I know kailangan ko ng pera pero ayoko ma-stress parati during day off na papasukan ko ung duty na un kahit na dapat pahinga ko that day.

Yung workload, yes hindi mabigat .. hindi ka lagi nakababad sa laptop pero kahit na. Masaya pa rin na during day off , sulitin mo.

Pero honestly, overall, 10 years na ko nagtatrabaho... hindi na ko takot sa grading, sa KPI. Basta hindi tinatanggal & nagta trabaho naman ako ng maayos.. kahit hindi 100% KPI ko.. ok lang sakin.

2024-01-19 12:15:46,Text-only,2 months palang felt like quitting na,"Bagong salta. Advertising/Publishing industry nga pala nature ng work ko.

No'ng una excited pako, kasi after more than 5 years makakalipat na. Walang issue previous company, naging comfty nako, masaya environment, dekalidad leadership, madami nang naging friends dahil sa engagement activities, tadtad ng trainings which is an advantage, upskilling din kasi. 'yun lang, yung sahod. Aminin natin, kelangan maka keep up sa living expenses yung sahod natin. Kaya ayon, nagdecide ako lumipat for a greener pasture.

Ngayon dalawang buwan nako pero yung pakiramdam ko parang isang taon nakong empleyado dahil sa hassle na naranasan at nararanasan ko. Wala akong kabatch na nahire. Utay utay sila maghire, ayon wala akong NHO, hindi ako familiar sa mga policies nila na ilang beses nang nagbago base sa mga memo's na narereceive ko sa email. Hindi pa naman ako entitled sa mga leaves ko keri.   


WALA DIN AKONG PROCESS TRAINING. Naintindihan ko yung expectation sakin nung ininterview ako. Tinanggap ko yung challenge. Ang hindi ko inexpect ee isasalpak ako sa trabaho na wala akong idea kung pano gawin. Oo, I have the skills and experience since I came from the same industry, pero magkakaiba ang process ng bawat company ee, iba iba din yung best practice. Entirely different business din tong pinasukan ko ang well aware yung employer ko sa nature ng product nung dati kong employer.   


1st week, papunta punta ako onsite na walang ginagawa, walang scheduled training, pero tinatanon ako ng manager anong ginagawa ko.??? Come 3rd day nung 1st week ko, nagtanong nako anong plans for me, training sched kung pwede paki block sa calendar ko para alam ko ieexpect. They proudly responded to me ""walang training plans."" 

2nd week, siguro dahil na din sa initiation ko, nagkaron bigla ng plans. Ok may idea nako sa overview. Pero tools, reporting, and jargon wala pa rin. Naging patient pa din ako. 

3rd week, di natuloy yung scheduled training, ipinasok ako sa ibang training na wala naman kinalaman sa role ko. Sa loob loob ko, sige na lang kesa wala akong gawin. 2 days lang yon. After nung 2 days training ulit, pero same lang sa training ko nung 2nd week. 

4th week, nag iimerse nako sa production, nagkipagkilala nako sa teammates bilang nag iisang new hire, dito pinilit ko nalang isipin na baka mas matuto ako pag ginagawa ko na yung mismong work. May natutunan naman ako, nalaman ko na pasikot sikot ng tools. Kaso may kulang pa din, hindi ko pa din talaga alam pano iprocess yung ibang request. Ang naiipprocess ko lang kasi lagi corrections. By the way walang proper delegation yung projects. Kung sino lang maisipang pagbigyan yun yung bibigyan ng task. Walang ownership from start to finish sa projects. Pwedeng ikaw magsisimula, pero iba ang tatapos ganon.   


Ayon nag 2nd month na ko't lahat ganyan pa din scenario. Not everyone was willing to help a newbie. Bad case pa sakin kasi expected to take a higher responsibility ako bilang co-lead. Another bad case is yung team lead namin walang alam sa process, so how am I gonna take a higher responsibility when my TL can't, si utos lang siya. and ako as co-lead will take instructions from the lead. Andami kong suggestions how to better implement changes and processes, pero it's falling on deaf ears because it will incur costs.   


This gets worse. Wala pa yung environment and gist of the kind of leadership pa lang yan nashare ko. Reklamador ba ko? Siguro. I can adjust sa process and best practices, matagal na ko sa corporate industry to not to know ang mga standard na kalakaran. Pero ang lala ng culture shock ko. Kaya sa mga nakakahanap ng swak na company para sakanila, sanaol. Baka I'm just bad at making decisions din. Rant lang. share your opinions, pero don't invalidate my struggle.

2024-01-16 21:33:38,Text-only,Refusal to Accept Additional Work,"I've been searching the web for any information regarding my current predicament:

Recently, my department was forced to have a ""re-organization"" due to the resignation of one of our members. So basically, one position was ""dissolved"" because they transferred the one assigned to that dissolved position to another role, however, the duties and responsibilities are not dissolve. Based on a close door discussion within some of our heads, it was decided to give those to me without even discussing it with my immediate superior to know whether i can accommodate the additional tasks. They just informed my immediate superior as an FYI basis, without discussing the reason why they chose me to shoulder this additional burden.

They set a meeting to discuss this change, at this point im still clueless to the decision of adding some tasks to me. My immediate superior talked to me one on one prior to the cascade of re-organization to inform me about this change of scope to my work. My position was that I cannot take additional workload and why did they think that I can handle additional workload when in fact neither me nor my immediate superior was consulted about it. The only reason they gave was the other person that they consider was already full.

What happened that day was the heads had a ""pre-meeting"" prior the discussion with us. My immediate superior raised my concern in that pre-meeting. So, what transpired was they parked the discussion of my added roles for another day. They asked to prepare a TMS to check whether I can accommodate the additional tasks.

My concern is that, despite my TMS showing that I cannot accommodate additional tasks, knowing our Senior head, they can position it that they have the full right to change my work load and not cooperating would merit willfull insubordination.

We will be having a discussion tomorrow and will i have strong legal support if I refuse to accept the additional tasks?

To add, there are other personnel that they choose but it seemed that they are insistent into me taking the additional roles as they don't asked other members to do TMS after they made aware of my stand that I cannot accommodate additional task.

Hoping someone can help me. Will highly appreciate if you can aldo help in providing specific legal provisions and actual case study as I was not able to find any similar case nor legal provision on the basis of refusal to take additional responsibility.

UPDATE: Just to update everyone na nakabasa ng hinaing ko. I already found another job with higher position and compensation. So parang blessing in disguise na din tong nangyari since na force ako to seek job outside my current and yun nga napaganda pa. 

As for the events related to my post. What i found out was that kaya pala ganun ang approach ng bagong head namin (internally promoted) because he felt na underloaded ako. His reasoning kung bakit gusto nya ako ioverload (1) when they asked me to cover for someone, i managed to do cover that person so sa kanya madami akong idle time to be able to do that (2) hindi daw nya ako masyado ramdam sa section na hinahawakan nya. 

To be fair my immediate superior and one of the LT defended me outright, na hindi totoo yung mga conclusions nya (sila din nagfefeedback sa akin ng mga nangyayari sa LT meetings nila kaya aware ako sa mga napaguusapan about me).

To clarify yung mga issues nya:

Issue 1: Nagawa kong magcover because at home nagtatrabaho and in werkends nagtatrabaho pa ako to cover kung ano man di ko ginawa dahil may urgent na need gawin like magcover ng ibang empleyado. And besides, this is work related, why is he not questioning other employees na nagagawang umattend ng kape at tsismisan sessions, bday bash, non-work related extra curricular activities.

Issue 2: The problem is hindi naman ako reporting sa kanya, so lahat ng activities ko is reported sa immediate superior ko. Later i found out na during editing ng monthly reports, tinanggal pala nung dating boss namin yung update ko since detailed update sya na hindi na masyado need ng top management since company metrics na lang pinepresent nila. And natigil pa yung group monthly meeting nila in which normally dun sya nadidiscuss. Lastly, for the past 2 yrs wala naman sya niraraise na issue about my output so why now, had he raised this earlier we could have made an alignment of expectations. 

So they officialized the additional role (walang adjustment sa compensation) but, through the help of my immediate superior we managed to convince the top management na i-spread out yung responsibilities sa iba ibang tao. But at this point I'm just buying my time to secure another job. Btw, alam ng immediate superior ko yung plans ko to resign kahit maayos yung sitwasyon since it's the values na ng next department head yung concern ko na I don't want to be in constant battle with the department head just because my prejudice na sya sa akin. Recently, since hindi nagsucceed yung plan nya to overload me the first time,, nagdevice na naman sya ng bagong scheme para ioverload na naman ako which failed again.

Tsismis na lang: isa pang hinala namin bukos sa unang dalawa nyang issues, ay dahil mas malaki sweldo ko kesa sa mga ka-chummy nya na pantay lang ng position ko (external hire ako). Kasi nalaman ko na lahat ng external hire someway or another may issue sya or pinepressure nya to take more responsibilities (not even explicitly discussing with them kung ano ba expected nya, na parang ang dating eh dahil mataas ang sweldo namin need nya makitang nagpapak@mat@y kami sa trabaho).

May lesson ba na dapat matutunan? Di ko din sure, pero eto mga narealize ko sa nangyari:

1. Make good connections. I managed to land a better job faster through the help of my former superior. Not expecting na in less than a month makakahanap agad ako ng lilipatan.
2. Know your worth. Kung di yun makita ng management, look somewhere na makikita ang worth mo. Di natin deserve to be in a constant battle within our own department. Nakakastress na nga yung interaction with outside the department kaya wag mo na idagdag.
3. Kung ayaw mo naman magpapalipat lipat ng work, know how to kiss a$s. Hindi kasi ako chummy sa bago naming manager kaya isa ako bigla sa pinag-iinitan

2024-01-16 18:37:14,Text-only,Usage of Service Incentive Leaves upon resignation.,"Hello everyone. Just want to seek advice regarding my current situation. I gave my resignation last Nov. 2023 to my company. Effectivity date is until end of Jan. 2024. The reason is I will enter my masteral degree which started last week. 

I still have leave credits. I have to be absent at least two working days a week until the month end. I filed my paid leave credits on those days but the HR said I can't use all of them (6) and will only be allowed to use/paid with at least two since ""the leave credits are computed as pro-rated for the the whole year"" 

Is this a correct practice?

2024-01-16 13:36:55,Text-only,How can I demand my Salary?,"How to demand for additional pay?

Hi.

So, I am working as operations assistant.

During interview I asked the scope of work and they said it is processing logistics and keeping up with the production. Typically what I usually do is forward orders to the production floor and prepare all the items for deliveries and booked for pick ups.

I do not mind doing some graphic post, but recently. I was asked to make a catalog of all our products, answer inquiries in our SNS.

My salary is Php500.00/day (provincial rate) and I am no work no pay. That Php500 is for the operations assistant. Now, lately, I noticed my tasks are getting more and more and it is not part of my job description.

Graphics? Catalog? Product Shoot? Aren't  those work for Marketing and PR?

My boss added Php500 on my weekly pay when I started replying to our SNS. I do not mind replying and all, but after working hours and during my rest day (Sundays), I do not reply immediately because I believe that it is not my priority as my working hours is done, but I noticed that my boss is getting naggy when I do not reply immediately or if I missed something during those times.

Things are getting exhausting. I want to demand for extra pay for the extra work, but I do not know how to. I like what I do (packing and all), but the extra tasks is making me feel exhausted.

Mind you, I worked half day on last Dec 24th and Dec 31st, they only pay me Php250/day for that. I didn't receive any pakunswelo de bobo. It just disappointing. 

I am planning to resign, but I still do care about how they will do things if I left, and the location of my work is quite ideal another factor why i do not want to leave. Hahahaha

Anyway to summarize. Here's  what I've been doing for my Php500.00/day and a no work no pay job:
‚Ä¢ ALL OPERATIONS
‚Ä¢ CUSTOMER SUPPORT
‚Ä¢ MARKETING

Felt like I am running my business yet I am not the one who earns the sales. ü•π

So ayun, on the third week I've requested to use my remaining 2 VL since sayang naman, then di ako pinapayagan since wala na daw matitira.

Nakakatawa tayong mga alipin ng salapi. Imbes na maging magkakampi tayo para labanan ang mga mayayamang kapitalista na uma-alipin sa atin, tayo pa ang nag-a-away-away at nagkakasalungat ng opinyon

Sobrang nakakatawa tayo, na ayaw natin sa mga unyon at nag-i-strike, ayaw natin sa collective bargaining at ayaw din natin sa mga job hoppers. Wala tayong class solidarity

Maybe I'm too harsh pero kung nababayaran lang ng tama ang mga empleyado ayon sa kanilang outputs at nabibigyan ng tamang benepisyo, wala namang magpapalipat-lipat ng trabaho 'diba? Sabi nga nila, kung kasipagan lang ang batayan ng sahod, dapat milyonaryo na ang mga magsasaka at mga labandera. Kung tutuusin, napakahirap na laging maghanap ng bagong trabaho at mag-aral ng bagong kaalaman

Isa ding tanong ko, sa napakaliit na P20,000 na kita ng ordinaryong mangggagawang Pilipino, tingin niyo, magkano ang katumbas na kita ng mga may-ari ng negosyo? For example lang, sa Accenture ka nagtatrabaho. Kung kumikita ka ng P30,000 a month, tingin mo, magkano 'yung totoong budget na binibigay ng client mo sa Accenture? Tingin mo ba, papayag 'yung Accenture na mas malaki ang cut mo?

Sa kakaunting mga kakilala ko na 6-digits o lampas pa ang sahod, wala NI ISA sa kanila ang tumagal ng 10 years sa work. Maaring merong iilan, pero either nepo-hire, nagtapos sa Big 4, madaming connections, o di kaya mga statistical outliers (sinwerte ng sobra). Siguro kung kasama kayo sa statistical outliers, then good for you. Kung ""good"" ang company mo, then good for you too. Pero job hopping is an advice that might not be valid for you, but for the other 99.999% of the working population

Pakialamero na kung pakialamero pero kung pagiging pakialamero at baliw ang mangarap ng mas magandang mundo, na lahat tayo ay matataas ang sahod at hindi kinakailangan na maging mga alipin ng salapi, mas maganda pang maging baliw na lang ako

Towards the end, we were just chatting about random stuff when Lea mentioned na she had been in the industry for more than 10 years na daw so I asked if she had met our team leaders, one of which is Amy. 

Lea said they were able to work on several projects before then she mentioned that never nya daw nakita na kumain si Amy and ang laki daw ng pinayat nya. Probably because of stress din daw. 

Nick casually adds, ‚ÄúReally? Parang malaki pa din naman si Amy ngayon,‚Äù then looks at me for validation. 

I was taken aback kasi as an insecure person, a comment like that is the last thing I would want anyone saying about me. I ignored him and told them how Amy climbed through the corporate ladder and how much na yung naaccomplish nya.

I know naman na given na sa pagiging nurse ang toxic na duty. Pero iba talaga ang bigat ng workload sa public hospital. I am handling an average of 15-20 patients per day. Sa bilang na yan kasama jan ang 2-3 intubated patients/critical beds. Kasama din jan yung mga may awaiting OR schedule at iba pang procedure na toxic din. We have like 40 hours per week work schedule may instances na 12 hours per day minsan naman 8 hours lang pero usually OTY kasi hindi kaya ng walong oras sa dami ng errands at orders ng mga doctor. Kadalasan din ang rest day ay sleeping off lang kasi galing ng night duty. There's no such thing as work-life balance anymore. 

Back in November, dito ko nafeel yung burnout. Sobra yung pre-shift anxiety ko na wala ako ginawa kundi umiyak bago pumasok. I feel like giving up pero buti na lang holiday season came in kaya medyo nabawasan yung census namin.

2024-01-11 21:33:03,Text-only,Corporate culture is going to drain the soul out of me,"I'm an artist by nature and expertise. I just graduated IT and I'm trying to be realistic with my career choice kaya hindi ko pinursue ang pagiging full time artist. I'm not good at IT at all and it's a miracle how I got my degree, that's why I'm pursuing freelancing and virtual assistant jobs. I have all the clerical skills needed, I have graphic design skills, MS Office, Adobe, lead generation, social media management, WordPress and all that.

For the past few months I've been immersing myself in ""corporate culture"" in preparation for job hunting. I took a short course din and it's part of the training to be familiar with all this. Yung pananalita, cover letters, LinkedIn, resum√©s, portfolios, CEOs and HR. The more I am in this space, the more I'm starting to lose my mind.

Parang everything is just so self centered. I mean I get it I really do. I want a job too, for me. It's not like I care about a company wholeheartedly kaya ko gusto makapasok sakanila, right? That's the problem, sa interview pa lang you have to be enthusiastic about the job and the company. It all feels so superficial, but we have to do it to earn any sort of worth for ourselves. Tell me why an interviewer and I are engaged in a purely English phone call for a position that doesn't require me to speak, both of us trying to mask our Filipino accents, just to appease the corporate entity? I'm not trying to sound edgy but it's true.

And who would've thought na konting tweaks lang pala sa resum√© would land you an interview? No need to upskill in anything, no. In the interview just be better at talking and overselling yourself and you're all good. Just straight up lying is how everything works in corporate? Just be convincing? Hindi na ba nagbabase sa skills and competence ang position? Bentang benta ba sa interviewers kapag pinormahan mo sila ng social skills mo?

Not to mention marketing. You're telling me someone out there can convince me to buy dog sh!t because he has the marketing skills? I'm just slowly going insane the more I look into the behind the scenes. Does no one care about anyone anymore? Do we all only ""care"" about a person if they're generating income for the company? Where is the altruism in all this? Parang all the skills and personal growth na na-achieve at pinag-aralan mo, ang purpose lang pala non ay para makapag benta ka ng product?

Worst part is I know I have to play this game kung gusto ko maka-survive sa araw araw. I want to be successful too pero idk how I'll be competing with the most soulless marketing rep out there who has the ability to sell you a piece of fudgee bar worth your entire retirement fund, without feeling a thing.

Then here comes the other supervisor referring a ""friend"" (Brother of her husband) to join my team. The f*cked up thing here is I got bypass and directly referred  it to our manager (which is her office bestfriend) and passed the interview.

The referral was over-qualified, around 50's, previous work was a general manager of his own firm (bankrupt by pandemic). His experience is a lot but its not aligned with what we needed in the team.

My manager is now insisting to hire the referral to provide guidance to me and my team with his experience, since they see us as a young team (in short having a seniority).

Honestly I see it as a threat to my position but what I can't really sacrifice is the collaboration of my team right now. It would technically disrupt the workflow.

Anyway, I just want to ask your opinions on how I should go about this situation. For context, I am an overseas Filipino teacher and last year, I was the only Filipino left in our faculty. Months later, the school hired 4 more Filipinos and I was so happy kasi finally, may makakausap na ako! üò´üò≠ The previous Filipino co-workers that I had were nice people so I miss having that warm connection kaya I can‚Äôt believe a fellow Filipino would do this behind my back. ü•≤

I helped the 4 of them ease up in our workplace and also assisted them regarding visa matters, accommodation, transpo, work-related paperwork, etc., without thinking much about it. I want to give back and pass on the kindness and warmth that my previous Filipino co-workers did for me. Until, nag-away2 sila kasi iisa lang ang apartment nila. Their personalities just don‚Äôt click, ika nga. 1 of them eventually left the school and 3 of them stayed. Tapos nag-aaway na naman sila hanggang naging 2 (let‚Äôs call them Terry and Tina) vs 1 (Lenny) na. I clarified to both sides na I don‚Äôt want to get involved and to keep their misunderstandings between them. I told them to communicate and just be civil with one another if it‚Äôs beyond repair. I thought it worked. 

Fast forward a few months later, Lenny, yung nag-iisa na lang, spread gossip about me to other students that Terry, Tina and I daw are the reason why the teachers don‚Äôt like staying in the office. 

I was so surprised kasi ni hindi nga ako nangingialam sa away nila at sa kanya personally. And she just asked for my help 2 weeks ago about a non-work related stuff and I still helped her out thinking we‚Äôre okay. The students did not believe her crappy story and told me about it because they know my personality and attitude in and out of work. 

I also learned that she is hanging out with the other foreign teachers outside of work and I felt like the other foreigners won‚Äôt hang out with the rest of the Filipinos na lang kasi she had already tainted our reputations to them. 

The students told me that she (Lenny) asked them which teachers they like and the students replied that they prefer me (kasi siguro mas matagal na ako) and Terry, to which Lenny replied, ‚ÄúIf they are nice to you, well, not to us. The other teachers don‚Äôt like staying in the office because of them.‚Äù 

Nakakaput@ng1n4 talaga. I am hurt and disappointed kasi fellow Filipino pa ang gumagawa non and I haven‚Äôt done anything to her personally to make her react that way towards me.

Regular 8-5 office job sa government, entitled ako sa mga benefits na almost the same sa regular (FYI Im not a permanent employee). Pero dahil ang dami kong workload at mag-isa ko lang gagawa nung trabaho, I found myself working during the holidays and weekend. Madalas pa akong mag-uwi ng trabaho just to accomplish my tasks on time and yet hindi ito nare-recognize ng management. Almost 4 years na ako sa institution na yun pero palagi akong hindi nakukuha for regular appointment sa government. Syempre you know naman pag sa government (palakasan). Sobrang mentally exhausted ako kasi kahit weekend may nagcha-chat sa messenger ko or sa phone number about sa work. Tapos hindi ako nauubusan ng trabahong ginagawa. Kaya napakadalang ko mag leave nun unless very important. Once na nag-leave ako, maiiipon lang nang maiipon ang trabahong iniwan ko. Unlike sa ibang department, they have colleagues who can take over their job pag absent si employee. I tried to subtly tell my concern sa supervisor ko pero yung pag-kuha ng assistant is not their priority. Tapos despite na nagpupuyat ako para matapos ang trabaho, they keep on pushing me to work faster. Indirectly nilang sinasabi na ""Nasaan na? Tapos na ba?"". May mga iba pang dahilan kung bakit ako nag-resign pero I dont want to disclose it any further. May ipon pa naman ako, naka reserve to pay my monthly bills. Since 12/23/23 unemployed na ako.

Like nagkwento yung HR manager na may mga applicants daw na nirereject JO nila even though pasok yung expected salary, kasi nakahanap ng mas better na offer. For me kaya nga yung isa yung tinanggap eh. Kasi nga BETTER. Kesyo nahahassle daw sila kasi nga ang tagal ng proseso tapos irereject lang JO. Sana daw di ako ganun.

Bakit daw xxx,xxx yung asking ko eh 29 lang daw ako. May pamilya daw ba akong binubuhay. Breadwinner daw ba ako. Etc? Eh yung asking ko pasok naman sa ads nila sa jobstreet. Saka yung current ko almost ganun nadin so pataas talaga hihingin ko di naman pwede bumaba. Kailangan ko bang may pamilyang binubuhay para majustify expected salary ko?

Out of courtesy I just smiled and answered their questions professionally. If may questions or followups daw itext ko lang sila.

One week after, wala pading balita. So nagfollowup ako via text. No response.

After that, I assumed na wala na. Right after a week may JO nadin ako sa ibang company na mas ok na friendly mga HR. May start date nadin ako 

Tapos kahapon nagchat yung recruiter, may update na daw sa application ko. Dinedma ko lang kasi sobrang na off na ko sa interview, tapos hindi pa ko nireplyan 4 weeks ago. Kahit manlang sabihin na waiting for update. Wala eh. So hindi ko na nireplyan

Kanina tumawag yung HR manager, if open padin ba ako. I just said I followed up weeks ago and got no response thus i assumed na I did not get the role. And may JO nadin ako.

After 3 weeks, I did a follow up and said na yung CI na ginawa nila could negatively impact me in my company kasi potentially, i would be in attrition list which means hindi ka bibigyan ng project and alay ka for low rating. HR came back and said the hiring manager would not push thru hiring me kasi mag kaka salary imbalance sa team kasi puro home grown daw yung sa team.

2024-01-04 11:15:07,Text-only,De Minimis allowance and SL reset,"Hi everyone. I'm not really sure if this is the correct subreddit to post this question and this is my first work po kasi but I just wanted to ask for your advice regarding 2 things:

1. Nag absent ako before (notified my TL) and since probi palang ako, hindi kami pinagagamit ng leave even though we already accrue leave credits since day 1. So nag LWOP ako nun and then nakita ko sa next payslip ko yung De Minimis allowance ko nabawasan. I asked payroll regarding this and they said that HR advised them that kasama sa bawas yun since hindi ako pumasok. Question is tama ba yun? If so, or not, meron ba kayong link or document regarding this information sa De Minimis?

2. Since nag aaccrue na nga kami ng SL and VL since day 1, nakapag accrue na kami ng 6.25 SL in total since nag start kami Aug 2023. Jan 2024 nag reset sya to 1.3 at ang explanation sa amin ay dapat talaga magrereset sya since di ginagamit. Ang nakakapag taka dun eh hindi naman namin pwede gamitin in the first place so talagang di sya magagamit. Question is again, tama ba yun or allowed po ba yung ganon?

Excluded ang lunch nun. 6 months na ako at regular na din. Pero nagreklamo tong Accounting Manager namin kasi late daw kami pumapasok like lagpas na ng 9AM pero di lagpas ng 9:30. I was like, ang pagkakainform sa akin ng OM namin na until 9:30 ang pasok. Tapos nagagalit sya na 5:45 umaalis na kami. Take note, halos araw araw yung lunch break namin hindi umaabot ng 1 hr. Kasi kapag 10 mins tapos na kami kumain, nagtratrabaho na ang lahat. Kasi kapag sinabi nila na kapag tapos na kumain, may pinapagawa na agad.

His name is Alfonso James Lacson. He claims to have a lot of SUCCESSFUL businesses under his belt. Namely D'Lacs, GIB (Gourmet in a Box). He will alsi claim to have established Palpitate. He will claim that he has a farm (does not specify what type, nor does respond properly to inquiry), he will also claim to have a resort and many more. Basically he claims to have a lot and accomplished a lot, which are all very questionable since it either does not exist or he cannot give proof. 

His modus: he likes hiring students that are looking for work. He specifically targets those who are deperate with work. He will promise lots of things like incentives, but fails to pay out their salary.

How do i know: i work with him at GIB, he was always delayed with giving out salaries, the delay gets longer and longer over time to the point where he owes his employees a whole month's worth. He still hasn't fully paid my salary until now. That's 3 months worth of salary from a year ago.

Why this guy sucks beyond what was already mentioned. He loves posting online, he constantly looks for ""investors"" for his business. He will basically offer ""investors"" a ln 8% cut of the monthly profit but the payout is locked every 6 months or more, the contract is good for 3 years. What ge doesn't tell the ""investors"" is how the profit is calculated. He tell the ""investors"" there are only 10 slots, which translates to the investors getting 80% of the total PROFIT all together, but in reality, he grabs additional investors behind the backs of the original 10 and promises the same 8%. He keeps doing this to keep getting more money to pay out his first batch of ""investors"" basically a ponzi scheme.

How does this guy earn money if he gives all the profit away? The resturant gets its stock from him. The resturant buys the stocks from him.

He also like to throw around shit like ""lawyer up"" when his young and inexperienced staff asks about their salary, ir when his ""investors"" even inquire about the business. He plays the victim every step of the way while getting the sales (yes, raw sales) from the store to buy his personal shit like a bottle of red wine which he will consume in the same store where he got the money from, in front of the staff he doesn't pay salaries to, because of his reason ""the store doesn't have enough sales""

Dear All OICs, AOICs, ________________ and staff, 

Starting January 2024, the following changes in OT and commission will take place. Please read carefully and understand. If you have any questions, please feel free to send me message. I will answer all questions, so we can make this new policy as clear as possible to everybody. 

*OVERTIME* 

As per general policy, we will discourage unnecessary overtime (OT) to reduce our operations expense. However, for certain situations, OT will be allowed subject to approval by ME or by your area managers or regional manager. 

ALL OTs should be pre-approved before the actual schedule. Please send me the OT form together with written explanation why OT is necessary for that particular situation (example : 3 day sale, extended mall hours, shortage of staff due to leave). 

For OT approval AFTER the schedule, please send me the OT form together with written explanation for the OT and corresponding proof indicating the need to do OT (example, sales report with time stamp signifying the time for the transaction). 

All unauthorized OTs (without approval) will not be paid by accounting.

Just to be VERY CLEAR: OT is stilled allowed, but OIC needs to justify the OT of every staff. UNAUTHORIZED OT will not be paid. 

*COMMISSION:* Take note, this change will affect SALES STAFF ONLY. 

Sales STAFF should have a minimum sales transactions and/or amount for them to receive their commission. If the staff fails to reach the minimum allowed sales transaction or amount, the sales staff will not receive their commission for the month. Only the add-ons will be released. 

By definition, TRANSACTION means complete prescriptions or frame only. All contact lens, CL solutions and accesories sales are not included in this total transaction. 

The following will be the minimum: 

Full Time Sales Staff:
15 transactions a day or 390 transactions per month OR 
‚Ç±300,000 sales¬† a month 

Sales/Asst Cashier or Sales/Asst Technician: 
10 transactions a day or 260 transactions per month OR
‚Ç±200,000 sales a month 

Sales Staff who continually do not reach their required number of sales transactions or amount for 2 consecutive months will be given a warning.
2 consecutive months - verbal warning 
4 consecutive months - written warning 
6 consecutive months - suspension 3 days
8 consecutive months - suspension 7 days
10 consecutive months - suspension 15 days
12 consecutive months - termination 

All probationary sales who will not reach the minimum target for 5 months will not be regularized. (3rd month evaluation is needed) 

We will have a revised quota form for next year to include the number of transactions for each sales staff. Please make sure the numbers in the quota form are correct and accurate. We will check the figures in the forms vs the encoder report. All incorrect numbers in the form will be considered as falsified and corresponding disciplinary action will be given to whoever is responsible. 

Effectivity of sanctions will take effect starting March 2024 commission. We can start implementing these in our stores as early as January 2024. No penalties, sanctions and forfeiture of commission yet for January and February 2024. 

For OT, start by reducing unneccesary OTs of the staff. No need to send for approval yet. 

For the sales commission, inform the sales staff of the change so they will be ready when this is implemented by March 2024. 

Everything written above is subject to change and will be finalized during OIC meeting in February.

Thank you for your cooperation. Again, for inquiries and clarifications, pls viber me.
Reminder about the memo regarding OT and sales staff:

Please discuss these with your staff properly during a proper meeting, and not just share in your group chat. Let them know that it will be implemented after the OIC meeting. If they have questions about the memo, please take note so we can have a discussion during the OIC meeting.

If there are negative reactions from staff, PLEASE make sure that you reply to them POSITIVELY.",15,12,0.86,Company alert üö©,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/18vqy1k/shoutout_sa_labor_violator_na_company_na_ito/,18vqy1k

Pero hindi ba to valid na kina kabahan lang ako, at final interview ko na ito. Normal lang na paghandaan ko ang mga possible na tanong para sa ganitong sitwason. 

Sinabihan pa ako na may problema daw ako psychologically, or nang rereverse psychology ba daw ako sa mga taong makakaharap ko para makuha gusto ko. Dagdag pa Na may galit ba daw ako sa sitwasyon ko na mahirap lang ako. At yung passion ko daw hindi totoo kasi ang hinahangad ko lang ay pera hindi trabaho. Basta ang dami niyang sinasabi na isa daw akong arrogante, feeling superior daw ako. Doble kara, sinama nya pa pamilya ko na galit ba daw ako sa kanila dahil sa sitwasyon namin ngayon na mahirap.

Sumbat naman ng manager papayag ba daw ako na yun din starting ko. Sabi ko hindi, at nag reason out ako na sa huling trabaho ko, Nahihirapan ako i manage yung income na yun. Sabay sabi nila, kahit daw magkano salary ko. Kung di daw ako madisiplina sa pera, kahit magkano daw ay hindi talaga isasapat. Grabe, ang daming judge na nangyari sakin sa interview na yun. Tinaasan hanggang 15,000. Final na daw, sabi ko hindi nalang muna. Inisip ko kasi, napakadsming panghuhusga na nangyari sakin during that time at dagdag pa na sinama pamilya ko. naisip ko din na hindi ko nga kinaya mentally pang huhusga sakin, how much more if employed na ako sa kanila?

My supervisor in A is the epitome of a ""nepotism baby"" and we clash horribly. The President sees him as his ""son"" and grants him undeserved favor, despite his childish and disrespectful behavior. We clash at every turn, and honestly, I've considered leaving multiple times. This drove me to depression mid-year, but I focused on doing good work for A, B, and C.  
However, the President noticed my talent, didn't want to give me up, and gave me this promotion with the additional responsibility of two more startup companies. (These are startup companies from a known conglomerate in PH) There are other shared-service people in the office, but I handle everything marketing-related, from conceptualization to execution, without any dedicated support. 

Despite surviving Company A with a very difficult manager for over a year, I also focused on excelling with the other companies. But now, the pressure is on again. They're adding another company, Company D, next year, diluting my focus even further. From 33% per company, I'm expected to manage with just 25% of my time with a raise that will reach 6 digits. Yet, no additional staff! That's so absurd, and they are stretching me like a rubber band, even if they are rewarding good work with more work.

I love my work colleagues and juniors in A, B, and C. They respect me, and I was given peer recognition during our last year-end party. Some managers likes me too. But the disrespectful nepo baby, the President's favoritism and the insane workload that awaits me next year are crushing me.

Do I stick it out for the sake of ""good work"" or prioritize my sanity by resigning? It's hard to leave my colleagues, and I have only stayed in the company for more than a year.

He hates me because I complained to the head office all the mismanagement, him looking down to other employees, yelling at us, and telling us to fire someone just because they answered back to his message since apparently he said ""A manager shouldn't be talking to the low class employee who has no power"".. 

So, I know he's been looking forward to kick me out in the office because he can't stand that I look at him in the eyes quietly whenever he's yelling at me because I know I didn't do anything wrong, he hates that ""I look proud of myself"" when he's yelling at me.

2023-12-27 15:57:18,Text-only,Is it worth it to stay sa company na intern status ka for 9 months?,"I need your advice people. I signed up to be an intern sa isang IT company called O******s. Instead of being hired as an employee, I will be a consultant if mag regular na. They have this thing called ""Academy"" wherein they will train you for 3 months and may bootcamp daw the next 6 months. The allowance I have now is 20k no tax and no benefits. They did say na magkaka significant increase daw during bootcamp. So in total, it would take 9 months before regularization. It's kinda suspicious na din for me kasi 9 months prior to regularization? Usually it's just 3 or 6. Sa 9 months na yon walang benefits at all unlike sa other companies. Medyo skeptical na ako kasi parang andaming bad reviews and yung work schedule parang di na maka tao. Now nasa 3 month training ako which will end this January and switching schedule from 6 am to 2 pm and 2 pm to 10 pm every 2 weeks. Sa bootcamp daw may additional switching schedule na 10 pm to 6 am pero monthly na ang switching. May option na wfh like once a week pero may schedule na weekends papasok ka parin. What I've noticed is that sa company na to, walang holidays. Walang double pay pero ""premium pay"" lang ang sabi. Tapos HMO lang at yung SSS is ikaw pa maghuhulog. Binibida nila na tax free ang regular employees daw pero ayon no benefits din at mas malala no 13th month pay. Performance bonus lang daw which is again, suspicious. Parang labag na labag sa rules ng DOLE and parang outsourcing agency lang? Another thing is, andaming bakanteng position sa senior level? Then nag mamass hire interns na sobrang baba ng allowance for an RTO set up sa city. Pag mag regular daw yung sweldo around 60k na din but no yearly increase unless sipsip ka daw sa management.

So kung maalala niyo, ako ang nagpost ng shitty rant about sa company where Deej is the endorserrrrrrrrrr.. IYKYK https://www.reddit.com/r/AntiworkPH/s/AYB7KOdvzC 

So part 2 lang. December 1, nalaman ko na 283rd ang Alliance Group of Companies sa ""PH forbes best employer in the world."" Kassma rito ang liquor company na pinag ttrabahuhan ko. Wow 283rd BEST EMPLOYER sa buong mundo. Ang galing! Also, they earned Billions of money in 9 months wow ang galing!!!!! Pero ang baba ng sahod ng mga taong nagiging susi kung bakit kumikita ng ganon kalaki yung kumpanya. Proud pa yung HR manager na nasa 283rd kami na best employer. Walang best employer kung hindi niyo kayang pangalagaan mga empleyado ninyo. Ang tunog ng pangalan niyo sa labas, pero ang bulok at ang papangit ng mga taong nasa loob. :) 

Una, bulok ang sistema. Lahat ng bagay don manual pa rin. ü§£ Timekeeping, attendance. Halos lahat nabubuhay na sa system, pero kami naiwan ata kami sa biometrics at dtr. ü§£ Nagrereklamo na mga empleyadong taga branches lalo na ang mga brand promoters kasi late ang pasahod sa kanila, paano ba naman kasi, dtr pa rin ang galawan. Yung ibang kumpanya nag invest sa HR System. Pero kami nastuck, hahaha bilyon kinikita ng kumpanya pero ayaw maglabas ng pera para mapabilis ang galaw ng mga empleyado sa loob. Takot magrisk ang mga matatandang nasa position kasi gusto nila alagaan yung ""legacy"" nila. Legacy my ass. Mamamatay na kayo, pero kami matagal pa kaming mabubuhay, inuuna niyo lang mga sarili niyo mga hayop kayo. 

Pangalawa, pansin niyo, mga pic ng advertising namin ay plain? Laging nag playsafe yang mga nagdedecide non at naglalabas or nagpopost non. Pano kasi, kahit may mga magandang ideya sila, laging nirereject ng mga nasa taas. Ang gaganda ng mga advocacy, ang gaganda ng ads ng ibang company, kami nastuck sa playing safe. Ayaw kasi aprubahan yung mga magagandang ideya. Hahaha kaya maraming umaalis na batang marketing eh lols. 

Pangatlo, ""Ay nagpapaiyak ka ng empleyado"" - sabi ng HR manager namin. ""Oo, marami nang umiyak sa akin"" - sabi ng Internal Credit Audit Head. ""Ay talaga? Hahaha Ang galing mo naman"" - Sabi ng HR manager. Nagpintig yung tenga ko rito. Hahahahaha. Bakit niyo ginagawang tropy ang may napapaiyak na empleyado? Ganyan ba kayong may mga inferioty complex hiding from your superiority complex? Hahaha. HR manager ka pa naman, pero ok ka sa ganong palakad. Yikes. 

Pang-apat. I source for talents sa company namin specifically Luzon provinces. Maraming nagreresign sa area ko because of big offers from other companies, so nabutas yung area ko and luckily, mabilis din ako magsource. Bago mag christmas, almost 5 people resigned sa area ko, yubg katabi ko and kateam ko, abg saya niya na nauubos yung sa area ko. Same kami na Luzon area. Proud na proud siya na may nagreresign sakin sa kaniya wala. And di naman ako affected sa mass resignation and december resignation, kasi expected ko na yon lalo na etong patapos na ng taon. For sure mas marami yan ng jan to feb. Sabi niya ""Okay lang yan *insert my name*"" full smile, halata mong nang-aasar siya. Sabi ko ""Hindi naman siya nakakalungkot. Expected na pangyayari naman na yon, so di ako bothered sa resignations. Eh plus, recruitment naman ako, trabaho ko maghanap"" tas di ako pinansin hahaha. My workmate na yon, favorite siya ng HR director namin kasi she was from UST and fsvorute din siya ng HR manager namin, kasi vibes sila pagdating sa branded things. And eto yung kinwento ko sa part 1 na walang expi pero 18k ung offer tas ako na may expi 17.5k yung offer. Lols. This workmate also competes with me. So december 11-15 ang pasahan ng attendance ng branches namin, take note manual namin itong ginagawa hahaha. December 13, tapos na ako, so I asked our immediare supervisor if ipprint na for checking. Sabi ng immediate sup ko, go and print para macheck niya na rin. So this co worker, biglang sumigaw ng ""WAG"". Tas sabi ng immediare sup namin ""Bakit?"" And she told some alibi na di ko maintindihan. Hahahaha kasi nagprint ako. So ayon, naprint na, naipasa ko na. I can see her rushing her attendance, and before lunch, tapos na siya. Dali-dali siyang nagprint, and pinasa kay immediate sup. So fast forward, nabalik na sakin yung ginawa ko for revision and luckily, wala pang 5 yung revision sakin, so naayos at naprint ko agad. And done na ako, balik ako sa recruitment. Tas naoverheard ko silang dalawa ng immediate sup namin na nag uusap, mali mali yung gawa ni UST girl na paborito ng lahat na nakikipag compete. Abg dami niyang mali and she even said ""Hala bakit ang dami kong mali?"" Abd our immediate sup said ""Ewan ko sayo"" while laughing jokingly. So marami tuloy siya revision. After that, submission na sa manager, so we are tasked to print sa clean paper. Nagmamadali na naman siya unahan ako, edi hinayaan ko siya. Hahahaha, mali na naman nagawa niya. Lahat ng attendance naprint niya sa scratch so umulit sya. Hahaha. ü§£ Whata funny thing. Gusto mo mauna pero nasstall ka ng kalokohan mo. 

Fifth, mahirap makipagsabayan sa mga tao ron, ang hirap din makimingle. Hahahaha, u know why? If you can't afford to buy things theycan afford, mararamdaman mo yung exclusion sayo ron.

Dahil dito, hndi ako nktulog at nkkain ng ilang araw at ngdecide ako na umabsent muna.

Ung absent ko nging LOA na tumagal ng ilang buwan, during this time hindi ako pnyagan gamitin ang leaves ko and so wala akong pay nito. I‚Äôm on antidepressants narin.

Merong pinipirmahan tungkol sa bawal ang nepotism. Pero nasa head office halos nagkakamag anak mga managers, kung hindi magkakamag anak, mga magkakakilala. Akala ko ba bawal nepotism? Bakit ang daming mag kakamag anak???

Walang inclusivity. Ayaw kapag part ka ng LGBT community. Ang daming nag aapply samin na part ng LGBT community, WITH ALL THE GREAT SKILL, ayaw tanggapin ng marketing, kasi nga Gay siya. So nareject.

- Expected salary not met (kasi unfair daw sa mga matatagal na sa company. mind you, i‚Äôm a licensed professional and sila, nakapagtapos ng course that is not in line with the industry). Yung sweldo ko ngayon, naeearn ko sa previous employer ko while being a non-licensed professional at that time. May benefits pa like insurance and healthcare. Dito wala lmaaoooo

- Not entitled to OT pay. Sabi sa ad, 30-40k swelduhan. Pagdating sa payday (yes payday ko pa nalaman sweldo kong totoo) nagtanong ako if entitled ako for OT. Sabi hindi na raw kasi ang budget lang for me is 20k. But ginawa nilang 30k (less benefits pa and all) as premium. So dahil premium na nga raw sweldo ko, di na raw ako entitled to OT. PS: umaabot kami minsan ng 10pm. Meetings yun plus dinner (bayad ng boss namin syempre lol)

- No proper instruction and turnover. Mahilig pa maghugas kamay yung kawork ko. Eh manok ata nung isang head namin. Kaya nung may maling report na sakin nasisi (dahil hindi raw ako nagbase sa past reports ng kawork ko), sabi niya lang eh kahit tanungin ko raw head namin, tama raw at naayos at nareview report niya.

Sobrang unjust ng nangyari, that time.

Going back, nag email na ako ng resignation, again Im a probi, no need ng approval but the next company requires me a signed resignation letter?

I got ""hahahaha"" ""ayoko nga"" and ""angry reax"" sa message ko na nakikisuyo nang maayos.

Add, the HR told me na , usually 2weeks na lang dapat ko irender.

Finally, November 2022 may tumanggap na din sakin, and start na din pala nun yung pagbaba ng mental health ko. Sana pinansin ko na as a red flag yung late yung interviewer.

Okay naman sa simula, pero habang tumatagal napapansin mo na yung mga co-workers mo na inaabuso ka, utos doon utos diyan, kala mo sila may-ari nung company, plastikan and super toxic ng co-worker ko.

5 months lang kinaya ko. Kasi sa loob ng 5months na yan, gabi gabi ako umiiyak, gigising akong di masaya, tinatanong ko sarili ko na hanggang dito nalang ba talaga ako, deserved ko ba to, bobo ba ko. Lahat ng pwedeng maisip naisip ko na. Kaya sobrang down mental health ko nun. 

Ngayon wala padin akong work, tagal ko din di naghanap kasi inayos ko muna sarili ko. Pero ngayon naghahanap hanap ulit ako heheh. Pero habang wala pa, nagbubusiness ako ngayon.

P.S From province ako and Metro Manila ako nagwork. First time ko lumuwas that time + introvert ako kaya for me napakalaking movement sakin na lumabas ako sa comfort zone ko. Ang sad lang na ganito nanyari sakin.",16,6,0.9,Story üó£Ô∏è,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/18i2kkr/first_work_experience/,18i2kkr
