       "1  dodged a bad company and human resources i guess ive applied for one of the subsidiaries of aboitiz and id really like to share how horrible the application process or how the human resources handled it i guess was bale i just graduated from my electrical engineering degree this january and ive started to apply to a few companies including this subsidiary from aboitiz when compared to companies ive also done interviews with like pldt jg summit and smc my experience with aboitiz was very disappointing i had my expectations for aboitiz since it was known to be one of the top companies and employers in the philippines so maybe the way human resources communicate is formal and classy ​​right its not like im just communicating with someone in a lowend company who is deeply struggling in handling communications the problem here was that i was the one who was understanding and patient even though they were the ones who had lapses in handling my application three months have passed and theyve contacted me saying that my application was already being considered but it was placed on hold due to a problem with the vacancy of the position with that i just had to withdraw and say that i wasnt already comfortable with the process and how poorly they were handling my application i withdrew because maybe my application was a hassle on their end besides maybe human resources is really just waiting for me to break towards their treatmentattitude human resources replied to my withdrawal i cant put exact phrases but heres the gist human resources said the usual stuff first like were deeply sorry about the inconveniences made on your end blablabla sorry to see you go then according to the end they said i was too arty raw for complaining and that i should man up more to understand reallife problems that are being encountered in their office i shouldnt be complaining too because i am not an employee to ask for something on their end what i was just asking for was respect heres one one out of a lot inconvenience problem that happened they asked me to attend an f f interview in their office the two hour travel going to their office didnt matter because i was enjoying my stay in our province to avoid the city heat however when i arrived then waited for two hours in the lobby nobody in the division division or department where the people i met remembered that i had a scheduled interview the human resources responsible for this was called to have a meeting in another office in a different city so nobody was left in their office where i was to arrangeconduct the interview so according to the ending was that i was asked to go home instead forgave them for that because it is understandable that they might have miscommunications in the office in that case the hr still rated me   \n",
