       "5  its not my fault that i will<br>overcompensate because there are only a<br>few of us here in summary is the title<br>long story told is its annoying to come<br>in for days when im also absent and im<br>basically asking for a suspension im a<br>warehouse staff and mostly i did<br>preparation of the requested boxes last<br>wednesday im sorry that my area is clean<br>there are only a few caster boards of<br>boxes the boxes are placed in front of<br>my area when i came back on thursday<br>morning it was as if there was a storm<br>and the boxes there were exploded<br>especially in the front so it will be<br>over until sometime the head afternoon<br>came and i was met with continuous<br>requests for boxes so they piled up in<br>front including the boxes that were<br>already there the front was full i was<br>arranging the boxes when i thought i<br>heard someone call me i went out but i<br>thought the other sound of my name was<br>called so i went back inside to get<br>ready again i was called oh i see and i<br>was a little annoyed that i didnt come<br>right away i was told not to go back too<br>much and finish something first before<br>going somewhere as for other things what<br>i do is prepare the box and take it out<br>of the box g the pile will increase i<br>said that because my work has increased<br>because of the night shifts dont blame<br>me our leader reasoned that there are<br>few people even though i am from the<br>other shift and they are always bored if<br>there is nothing to do thats why the<br>boxes are piling up i just dont speak<br>anymore when im angry i speed up my<br>actions and block out all the things so<br>i cant talk i decided to go out instead<br>of being caught up with oh i see that im<br>leaving and im going to go out that i<br>seemed to be asking for an explanation<br>as to why and it was obvious that i was<br>annoyed so i said that you should sweat<br>and do laundry then i turned around to<br>go to the biometrics and they wanted me<br>to make a presentation and i was told<br>that they had even talked to me to go<br>back to my area and i painted the<br>sleeping place i saw hidden in the boxes<br>in front of my area i didnt come in on<br>friday and maybe talk to me about team<br>building this saturday but im not with<br>minove that week so these days im absent<br>im a little out of the myself because it<br>was the same when i was in my<br>stepfathers small construction company<br>and when i was doing my thesis i was so<br>tired i would overcompensate for people<br>who didnt have anything and then i would<br>be the one to blame for our rate and it<br>becomes with ot a little bit like that<br>but i dont like the movement because im<br>used to it who is always working in our<br>house because if you dont get out of<br>here thats all i can hear from my<br>stepfather and i keep looking like a<br>hero at work but now i feel guilty even<br>though i broke even once i want to quit<br>if only i wasnt tight with money now i<br>started as an oncall in september but i<br>signed a contract with them in december<br>i was given the uniform last tuesday ive<br>been waiting for months and im going to<br>get my coe and im going to start   \n",

just so people are<br>covered in case they are planning to<br>resign adding a line or two as well<br>about health concerns as a cause for<br>immediate resignations so lately ive<br>been seeing some posts on this sub about<br>what happens if you choose to go absent<br>without leave or file for immediate<br>resignation for whatever reason thought<br>of writing this simple guide for<br>everyone on the implications and next<br>steps should you decide on passing your<br>immediate resignation for whatever<br>reason first why file for immediate<br>resignation as the name implies<br>immediate resignation is the voluntary<br>resignation of an employee with<br>immediate effect however one cannot<br>simply pass their immediate resignation<br>and expect it to be valid without them<br>incurring liabilities to their employer<br>for your immediate resignation to be<br>valid your reasons must indicate just<br>causes as the labor code provides<br>actually if you have just causes you do<br>not need to submit a resignation letter<br>second what are just causes for<br>immediate resignation according to the<br>labor code these are just causes for<br>your immediate resignation serious<br>insult to the honor and person of the<br>employee inhuman and unbearable<br>treatment accorded the employee by the<br>employer or his representative crime<br>committed against the person of the<br>employee or any immediate members of the<br>employees family other similar causes<br>you have been cheated by your employer<br>you can resign immediately there are<br>libelous statements made by your<br>employer against you you can resign<br>immediately your employer locked you in<br>the office via padlock resign that job<br>you can no longer stand you have another<br>opportunity cant wait you were insulted<br>that your salary is low just wait you<br>cant resign right away give your days<br>notice first so you dont have to hang<br>anything if you dont have just cause but<br>you really cant stand it anymore and you<br>file an immediate resignation the<br>employer can consider you as absent<br>without leave which can be grounds for<br>abandonment third whats absent without<br>leave and abandonment awol as the name<br>implies its being absent from work<br>without properly filing for a leave it<br>can be just one instance or habitual<br>instances of being absent from work<br>without following company guidelines<br>abandonment a failure to report to work<br>or absence without valid or justifiable<br>reasons there must be a clear intention<br>to sever the relationship with the<br>employer different between absent<br>without leave and abandonment while<br>absent without leave is not<br>automatically abandonment since going<br>absent without leave just means that you<br>did not follow the company policy for<br>being absent it can lead to abandonment<br>if you really intend to leave your<br>employer being terminated for going<br>absent without leave is also different<br>from being terminated for abandonment<br>fyi fourth what are the implications if<br>youre tagged for abandonment okay the<br>burden to prove that you abandoned your<br>job falls on the employer however they<br>can consider you terminated if theyre<br>able to prove that you did in fact<br>abandon your post termination is not an<br>easy matter thou gh as the employer also<br>needs to do their due diligence and<br>afford you due process fifth how can an<br>employer terminate you for abandonment<br>as evidence of abandonment for an<br>employer to terminate you the employer<br>must attempt to contact you several<br>times through different mediums such as<br>your personal and work emails contact<br>number and last known physical address<br>if you do not respond to any of these<br>and it is documented by the employer the<br>next step is to formally provide you<br>with a notice to explain an<br>administrative hearing and if you still<br>do not show up your notice of<br>termination lastly what are the<br>implications if you were terminated for<br>abandonment like any other instances<br>where an employee was terminated for<br>neglect of duty or other issues like<br>harassment you do not have separation<br>pay the employer will also release your<br>and coe but your record is also not good<br>if your future potential employer<br>conducts a thorough background check<br>while your file is sealed and considered<br>confidential information by your<br>previous employer it doesnt mean that<br>the human resources of your previous<br>employer will not reveal your reasons or<br>lack thereof for leaving during a<br>background check you can opt to not<br>include the previous employer in your cv<br>when applying for a new job but again<br>your future potential employer can find<br>out about your stint in your previous<br>company when checking your sss etc<br>records there are instances as well that<br>an employer can seek damages depending<br>on your contract especially if there are<br>provisions regarding breach of contract<br>ive seen a few contracts where employers<br>stipulate damages that are worth figures<br>but this is an extreme case if you dont<br>have just causes for immediate<br>resignation best to render at least days<br>still or negotiate a shorter window with<br>your employer but what about health<br>concerns are they valid for immediate<br>resignation however this doesnt mean<br>that health reasons are strictly invalid<br>the same goes for mental health concerns<br>proper documentation is crucial note<br>that there might be a bit of negotiation<br>required here as well since not all<br>employers will be willing to bend the<br>day notice period as required by law in<br>this case proper documentation of your<br>health reasons and a plan to facilitate<br>the proper turnover and clearances will<br>be crucial here in short health reasons<br>for immediate resignation are on a<br>casetocase basis edit what are the<br>implications for a regular employee vs a<br>probationary employee okay so if you are<br>a regular employee all the provisions<br>stated above apply however if you are a<br>probationary employee and you decide to<br>resign immediately without just causes<br>here are possible scenarios that can<br>apply to you employer will still require<br>you to render days as prescribed by law<br>just so you can finish work and do your<br>proper turnover and clearances employer<br>can offer to negotiate a shorter window<br>for your notice period if theyre kind<br>lol if you are stubborn in your<br>immediate resignation without just<br>causes the employer can consider your<br>status as not regularized due to<br>abandonment meaning you did not pass the<br>probationary period as you left this<br>would still require a paper trail though<br>such as the employer trying to contact<br>you through several mediums",

and<br>told them in person instead of my<br>regular $ paycheck holiday pay included<br>i would of received on the st of may my<br>check was short over $ dollars and i<br>only received $ and it showed i only<br>worked hours not which is what i would<br>of had for this pay period because i<br>worked my schedule the whole month didnt<br>take day off i told supervisors who<br>werent really our supervisors because<br>our supervisor got fired the week before<br>this happened weird right and now weeks<br>lateri still do not have the other part<br>of my paycheck i told payroll when my<br>check came and i saw the error as well<br>but they closed my support ticket same<br>day and the supervisors that was<br>contacted did not give me an update what<br>do i do now i come to work on time clock<br>in clock out do the job the best of my<br>ability i havent taken day off and all<br>of may ive had this error why was my<br>hours shortened intentionally and why is<br>the other part of my check missing and<br>if they know this is an error they<br>havent even contacted me about giving me<br>the other part of my check i am a young<br>female and i work around id say men i am<br>a minority and i dont want to assume<br>that my race or gender had anything to<br>do with this but for the last months<br>theyve been talking behind my back my<br>leads expect me to perform when everyone<br>else gets away with they refuse to cover<br>me when i go to the bathroom but when<br>they go they go whenever they want and<br>their friends always cover them there is<br>only one guy who covers for me and he<br>isnt even from our area when i started<br>learning a lot of different work most of<br>the men there do not respect me or my<br>area and ive been physically<br>uncomfortable at times by things that<br>were said and done to me and i went to<br>human resources in the past for the<br>treatment ive been receiving from an old<br>supervisor yes a supervisor and human<br>resources did nothing about it nowadays<br>i just dont talk to anyone because<br>everyone kisses each others behind i<br>stay away from that i have social<br>anxiety but that doesnt stop me from<br>doing my job and that doesnt stop me<br>from speaking up when something happens<br>but its the lack of empathy and lack of<br>understanding that makes me never speak<br>up on what happens to me and now of all<br>thingsi have to deal with lost wages i<br>know this is a lot to try and understand<br>for an outsider looking i but i am<br>calling on help from anyone who has<br>knowledge of what this situation is and<br>the next steps i should take are ive<br>been to human resources so many times<br>payroll times talked with supervisors<br>and nothing has been done not for the<br>treatment the harassment the bullying<br>the lost wages or the missing time off<br>my check i just need help and i need the<br>money from them but they havent given me<br>anything in over weeks just to confirm<br>that they did absolutely nothing i just<br>got paid after using all of my paid time<br>off for the first time in months and i<br>got my same check but my last check was<br>short almost waaaay over half which is<br>about $ $ i cant quit and i cant speak<br>up i cant even get paid decently without<br>them screwing up something and every<br>time i bring an issue to their attention<br>they brush it off there is so much more<br>that has happened and i want to tell my<br>story but im so afraid of it sounding<br>like im ranting or complaining or making<br>this up i need to get out of this<br>specific job and elevate within the<br>company but this company has purposely<br>limited our ability to apply for other<br>positions because every thing beyond<br>being an associate requires you to have<br>a bs degree

          "a guide on immediate resignations absent<br>without leave and abandonment reposting<br>this guide that i posted on the other<br>sub figured that it might come in handy<br>for antiworkph just so people are<br>covered in case they are planning to<br>resign adding a line or two as well<br>about health concerns as a cause for<br>immediate resignations so lately ive<br>been seeing some posts on this sub about<br>what happens if you choose to go absent<br>without leave or file for immediate<br>resignation for whatever reason thought<br>of writing this simple guide for<br>everyone on the implications and next<br>steps should you decide on passing your<br>immediate resignation for whatever<br>reason first why file for immediate<br>resignation as the name implies<br>immediate resignation is the voluntary<br>resignation of an employee with<br>immediate effect however one cannot<br>simply pass their immediate resignation<br>and expect it to be valid without them<br>incurring liabilities to their employer<br>for your immediate resignation to be<br>valid your reasons must indicate just<br>causes as the labor code provides<br>actually if you have just causes you do<br>not need to submit a resignation letter<br>second what are just causes for<br>immediate resignation according to the<br>labor code these are just causes for<br>your immediate resignation serious<br>insult to the honor and person of the<br>employee inhuman and unbearable<br>treatment accorded the employee by the<br>employer or his representative crime<br>committed against the person of the<br>employee or any immediate members of the<br>employees family other similar causes<br>you have been cheated by your employer<br>you can resign immediately there are<br>libelous statements made by your<br>employer against you you can resign<br>immediately your employer locked you in<br>the office via padlock resign that job<br>you can no longer stand you have another<br>opportunity cant wait you were insulted<br>that your salary is low just wait you<br>cant resign right away give your days<br>notice first so you dont have to hang<br>anything if you dont have just cause but<br>you really cant stand it anymore and you<br>file an immediate resignation the<br>employer can consider you as absent<br>without leave which can be grounds for<br>abandonment third whats absent without<br>leave and abandonment awol as the name<br>implies its being absent from work<br>without properly filing for a leave it<br>can be just one instance or habitual<br>instances of being absent from work<br>without following company guidelines<br>abandonment a failure to report to work<br>or absence without valid or justifiable<br>reasons there must be a clear intention<br>to sever the relationship with the<br>employer different between absent<br>without leave and abandonment while<br>absent without leave is not<br>automatically abandonment since going<br>absent without leave just means that you<br>did not follow the company policy for<br>being absent it can lead to abandonment<br>if you really intend to leave your<br>employer being terminated for going<br>absent without leave is also different<br>from being terminated for abandonment<br>fyi fourth what are the implications if<br>youre tagged for abandonment okay the<br>burden to prove that you abandoned your<br>job falls on the employer however they<br>can consider you terminated if theyre<br>able to prove that you did in fact<br>abandon your post termination is not an<br>easy matter thou gh as the employer also<br>needs to do their due diligence and<br>afford you due process fifth how can an<br>employer terminate you for abandonment<br>as evidence of abandonment for an<br>employer to terminate you the employer<br>must attempt to contact you several<br>times through different mediums such as<br>your personal and work emails contact<br>number and last known physical address<br>if you do not respond to any of these<br>and it is documented by the employer the<br>next step is to formally provide you<br>with a notice to explain an<br>administrative hearing and if you still<br>do not show up your notice of<br>termination lastly what are the<br>implications if you were terminated for<br>abandonment like any other instances<br>where an employee was terminated for<br>neglect of duty or other issues like<br>harassment you do not have separation<br>pay the employer will also release your<br>and coe but your record is also not good<br>if your future potential employer<br>conducts a thorough background check<br>while your file is sealed and considered<br>confidential information by your<br>previous employer it doesnt mean that<br>the human resources of your previous<br>employer will not reveal your reasons or<br>lack thereof for leaving during a<br>background check you can opt to not<br>include the previous employer in your cv<br>when applying for a new job but again<br>your future potential employer can find<br>out about your stint in your previous<br>company when checking your sss etc<br>records there are instances as well that<br>an employer can seek damages depending<br>on your contract especially if there are<br>provisions regarding breach of contract<br>ive seen a few contracts where employers<br>stipulate damages that are worth figures<br>but this is an extreme case if you dont<br>have just causes for immediate<br>resignation best to render at least days<br>still or negotiate a shorter window with<br>your employer but what about health<br>concerns are they valid for immediate<br>resignation however this doesnt mean<br>that health reasons are strictly invalid<br>the same goes for mental health concerns<br>proper documentation is crucial note<br>that there might be a bit of negotiation<br>required here as well since not all<br>employers will be willing to bend the<br>day notice period as required by law in<br>this case proper documentation of your<br>health reasons and a plan to facilitate<br>the proper turnover and clearances will<br>be crucial here in short health reasons<br>for immediate resignation are on a<br>casetocase basis edit what are the<br>implications for a regular employee vs a<br>probationary employee okay so if you are<br>a regular employee all the provisions<br>stated above apply however if you are a<br>probationary employee and you decide to<br>resign immediately without just causes<br>here are possible scenarios that can<br>apply to you employer will still require<br>you to render days as prescribed by law<br>just so you can finish work and do your<br>proper turnover and clearances employer<br>can offer to negotiate a shorter window<br>for your notice period if theyre kind<br>lol if you are stubborn in your<br>immediate resignation without just<br>causes the employer can consider your<br>status as not regularized due to<br>abandonment meaning you did not pass the<br>probationary period as you left this<br>would still require a paper trail though<br>such as the employer trying to contact<br>you through several mediums",

that<br>were said and done to me and i went to<br>human resources in the past for the<br>treatment ive been receiving from an old<br>supervisor yes a supervisor and human<br>resources did nothing about it nowadays<br>i just dont talk to anyone because<br>everyone kisses each others behind i<br>stay away from that i have social<br>anxiety but that doesnt stop me from<br>doing my job and that doesnt stop me<br>from speaking up when something happens<br>but its the lack of empathy and lack of<br>understanding that makes me never speak<br>up on what happens to me and now of all<br>thingsi have to deal with lost wages i<br>know this is a lot to try and understand<br>for an outsider looking i but i am<br>calling on help from anyone who has<br>knowledge of what this situation is

to<br>the resignation of one of our members so<br>basically one position was dissolved<br>because they transferred the one<br>assigned to that dissolved position to<br>another role however the duties and<br>responsibilities are not dissolved based<br>on a close door discussion within some<br>of our heads it was decided to give<br>those to me without even discussing it<br>with my immediate superior to know<br>whether i can accommodate the additional<br>tasks they just informed my immediate<br>superior as an for your information<br>basis without discussing the reason why<br>they chose me to shoulder this<br>additional burden they set a meeting to<br>discuss this change at this point im<br>still clueless to the decision of adding<br>some tasks to me my immediate superior<br>talked to me one on one prior to the<br>cascade of reorganization to inform me<br>about this change of scope to my work my<br>position was that i cannot take<br>additional workload and why did they<br>think that i can handle additional<br>workload when in fact neither me nor my<br>immediate superior was consulted about<br>it the only reason they gave was the<br>other person that they considered was<br>already full what happened that day was<br>the heads had a premeeting prior the<br>discussion with us my immediate superior<br>raised my concern in that premeeting so<br>what transpired was they parked the<br>discussion of my added roles for another<br>day they asked to prepare a tms to check<br>whether i can accommodate the additional<br>tasks my concern is that despite my tms<br>showing that i cannot accommodate<br>additional tasks knowing our senior head<br>they can position it that they have the<br>full right to change my work load and<br>not cooperating would merit willfull<br>insubordination we will be having a<br>discussion tomorrow and will i have<br>strong legal support if i refuse to<br>accept the additional tasks to add there<br>are other personnel that they choose but<br>it seemed that they are insistent into<br>me taking the additional roles as they<br>dont asked other members to do tms after<br>they made aware of my stand that i<br>cannot accommodate additional task<br>hoping someone can help me will highly<br>appreciate if you can aldo help in<br>providing specific legal provisions and<br>actual case study as i was not able to<br>find any similar case nor legal<br>provision on the basis of refusal to<br>take additional responsibility update<br>just to update everyone who read my<br>complaint i already found another job<br>with higher position and compensation so<br>its like a blessing in disguise thats<br>also the case since i was forced to seek<br>a job outside my current one and that<br>made it even better as for the events<br>related to my post what i found out was<br>that thats why the approach of our new<br>head internally promoted because he felt<br>that i was underloaded his reasoning why<br>he wants me to overload when they asked<br>me to cover for someone i managed to do<br>cover that person so with him i have a<br>lot of idle time to be able to do that<br>he said im not too much felt in the<br>section that he was handling to be fair<br>my immediate superior and one of the lt<br>defended me outright that his<br>conclusions were not true they also gave<br>me feedback on what happened in their lt<br>meetings so i am aware of what is being<br>discussed about me to clarify the his<br>issues are issues i was able to cover<br>because i work at home and in workends i<br>am still working to cover whatever i<br>didnt do because there is an urgent need<br>to do like cover other employees and<br>besides this is work related why is he<br>not questioning other employees able to<br>attend coffee and gossip sessions bday<br>bash nonwork related extra curricular<br>activities issue the problem is that im<br>not reporting to him so all my<br>activities are reported to my immediate<br>superior later i found out that during<br>editing of the monthly reports the<br>former my boss updated me since he was a<br>detailed update that the top management<br>doesnt need much since they only present<br>company metrics and their group monthly<br>meeting was stopped in which he was<br>normally discussed lastly for the past<br>yrs he didnt raise any issues about my<br>output so why now had he raised this<br>earlier we could have made an alignment<br>of expectations so they formalized the<br>additional role no adjustment in<br>compensation but through the help of my<br>immediate superior we managed to<br>convince the top management to spread<br>out the responsibilities to others other<br>people but at this point im just buying<br>my time to secure another job by the way<br>my immediate superior knows my plans to<br>resign even if the situation is fine<br>since its the values ​​of the next<br>department head my concern i dont want<br>to be in constant battle with the<br>department head just because he has been<br>prejudiced against me recently since his<br>plan to overload me the first time did<br>not succeed he devised a new scheme to<br>overload me again which failed again its<br>just a rumor another suspicion of ours<br>however two of his issues are because my<br>salary is higher than his colleagues who<br>have the same position as me i am an<br>external hire because i know that all<br>external hires somehow or another have<br>issues or are pressured to take more<br>responsibilities not even explicitly<br>discussing with them what he expected<br>like the former because our salary is<br>high he needs to see us doing well at<br>work is there a lesson that should be<br>learned im not sure but here are the<br>things i realized by actually making<br>good connections i managed to land a<br>better job faster through the help of my<br>former superior not expecting that in<br>less than a month i will immediately<br>find someone to move to know your worth<br>if the management cant see that look<br>somewhere that can see your worth we<br>dont deserve to be in a constant battle<br>within our own department the<br>interaction with outside the department<br>is already stressful so dont add it if<br>you dont want to change work know how to<br>kiss a$s because im not chummy with our<br>new manager so im suddenly one of the<br>hot

           "the story of the person who resigned<br>took the place of the person who<br>resigned and lost his job bow im going<br>to rant right away but im going to go<br>through the story so that the person who<br>resigned has a thrill but his last day<br>in january was really meant for cutoff<br>for full salary backpay but prior to<br>that his replacement has arrived january<br>thats why he resigned of course you know<br>the drill hes turning over here because<br>he replaced him hes a veteran who<br>resigned so its surprising that hes<br>leaving after more than a decade with<br>the company but even though he has a lot<br>of unfinished tasks or pending tasks<br>that have reached a year because there<br>is already something in his turnover<br>files its a bit annoying because in his<br>time he got to the point where he didnt<br>really pay attention to the replacement<br>of the one who resigned by the way the<br>pending tasks referred to by the person<br>who resigned are money for the person<br>who replaced the person who resigned i<br>know it was explained to him but i dont<br>know if i talked to the person who<br>replaced the person who resigned we had<br>a coffee break we talked i gave tips i<br>told the cons at work but its really<br>very shallow and for him its nothing hes<br>used to feeling it basically he doesnt<br>really feel the cons that i said based<br>on his answers in the story time passes<br>of course as taught by the resigned took<br>the place of the one who resigned we<br>hear and see how he teaches its really<br>okay even manager boss and colleagues<br>which is us we ask him that if he has<br>questions and concerns dont be shy<br>because our brains are not closed<br>knowing the one who resigned and pending<br>tasks the one who resigned by tuesday is<br>gone because he was only there until<br>january thats why the one who replaced<br>the one who resigned is a real job but<br>this is the plot twist he took the place<br>of the one who resigned by thursday rd<br>day since the one who resigned suddenly<br>handed in his resignation i was very<br>annoyed because a lot was wasted and he<br>bothered me a lot each department<br>assistant head oriented him of course<br>those managers ate too much time to<br>orient which i should know because i<br>experienced how they orient which is<br>really okay and then suddenly left you<br>know whats annoying is that he still had<br>a lot of problems when i was still<br>talking to him and then we found out<br>that he demanded another job he wanted<br>the job of one of his contemporaries who<br>is new if they can be replaced you cant<br>even prove anything but if you can<br>demand from the you want it to be your<br>job you envy him because the one at the<br>same time as him is not doing much but<br>because there are no tasks there and<br>there is no income either basically i am<br>talking incentives and commission here<br>thats why i said he is lucky if after<br>all he is like the fresh graduates that<br>the demanding has not yet been proven<br>resigned immediately anxious this is how<br>it is so this is friday january our<br>managers are very angry they are already<br>ransacking the area because of the<br>disturbance he caused its a bunch of<br>pending tasks and he gave up because he<br>had a few questions for him because<br>thats how it is with new people and our<br>boss is very open to concerns because i<br>felt him when i was new its friday<br>january and the shocking twist is that<br>the new employee will no longer be<br>accepted as a replacement for the one<br>who resigned and took the place of the<br>one who resigned thats why the pending<br>task of the two of them was divided<br>among their colleagues and i was among<br>the ones who lost their jobs the problem<br>is because he doesnt have a proper<br>turnover imagine he is still adapting to<br>take over from the one who resigned<br>obviously he hasnt done much yet in fact<br>he didnt get what he was taught nor did<br>he resign we only found out on thursday<br>thats why he resigned because he didnt<br>get it either all of a sudden all of a<br>sudden on friday he pmed us with pending<br>tasks so i almost didnt have a coffee<br>break because of the inquiries he<br>suddenly passed my contact details and<br>voila one after the other he didnt even<br>have an explanation of what we were<br>going to do with the pending as long as<br>he emailed which is we dont understand<br>as long as he is a table of details of<br>his pending task but you cant understand<br>anything from the remarks because its<br>either blank or just some random<br>information that has no indication of<br>what it is whats my rant ruined my<br>weekends are supposed to be gone now i<br>should be but because of course i worked<br>all day on my rest day from when i woke<br>up this morning until this morning when<br>i typed this i still havent done it<br>which is annoying considering that we<br>are in the planning stage because its<br>january suddenly like this",

           "lack of trainings here in the<br>philippines little rant i dont know if<br>this happens as often in other more<br>advanced countries as often as it<br>happens here in the philippines but<br>companies here managed by older filipino<br>managers majority of the time does not<br>impose trainings and they expect you to<br>perform just as good as the other<br>employees who had been working there for<br>years just a short story for further<br>context had my first job complete noob<br>and my manager expected me to perform<br>well i didnt even though i have good<br>credentials after graduating college cum<br>praise it would not be enough to<br>surmount that huge knowledge gap from<br>the company but he kept bringing my<br>credentials up to me whenever he thinks<br>i am underperforming it would have been<br>great if there was a manual or<br>guidelines explaining how and why these<br>processes are done or why are they there<br>in the first place it would have been<br>much easier than asking someone else for<br>help i found out later in my experience<br>that companies must have these manuals<br>guidelines and other things explaining<br>their processes so that when no<br>personcoworker is capable of assisting<br>you you can manage it by yourself been<br>with the company for six months and made<br>major achievements for the company such<br>as reduction of reject and wasted<br>materials up to consistently during my<br>probationary period and improve output<br>to oee to not excellent numbers really<br>but good enough the impact is felt<br>throughout the company but the manager<br>takes all the credit yet he considers me<br>underperforming because he sees that<br>that was his achievement not mine he<br>never gave me the raises nor promotion<br>that was necessary he just basked in the<br>limelight all the while squeezing me<br>every bit of output from me quit<br>resigned and the company fell down a<br>very deep hole as it turned out<br>allocations of budget had already been<br>set in stone since the owner is seeing<br>that we are capable of maintaining those<br>numbers during my time however after my<br>resignation those numbers can no longer<br>be met and thus making the company lose<br>more money than it ever should since<br>they moved on to take projects they can<br>not meet and constantly being penalized<br>for not achieving the required numbers<br>managers ego is very big he does not<br>want the owner to know that what kept<br>him above the water is because of his<br>good employees all those experienced and<br>good employees resigned and he was left<br>with new employees never invested on<br>them nor gave them proper care he just<br>squeezed numbers from them numbers could<br>have been met if the manager is not too<br>repulsive and he actually invested in<br>his key employees nah bro he invested<br>only on his solutions that does not work<br>mind you these project charters he had<br>been providing has no data nor basis for<br>it he just believes it works well it<br>doesnt sucks for him my third job same<br>thing and the fourth one is a different<br>story my fourth job is a very big<br>company everything there is free<br>including dorm rent and food exceptions<br>only to hygienic products the company as<br>a whole is great however the department<br>i was in is not news of high attrition<br>rate and abuse not being addressed is<br>extremely prevalent in that department<br>human resources is not doing anything to<br>resolve that issue in that department<br>since procurement manager and human<br>resources manager are helping each other<br>out there had been very talented and<br>experienced employees that had been with<br>the department and all of them wasted by<br>this manager i am not as skilled as<br>anyone who left the company before me<br>however i have very specific skills that<br>keeps me at an advantage to them thats<br>why they kept me in that company problem<br>is i am new to that department and dont<br>know all the processes involved much<br>more the idiosyncrasies of the workplace<br>no training done nor skim through of the<br>processes no manuals nor guidelines and<br>certainly no assistance from tenured<br>employees employees there are also toxic<br>had to do it on my own luckily i program<br>stuff so workload that should take a<br>tenured employee to do for hours only<br>takes me minutes but problem is even<br>though i can finish workload fast there<br>are things i cant do other departments<br>really like me since i was the only one<br>who took the position who can manage the<br>workload i can do it since i have made<br>work automatic but the manager i dont<br>know what his problem is always scolds<br>me problems which are very vague i ask<br>him to clarify what is actually the<br>problem he gave reasons that does not<br>make sense from wrong formats which does<br>not really matter since the files i used<br>are only for tracking things and<br>automating stuffs they never are<br>submitted he just sees what i do<br>whenever he goes to my spot and not<br>following the chronological order of<br>doing stuff that chronological order<br>does not really matter as well well<br>customers call you at different times of<br>the day owner sees the improvement in<br>only two months from our department<br>specifically from the task that i had<br>been working on and added me to the<br>group in which the owner is also present<br>managers attitude and aggression towards<br>me heightened even further and drove me<br>to resignation funnily enough he keeps<br>adding me to groupchats so that the<br>owner sees that i am still in the<br>company currently in a new company with<br>training problem is the president who is<br>japanese caught wind of the culture of<br>his company since they do not implement<br>trainings this pissed off the president<br>and mandated clearly that rules set on<br>the manuals must be followed however the<br>culture of the company remained<br>coworkers kept telling me nasty stuff<br>like i was so blessed jokingly back then<br>they endured things without trainings<br>nor assistance boastfully even to go as<br>far as say that they are better than me<br>if they had trainings heres what i<br>observed assistance from coworkers are<br>great in fact better than reading a book<br>or manual in my experience there are<br>very few sometimes they are not from my<br>department who assists me however<br>manuals and guidelines are better in a<br>few aspects since they do not get busy<br>nor toxic sometimes you meet the person<br>whom you need assistance from a specific<br>task but would rather not divulge info<br>because they do not like you or their<br>ego is being stepped on next filipino<br>managers majority not all does not<br>really know how to do their jobs well<br>but this is more prevalent with older<br>managers than younger ones if there are<br>older managers who can do this well i<br>have never met one i have only met<br>younger managers who really do their<br>jobs well the purpose of the post is to<br>inform some and also to discuss what<br>best practices are possible to improve<br>employee performance especially new<br>hires and this is also a rant currently<br>i am working with no standards nor<br>formats so i usually report with my own<br>format scolded a few times because they<br>do not like how it looked or formatted<br>asked them how to improve they only gave<br>vague answers like this is too big this<br>is too small etc there should be numbers<br>not descriptions like how big how small<br>etc next communication this is the first<br>time i have been in a company where<br>influx of information is not well<br>circulated monitorings of data which you<br>need are not saved in a single drive<br>where accessible nor being divulged not<br>because there is a policy about<br>divulging info but because some people<br>just dont want to divulge it to you i<br>really dont knowwhat their gimmick is<br>since i asked why they are not giving it<br>easily i got a reply of you should learn<br>to get the data from the production<br>itself bro it is not in my job<br>description to monitor your shit that<br>your job monitoring of that data also<br>takes days not just in a single day<br>although there are trackers to keep<br>things documented that is the only time<br>the policy of divulging info is<br>disallowed since it is not my job to<br>communicate to that department about the<br>monitorings they literally tell me that<br>there are only specific named personnel<br>to which they can share those info any<br>story you can share as well regarding<br>this and how you addressed them",

          "refusal to accept additional work ive<br>been searching the web for any<br>information regarding my current<br>predicament recently my department was<br>forced to have a reorganization due to<br>the resignation of one of our members so<br>basically one position was dissolved<br>because they transferred the one<br>assigned to that dissolved position to<br>another role however the duties and<br>responsibilities are not dissolved based<br>on a close door discussion within some<br>of our heads it was decided to give<br>those to me without even discussing it<br>with my immediate superior to know<br>whether i can accommodate the additional<br>tasks they just informed my immediate<br>superior as an for your information<br>basis without discussing the reason why<br>they chose me to shoulder this<br>additional burden they set a meeting to<br>discuss this change at this point im<br>still clueless to the decision of adding<br>some tasks to me my immediate superior<br>talked to me one on one prior to the<br>cascade of reorganization to inform me<br>about this change of scope to my work my<br>position was that i cannot take<br>additional workload and why did they<br>think that i can handle additional<br>workload when in fact neither me nor my<br>immediate superior was consulted about<br>it the only reason they gave was the<br>other person that they considered was<br>already full what happened that day was<br>the heads had a premeeting prior the<br>discussion with us my immediate superior<br>raised my concern in that premeeting so<br>what transpired was they parked the<br>discussion of my added roles for another<br>day they asked to prepare a tms to check<br>whether i can accommodate the additional<br>tasks my concern is that despite my tms<br>showing that i cannot accommodate<br>additional tasks knowing our senior head<br>they can position it that they have the<br>full right to change my work load and<br>not cooperating would merit willfull<br>insubordination we will be having a<br>discussion tomorrow and will i have<br>strong legal support if i refuse to<br>accept the additional tasks to add there<br>are other personnel that they choose but<br>it seemed that they are insistent into<br>me taking the additional roles as they<br>dont asked other members to do tms after<br>they made aware of my stand that i<br>cannot accommodate additional task<br>hoping someone can help me will highly<br>appreciate if you can aldo help in<br>providing specific legal provisions and<br>actual case study as i was not able to<br>find any similar case nor legal<br>provision on the basis of refusal to<br>take additional responsibility update<br>just to update everyone who read my<br>complaint i already found another job<br>with higher position and compensation so<br>its like a blessing in disguise thats<br>also the case since i was forced to seek<br>a job outside my current one and that<br>made it even better as for the events<br>related to my post what i found out was<br>that thats why the approach of our new<br>head internally promoted because he felt<br>that i was underloaded his reasoning why<br>he wants me to overload when they asked<br>me to cover for someone i managed to do<br>cover that person so with him i have a<br>lot of idle time to be able to do that<br>he said im not too much felt in the<br>section that he was handling to be fair<br>my immediate superior and one of the lt<br>defended me outright that his<br>conclusions were not true they also gave<br>me feedback on what happened in their lt<br>meetings so i am aware of what is being<br>discussed about me to clarify the his<br>issues are issues i was able to cover<br>because i work at home and in workends i<br>am still working to cover whatever i<br>didnt do because there is an urgent need<br>to do like cover other employees and<br>besides this is work related why is he<br>not questioning other employees able to<br>attend coffee and gossip sessions bday<br>bash nonwork related extra curricular<br>activities issue the problem is that im<br>not reporting to him so all my<br>activities are reported to my immediate<br>superior later i found out that during<br>editing of the monthly reports the<br>former my boss updated me since he was a<br>detailed update that the top management<br>doesnt need much since they only present<br>company metrics and their group monthly<br>meeting was stopped in which he was<br>normally discussed lastly for the past<br>yrs he didnt raise any issues about my<br>output so why now had he raised this<br>earlier we could have made an alignment<br>of expectations so they formalized the<br>additional role no adjustment in<br>compensation but through the help of my<br>immediate superior we managed to<br>convince the top management to spread<br>out the responsibilities to others other<br>people but at this point im just buying<br>my time to secure another job by the way<br>my immediate superior knows my plans to<br>resign even if the situation is fine<br>since its the values ​​of the next<br>department head my concern i dont want<br>to be in constant battle with the<br>department head just because he has been<br>prejudiced against me recently since his<br>plan to overload me the first time did<br>not succeed he devised a new scheme to<br>overload me again which failed again its<br>just a rumor another suspicion of ours<br>however two of his issues are because my<br>salary is higher than his colleagues who<br>have the same position as me i am an<br>external hire because i know that all<br>external hires somehow or another have<br>issues or are pressured to take more<br>responsibilities not even explicitly<br>discussing with them what he expected<br>like the former because our salary is<br>high he needs to see us doing well at<br>work is there a lesson that should be<br>learned im not sure but here are the<br>things i realized by actually making<br>good connections i managed to land a<br>better job faster through the help of my<br>former superior not expecting that in<br>less than a month i will immediately<br>find someone to move to know your worth<br>if the management cant see that look<br>somewhere that can see your worth we<br>dont deserve to be in a constant battle<br>within our own department the<br>interaction with outside the department<br>is already stressful so dont add it if<br>you dont want to change work know how to<br>kiss a$s because im not chummy with our<br>new manager so im suddenly one of the<br>hot ones",

          "the story of the person who resigned<br>took the place of the person who<br>resigned and lost his job bow im going<br>to rant right away but im going to go<br>through the story so that the person who<br>resigned has a thrill but his last day<br>in january was really meant for cutoff<br>for full salary backpay but prior to<br>that his replacement has arrived january<br>thats why he resigned of course you know<br>the drill hes turning over here because<br>he replaced him hes a veteran who<br>resigned so its surprising that hes<br>leaving after more than a decade with<br>the company but even though he has a lot<br>of unfinished tasks or pending tasks<br>that have reached a year because there<br>is already something in his turnover<br>files its a bit annoying because in his<br>time he got to the point where he didnt<br>really pay attention to the replacement<br>of the one who resigned by the way the<br>pending tasks referred to by the person<br>who resigned are money for the person<br>who replaced the person who resigned i<br>know it was explained to him but i dont<br>know if i talked to the person who<br>replaced the person who resigned we had<br>a coffee break we talked i gave tips i<br>told the cons at work but its really<br>very shallow and for him its nothing hes<br>used to feeling it basically he doesnt<br>really feel the cons that i said based<br>on his answers in the story time passes<br>of course as taught by the resigned took<br>the place of the one who resigned we<br>hear and see how he teaches its really<br>okay even manager boss and colleagues<br>which is us we ask him that if he has<br>questions and concerns dont be shy<br>because our brains are not closed<br>knowing the one who resigned and pending<br>tasks the one who resigned by tuesday is<br>gone because he was only there until<br>january thats why the one who replaced<br>the one who resigned is a real job but<br>this is the plot twist he took the place<br>of the one who resigned by thursday rd<br>day since the one who resigned suddenly<br>handed in his resignation i was very<br>annoyed because a lot was wasted and he<br>bothered me a lot each department<br>assistant head oriented him of course<br>those managers ate too much time to<br>orient which i should know because i<br>experienced how they orient which is<br>really okay and then suddenly left you<br>know whats annoying is that he still had<br>a lot of problems when i was still<br>talking to him and then we found out<br>that he demanded another job he wanted<br>the job of one of his contemporaries who<br>is new if they can be replaced you cant<br>even prove anything but if you can<br>demand from the you want it to be your<br>job you envy him because the one at the<br>same time as him is not doing much but<br>because there are no tasks there and<br>there is no income either basically i am<br>talking incentives and commission here<br>thats why i said he is lucky if after<br>all he is like the fresh graduates that<br>the demanding has not yet been proven<br>resigned immediately anxious this is how<br>it is so this is friday january our<br>managers are very angry they are already<br>ransacking the area because of the<br>disturbance he caused its a bunch of<br>pending tasks and he gave up because he<br>had a few questions for him because<br>thats how it is with new people and our<br>boss is very open to concerns because i<br>felt him when i was new its friday<br>january and the shocking twist is that<br>the new employee will no longer be<br>accepted as a replacement for the one<br>who resigned and took the place of the<br>one who resigned thats why the pending<br>task of the two of them was divided<br>among their colleagues and i was among<br>the ones who lost their jobs the problem<br>is because he doesnt have a proper<br>turnover imagine he is still adapting to<br>take over from the one who resigned<br>obviously he hasnt done much yet in fact<br>he didnt get what he was taught nor did<br>he resign we only found out on thursday<br>thats why he resigned because he didnt<br>get it either all of a sudden all of a<br>sudden on friday he pmed us with pending<br>tasks so i almost didnt have a coffee<br>break because of the inquiries he<br>suddenly passed my contact details and<br>voila one after the other he didnt even<br>have an explanation of what we were<br>going to do with the pending as long as<br>he emailed which is we dont understand<br>as long as he is a table of details of<br>his pending task but you cant understand<br>anything from the remarks because its<br>either blank or just some random<br>information that has no indication of<br>what it is whats my rant ruined my<br>weekends are supposed to be gone now i<br>should be but because of course i worked<br>all day on my rest day from when i woke<br>up this morning until this morning when<br>i typed this i still havent done it<br>which is annoying

but<br>companies here managed by older filipino<br>managers majority of the time does not<br>impose trainings and they expect you to<br>perform just as good as the other<br>employees who had been working there for<br>years just a short story for further<br>context had my first job complete noob<br>and my manager expected me to perform<br>well i didnt even though i have good<br>credentials after graduating college cum<br>praise it would not be enough to<br>surmount that huge knowledge gap from<br>the company but he kept bringing my<br>credentials up to me whenever he thinks<br>i am underperforming it would have been<br>great if there was a manual or<br>guidelines explaining how and why these<br>processes are done or why are they there<br>in the first place it would have been<br>much easier than asking someone else for<br>help i found out later in my experience<br>that companies must have these manuals<br>guidelines and other things explaining<br>their processes so that when no<br>personcoworker is capable of assisting<br>you you can manage it by yourself been<br>with the company for six months and made<br>major achievements for the company such<br>as reduction of reject and wasted<br>materials up to consistently during my<br>probationary period and improve output<br>to oee to not excellent numbers really<br>but good enough the impact is felt<br>throughout the company but the manager<br>takes all the credit yet he considers me<br>underperforming because he sees that<br>that was his achievement not mine he<br>never gave me the raises nor promotion<br>that was necessary he just basked in the<br>limelight all the while squeezing me<br>every bit of output from me quit<br>resigned and the company fell down a<br>very deep hole as it turned out<br>allocations of budget had already been<br>set in stone since the owner is seeing<br>that we are capable of maintaining those<br>numbers during my time however after my<br>resignation those numbers can no longer<br>be met and thus making the company lose<br>more money than it ever should since<br>they moved on to take projects they can<br>not meet and constantly being penalized<br>for not achieving the required numbers<br>managers ego is very big he does not<br>want the owner to know that what kept<br>him above the water is because of his<br>good employees all those experienced and<br>good employees resigned and he was left<br>with new employees never invested on<br>them nor gave them proper care he just<br>squeezed numbers from them numbers could<br>have been met if the manager is not too<br>repulsive and he actually invested in<br>his key employees nah bro he invested<br>only on his solutions that does not work<br>mind you these project charters he had<br>been providing has no data nor basis for<br>it he just believes it works well it<br>doesnt sucks for him my third job same<br>thing and the fourth one is a different<br>story my fourth job is a very big<br>company everything there is free<br>including dorm rent and food exceptions<br>only to hygienic products the company as<br>a whole is great however the department<br>i was in is not news of high attrition<br>rate and abuse not being addressed is<br>extremely prevalent in that department<br>human resources is not doing anything to<br>resolve that issue in that department<br>since procurement manager and human<br>resources manager are helping each other<br>out there had been very talented and<br>experienced employees that had been with<br>the department and all of them wasted by<br>this manager i am not as skilled as<br>anyone who left the company before me<br>however i have very specific skills that<br>keeps me at an advantage to them thats<br>why they kept me in that company problem<br>is i am new to that department and dont<br>know all the processes involved much<br>more the idiosyncrasies of the workplace<br>no training done nor skim through of the<br>processes no manuals nor guidelines and<br>certainly no assistance from tenured<br>employees employees there are also toxic<br>had to do it on my own luckily i program<br>stuff so workload that should take a<br>tenured employee to do for hours only<br>takes me minutes but problem is even<br>though i can finish workload fast there<br>are things i cant do other departments<br>really like me since i was the only one<br>who took the position who can manage the<br>workload i can do it since i have made<br>work automatic but the manager i dont<br>know what his problem is always scolds<br>me problems which are very vague i ask<br>him to clarify what is actually the<br>problem he gave reasons that does not<br>make sense from wrong formats which does<br>not really matter since the files i used<br>are only for tracking things and<br>automating stuffs they never are<br>submitted he just sees what i do<br>whenever he goes to my spot and not<br>following the chronological order of<br>doing stuff that chronological order<br>does not really matter as well well<br>customers call you at different times of<br>the day owner sees the improvement in<br>only two months from our department<br>specifically from the task that i had<br>been working on and added me to the<br>group in which the owner is also present<br>managers attitude and aggression towards<br>me heightened even further and drove me<br>to resignation funnily enough he keeps<br>adding me to groupchats so that the<br>owner sees that i am still in the<br>company currently in a new company with<br>training problem is the president who is<br>japanese caught wind of the culture of<br>his company since they do not implement<br>trainings this pissed off the president<br>and mandated clearly that rules set on<br>the manuals must be followed however the<br>culture of the company remained<br>coworkers kept telling me nasty stuff<br>like i was so blessed jokingly back then<br>they endured things without trainings<br>nor assistance boastfully even to go as<br>far as say that they are better than me<br>if they had trainings heres what i<br>observed assistance from coworkers are<br>great in fact better than reading a book<br>or manual in my experience there are<br>very few sometimes they are not from my<br>department who assists me however<br>manuals and guidelines are better in a<br>few aspects since they do not get busy<br>nor toxic sometimes you meet the person<br>whom you need assistance from a specific<br>task but would rather not divulge info<br>because they do not like you or their<br>ego is being stepped on next filipino<br>managers majority not all does not<br>really know how to do their jobs well<br>but this is more prevalent with older<br>managers than younger ones if there are<br>older managers who can do this well i<br>have never met one i have only met<br>younger managers who really do their<br>jobs well the purpose of the post is to<br>inform some and also to discuss what<br>best practices are possible to improve<br>employee performance especially new<br>hires and this is also a rant currently<br>i am working with no standards nor<br>formats so i usually report with my own<br>format scolded a few times because they<br>do not like how it looked or formatted<br>asked them how to improve they only gave<br>vague answers like this is too big this<br>is too small etc there should be numbers<br>not descriptions like how big how small<br>etc next communication this is the first<br>time i have been in a company where<br>influx of information is not well<br>circulated monitorings of data which you<br>need are not saved in a single drive<br>where accessible nor being divulged not<br>because there is a policy about<br>divulging info but because some people<br>just dont want to divulge it to you i<br>really dont knowwhat their gimmick is<br>since i asked why they are not giving it<br>easily i got a reply of you should learn<br>to get the data from the production<br>itself bro it is not in my job<br>description to monitor your shit that<br>your job monitoring of that data also<br>takes days not just in a single day<br>although there are trackers to keep<br>things documented that is the only time<br>the policy of divulging info is<br>disallowed since it is not my job to<br>communicate to that department about the<br>monitorings they literally tell me that<br>there are only specific named personnel<br>to which they can share those info any<br>story you can share as well regarding<br>this and how you addressed them",

time was am i was<br>there and exactly am i was spoken to by<br>the guard and stayed in their meeting<br>room ill be honest their building is not<br>good its old because the aura of the<br>place is like a place that can be used<br>for shooting horror films the only good<br>thing is the coldness of their air<br>conditioner after a few minutes their<br>human resources came and took me through<br>assessments and i filled out some forms<br>in the exam as well if i remember<br>correctly when i got to nn he had lunch<br>with me first then he just summarized<br>the exam by pm this afternoon because<br>the person who will be interviewing me<br>which is the human resources head will<br>pm me later as usual take note that the<br>human resources head is the son of the<br>owner of the company so it is<br>understandable that he is late for work<br>is that really the case when the owners<br>son or you are the owner you have the<br>authority to be late i said to myself i<br>can only wait for one hour and i dont<br>want to go back its a waste of time<br>because of the fare of human resources<br>there is still nothing of course and i<br>have already invested an hour of waiting<br>i still waited i was updated when human<br>resources again said that the human<br>resources head would be late but he<br>informed me that there is an interview<br>scheduled but still nothing its just<br>then that human resources decided to do<br>an initial interview with me thats fine<br>we talked about it the annoying thing is<br>that he immediately said that my asking<br>salary was not in their budget thats why<br>i actually went to the company to see if<br>the offer to me is bigger compared to a<br>company that has already given me a job<br>offer it doesnt matter that human<br>resources found out that the salary was<br>a big factor in my decision i hope they<br>didnt wait for me to be interviewed by<br>their human resources head im so patient<br>to the point that i look like a fool i<br>waited for hours i told myself thats the<br>last time if theres no one ill go home<br>but when i should have gone home im<br>probably going to regret it then i was<br>called for an interview by a human their<br>resources head so i went and he said he<br>likes me because he says im serious<br>about the job because i waited a long<br>time so i smile smile ahahaha even<br>though i want to hit him he still<br>insists that he likes me too because<br>they say i am committed because they say<br>i will be the breadwinner of the fa im<br>sorry for the point that he said that im<br>sure im sure im sure i dont want to work<br>with them as a piglet the eldest son and<br>a freshgrad thats the way he thinks im<br>going to make him decide too much so i<br>wont mention the other things we talked<br>about but the bottom line he said that<br>my asking salary is too much and this is<br>all they can give him he said that i<br>should wait a few minutes and he will<br>get back to me he said that he will<br>interview me because his sister who is<br>the chief executive officer of their<br>company is a fool as for me it was only<br>a few minutes ago that one of their<br>employees informed me that they said to<br>wait a few minutes because the ceo pu is<br>still eating and i couldnt take it<br>anymore i will come back if they agree<br>to what i said the employee said that he<br>informed the ceo after a few minutes<br>someone came into the room to interview<br>me he is part of the board of directors<br>but he is not the ceo that interview was<br>just used to buy time it seems like he<br>only asked me two questions and he<br>already told me i dont need that he told<br>me about his life and how difficult the<br>position i am applying for is something<br>he experienced because thats all it is<br>it took minutes for him to lecture i<br>just said yes because i have to be<br>polite hahaha even though i really<br>wanted to go home because they said then<br>the minutes passed and the human<br>resources head came to inform me of the<br>news that i was really busy did they<br>tell me that they were already occupied<br>they say that the position im applying<br>for is someone with at least years of<br>experience i wish they had told me from<br>the beginning so that i didnt waste my<br>whole day with them they said that their<br>chief executive officer convinced me<br>that it was good for me but thats not<br>the job i want the human resources head<br>also mentioned that im a good fit<br>because im especially patient and his<br>sister is a perfectionist thats it and<br>stole it no thank you i dont want to be<br>exploited and shout loudly the ending i<br>didnt get anything i came home to us<br>mages pm more than anything almost human<br>resources were eaten for nothing im<br>still really pissed off every time i<br>remember my cursed but i hope they go<br>bankrupt or i hope they dont always have<br>good food its annoying because this<br>update is pm the human resources head of<br>the company reached out to me inviting<br>me again for an interview in december<br>whats more annoying to receive from me<br>no response at all or i will reject<br>saying

hear me out this post is<br>too long i hopped on a quick call<br>yesterday when i said quick call it was<br>insanely fast a grillgrinding interview<br>​ so my scheduled time was am<br>philippines time i woke up at around and<br>proceeded to set everything up from my<br>laptop to the lighting ​ at around i<br>joined the zoom link and entered the pin<br>boom it was all black i mean i didnt<br>turn my camera on lol so i checked the<br>link directly and yes it was all correct<br>at am s joined in which means i joined<br>first and she came in next she said good<br>morning and thank you for hopping on<br>this preliminary interview with hikinex<br>im the executive hiring specialist ill<br>be shadowing this preliminary interview<br>a talent specialist will join us as well<br>​ yes you read it right hikinex sounds<br>like highly intelligent knowledge right<br>laughing out loud but i had some<br>research on my sleeve i did my company<br>research which i think makes me more<br>highly intelligent than them lol ​ after<br>a while j came in the talent specialist<br>and greeted us they asked my consent to<br>record the zoom meeting which i gave<br>then j asked me​ can you briefly tell me<br>more about yourself ​ i answered ​ ​ how<br>do you create seo content ​ this<br>question got me thinking ​ so i answered<br>​ well i usually follow a certain<br>checklist to create content whether its<br>about an seo article or writing<br>seofriendly articles to briefly walk you<br>through i need to ask my clients for the<br>content brief from there i draw lines on<br>what needs to be done and what needs to<br>be accomplished first like keyword<br>research and of course after everything<br>is written i need to get my clients<br>approval plus i put that on the system<br>that my client intends me to use one<br>example is wordpress she then answered<br>alright ​ ​ what made you apply for this<br>role as a marketing content writer ​<br>actually before i answer that let me<br>shed light on this so youd know where im<br>coming from and we could meet in between<br>i never optedin applying for the<br>position i received a message from andy<br>jiminez your cofounding chief executive<br>officer on linkedin and he invited me<br>for a quick call which i religiously<br>accepted so it piqued my interest to<br>attend this quick call and i never<br>expected that its going to be a panel of<br>interviews pardon my line of answering ​<br>i mean we just need to be friendly calm<br>and jive here right ​ we proceeded to<br>the next question ​ can you walk me<br>through how you write content ​ ​ the<br>last question is ​ how much salary do<br>you expect from us ​ that depends<br>actually because i need to use certain<br>parameters like the length of time and<br>work rendered fulltime and parttime and<br>from that i can draw a ballpark figure<br>around k pesos per month ​ but hear me<br>out ​ as a freelance copywriter the<br>value and conversions i bring to the<br>table are three times greater than my<br>monthly salary ​ say one article costs $<br>and one case study project costs $ which<br>is what i expect however please do not<br>worry as this is merely my expectation<br>ultimately i am focused on<br>implementation and action j she seemed<br>content with my response and asked if i<br>had any questions to which i<br>respectfully obliged thank you j<br>actually i have three questions two for<br>you and one for s is that okay sure<br>firstly what is the unique selling<br>proposition of hikinex thanks next what<br>values ​​can you impart to me as an<br>aspiring candidate for the marketing<br>content writing position ​ she answered<br>and explained doing her best to provide<br>comprehensive responses ​ which i<br>completely understand i replied ​ she<br>then exclaimed oh p you really put me on<br>hot sit there ​ its alright i noticed<br>that you were doing your best and i<br>appreciate it j ​ thank you j ​ let me<br>now ask s a question ​ as the executive<br>recruiter of hikinex how do you counter<br>negative social proof comments and<br>reviews online + suspension notices<br>about your company ​ simply put we<br>ignore them as long as they do not<br>impact us also to answer your previous<br>question about the values ​​we impart to<br>aspiring candidates just be yourself we<br>do not micromanage ​ i understand s<br>thanks for that ​ i then delivered my<br>sales closing message thanking them for<br>taking the call with me and wishing them<br>luck with their future recruitment<br>activity ​ they said that they would<br>provide feedback within the week after<br>forwarding the recording to the hiring<br>manager ​ side note i started with an<br>end in mind ​ as a freelancer let us<br>avoid the mindset that we are business<br>employees we are business partners which<br>makes a significant difference whatever<br>the results may be i will not proceed<br>with the hiring process because i<br>noticed some red flags there are plenty<br>of them but i will not list them down ps<br>this is my personal experience so<br>exercise your own diligence if you wish<br>to work with them what do you think guys<br>did i grillgrind them laughing out loud",

in the background as<br>the recruiter by the way this is a<br>longpost thus the prelude introduction<br>ive been seeing a lot of posts about<br>being ghosted by a recruiter be it they<br>didnt call back after signing a job<br>offer no calls after the<br>technicalorinitial interview or worst no<br>call at all yes i know it sucks to be<br>treated that way i personally been in<br>your situation when starting my career<br>and even during my early job hopping<br>experience guess what i didnt dwell on<br>it nor asked what company is it for me<br>to avoid it i applied and they were even<br>the ones chasing me yes the people<br>company you hated were the ones chasing<br>me so whats the difference between you<br>and me and please all of these are<br>hypothetical so if it hits you and you<br>get triggered sleep on it first so youd<br>comprehend why does ghosting happen when<br>you apply what happens is that a<br>recruiter will read your cv then check<br>on available job posts for a crossmatch<br>even if you did it yourself they might<br>reach out and call you to get some<br>details so its up to you what you can<br>disclose basically your profile gets<br>deprioritized and simply put rejected i<br>know and completely understand you want<br>to hear the rejection from them but if<br>you received a failed response and your<br>peers with identical skill sets as you<br>knew they wont apply there anymore so<br>why is your profile getting<br>deprioritized theres only one reason why<br>theres someone better than you or better<br>put theres someone else who can do the<br>job without much training needed despite<br>the salary requirements now you would<br>tell me i need a job and i cant build<br>that experience without a job so how can<br>i compete you upskill yourself its today<br>and most skill literature is shared on<br>youtube tiktok etc so instead of mopping<br>around you got rejected or coping with<br>the rejection by playing games and being<br>unproductive by the way just gives more<br>reason not to hire you you need to<br>discipline yourself to match the job<br>youre the one asking for the job right<br>so know whats needed to get the job my<br>personal experience as an applicant when<br>i started this is my personal experience<br>when i started looking for a job nope<br>not the present when most jobs cant<br>afford to hire me ive applied to a<br>hundred jobs or basically run a shotgun<br>to what jobs are available with the<br>keyword java of the only initially<br>interviewed me then only proceeded to a<br>technical interview and only made a job<br>offer as for the postings who ghosted me<br>i didnt care to ask why oh i did<br>experience a dry spell wherein all<br>applications turned interviews whats the<br>reason for giving me the offer it was<br>simply i was the right man for the job<br>and ironically i was one ghosting those<br>job offers why for the same reason i<br>deprioritized th em all for a company<br>that values ​​my skills and career<br>growth my personal experience as a<br>recruiter ive been a recruiter for years<br>been an it programmer for years before<br>retiring so handling + cvs a day while<br>meeting the target key performance<br>indices and only having hours to scheme<br>them all just imagine how many cvs are<br>left unread and ghosted look am not<br>proud of it even am sharing it see the<br>picture and yes when i got the chance to<br>catch up there are good applicants that<br>id missed as they already have taken a<br>job add in my hourly limit as a<br>recruiter for just hours a week as i<br>need to run hours on the main job its<br>hard to read all cvs and interview them<br>which by the way takes hours for a<br>skills interview you get the picture my<br>proposal to combat ghosting since am i<br>became a parttime recruiter and a<br>programmer i programmed an application<br>tracking system or hris for that agency<br>yes we still encode the data and all but<br>all recruiters were able to keep a track<br>of all applicants and whats their status<br>we even sent an email notification only<br>for rejection but the best part we get<br>scolded by the hiring manager because he<br>gets notified that this applicant has<br>been left in the for initial interview<br>after days did that help in my<br>perspective yes then again not all<br>recruitment agency has the same budget<br>for one nor have a centralized way to<br>storeupdate applicant status how should<br>you cope the answer is simple you submit<br>your application but dont expect a reply<br>treat your application as done and<br>rejected i know thats kinda doing<br>reverse psychology to yourself but it<br>helps change your mindset from chasing<br>the company to letting the company chase<br>you and the same applies to every step<br>of your application and what if there is<br>no one interviewing you then you need to<br>upskill ive said it before your current<br>skills arent a match or better yet<br>theres someone better than you and more<br>qualified so start investing in your<br>skills how to deal with<br>recruiterscompanies who are known to a<br>ghosts actually nothing just hit apply<br>like you didnt apply and if they called<br>you good but dont expect any again this<br>is the let them chase you mindset and<br>not you chasing the company why need to<br>change your mindset its simple to value<br>your worth and am going to touch a bit<br>about lowballing most applicants who get<br>a verbal offer intuitively accept the<br>offer before reviewing it and when they<br>post here to review they get dumbfounded<br>that its a low salary for that position<br>and it pains to see their excited faces<br>turn to frustration thats you chasing<br>the company mindset now if you start the<br>let the company chase you and they gave<br>you an offer below your accepting rate<br>you can decline youd be surprised that<br>there will be offers that will give in<br>to your asking salary considering you<br>really are worth the rate and with the<br>prices going up due to inflation and all<br>well now you know",

          "recruitment process that took hours long<br>post ahead irritated your sister ahaha i<br>went to the companys office for<br>interview and preemployment assessment<br>yesterday my scheduled time was am i was<br>there and exactly am i was spoken to by<br>the guard and stayed in their meeting<br>room ill be honest their building is not<br>good its old because the aura of the<br>place is like a place that can be used<br>for shooting horror films the only good<br>thing is the coldness of their air<br>conditioner after a few minutes their<br>human resources came and took me through<br>assessments and i filled out some forms<br>in the exam as well if i remember<br>correctly when i got to nn he had lunch<br>with me first then he just summarized<br>the exam by pm this afternoon because<br>the person who will be interviewing me<br>which is the human resources head will<br>pm me later as usual take note that the<br>human resources head is the son of the<br>owner of the company so it is<br>understandable that he is late for work<br>is that really the case when the owners<br>son or you are the owner you have the<br>authority to be late i said to myself i<br>can only wait for one hour and i dont<br>want to go back its a waste of time<br>because of the fare of human resources<br>there is still nothing of course and i<br>have already invested an hour of waiting<br>i still waited i was updated when human<br>resources again said that the human<br>resources head would be late but he<br>informed me that there is an interview<br>scheduled but still nothing its just<br>then that human resources decided to do<br>an initial interview with me thats fine<br>we talked about it the annoying thing is<br>that he immediately said that my asking<br>salary was not in their budget thats why<br>i actually went to the company to see if<br>the offer to me is bigger compared to a<br>company that has already given me a job<br>offer it doesnt matter that human<br>resources found out that the salary was<br>a big factor in my decision i hope they<br>didnt wait for me to be interviewed by<br>their human resources head im so patient<br>to the point that i look like a fool i<br>waited for hours i told myself thats the<br>last time if theres no one ill go home<br>but when i should have gone home im<br>probably going to regret it then i was<br>called for an interview by a human their<br>resources head so i went and he said he<br>likes me because he says im serious<br>about the job because i waited a long<br>time so i smile smile ahahaha even<br>though i want to hit him he still<br>insists that he likes me too because<br>they say i am committed because they say<br>i will be the breadwinner of the fa im<br>sorry for the point that he said that im<br>sure im sure im sure i dont want to work<br>with them as a piglet the eldest son and<br>a freshgrad thats the way he thinks im<br>going to make him decide too much so i<br>wont mention the other things we talked<br>about but the bottom line he said that<br>my asking salary is too much and this is<br>all they can give him he said that i<br>should wait a few minutes and he will<br>get back to me he said that he will<br>interview me because his sister who is<br>the chief executive officer of their<br>company is a fool as for me it was only<br>a few minutes ago that one of their<br>employees informed me that they said to<br>wait a few minutes because the ceo pu is<br>still eating and i couldnt take it<br>anymore i will come back if they agree<br>to what i said the employee said that he<br>informed the ceo after a few minutes<br>someone came into the room to interview<br>me he is part of the board of directors<br>but he is not the ceo that interview was<br>just used to buy time it seems like he<br>only asked me two questions and he<br>already told me i dont need that he told<br>me about his life and how difficult the<br>position i am applying for is something<br>he experienced because thats all it is<br>it took minutes for him to lecture i<br>just said yes because i have to be<br>polite hahaha even though i really<br>wanted to go home because they said then<br>the minutes passed and the human<br>resources head came to inform me of the<br>news that i was really busy did they<br>tell me that they were already occupied<br>they say that the position im applying<br>for is someone with at least years of<br>experience i wish they had told me from<br>the beginning so that i didnt waste my<br>whole day with them they said that their<br>chief executive officer convinced me<br>that it was good for me but thats not<br>the job i want the human resources head<br>also mentioned that im a good fit<br>because im especially patient and his<br>sister is a perfectionist thats it and<br>stole it no thank you i dont want to be<br>exploited and shout loudly the ending i<br>didnt get anything i came home to us<br>mages pm more than anything almost human<br>resources were eaten for nothing im<br>still really pissed off every time i<br>remember my cursed but i hope they go<br>bankrupt or i hope they dont always have<br>good food its annoying because this<br>update is pm the human resources head of<br>the company reached out to me inviting<br>me again for an interview in december<br>whats more annoying to receive from me<br>no response at all or i will reject<br>saying

          "hikinex company i know this is personal<br>but i think you can learn a thing or two<br>from my experience when the quick call<br>became a grillgrinding interview sounds<br>smoky right but hear me out this post is<br>too long i hopped on a quick call<br>yesterday when i said quick call it was<br>insanely fast a grillgrinding interview<br>​ so my scheduled time was am<br>philippines time i woke up at around and<br>proceeded to set everything up from my<br>laptop to the lighting ​ at around i<br>joined the zoom link and entered the pin<br>boom it was all black i mean i didnt<br>turn my camera on lol so i checked the<br>link directly and yes it was all correct<br>at am s joined in which means i joined<br>first and she came in next she said good<br>morning and thank you for hopping on<br>this preliminary interview with hikinex<br>im the executive hiring specialist ill<br>be shadowing this preliminary interview<br>a talent specialist will join us as well<br>​ yes you read it right hikinex sounds<br>like highly intelligent knowledge right<br>laughing out loud but i had some<br>research on my sleeve i did my company<br>research which i think makes me more<br>highly intelligent than them lol ​ after<br>a while j came in the talent specialist<br>and greeted us they asked my consent to<br>record the zoom meeting which i gave<br>then j asked me​ can you briefly tell me<br>more about yourself ​ i answered ​ ​ how<br>do you create seo content ​ this<br>question got me thinking ​ so i answered<br>​ well i usually follow a certain<br>checklist to create content whether its<br>about an seo article or writing<br>seofriendly articles to briefly walk you<br>through i need to ask my clients for the<br>content brief from there i draw lines on<br>what needs to be done and what needs to<br>be accomplished first like keyword<br>research and of course after everything<br>is written i need to get my clients<br>approval plus i put that on the system<br>that my client intends me to use one<br>example is wordpress she then answered<br>alright ​ ​ what made you apply for this<br>role as a marketing content writer ​<br>actually before i answer that let me<br>shed light on this so youd know where im<br>coming from and we could meet in between<br>i never optedin applying for the<br>position i received a message from andy<br>jiminez your cofounding chief executive<br>officer on linkedin and he invited me<br>for a quick call which i religiously<br>accepted so it piqued my interest to<br>attend this quick call and i never<br>expected that its going to be a panel of<br>interviews pardon my line of answering ​<br>i mean we just need to be friendly calm<br>and jive here right ​ we proceeded to<br>the next question ​ can you walk me<br>through how you write content ​ ​ the<br>last question is ​ how much salary do<br>you expect from us ​ that depends<br>actually because i need to use certain<br>parameters like the length of time and<br>work rendered fulltime and parttime and<br>from that i can draw a ballpark figure<br>around k pesos per month ​ but hear me<br>out ​ as a freelance copywriter the<br>value and conversions i bring to the<br>table are three times greater than my<br>monthly salary ​ say one article costs $<br>and one case study project costs $ which<br>is what i expect however please do not<br>worry as this is merely my expectation<br>ultimately i am focused on<br>implementation and action j she seemed<br>content with my response and asked if i<br>had any questions to which i<br>respectfully obliged thank you j<br>actually i have three questions two for<br>you and one for s is that okay sure<br>firstly what is the unique selling<br>proposition of hikinex thanks next what<br>values ​​can you impart to me as an<br>aspiring candidate for the marketing<br>content writing position ​ she answered<br>and explained doing her best to provide<br>comprehensive responses ​ which i<br>completely understand i replied ​ she<br>then exclaimed oh p you really put me on<br>hot sit there ​ its alright i noticed<br>that you were doing your best and i<br>appreciate it j ​ thank you j ​ let me<br>now ask s a question ​ as the executive<br>recruiter of hikinex how do you counter<br>negative social proof comments and<br>reviews online + suspension notices<br>about your company ​ simply put we<br>ignore them as long as they do not<br>impact us also to answer your previous<br>question about the values ​​we impart to<br>aspiring candidates just be yourself we<br>do not micromanage ​ i understand s<br>thanks for that ​ i then delivered my<br>sales closing message thanking them for<br>taking the call with me and wishing them<br>luck with their future recruitment<br>activity ​ they said that they would<br>provide feedback within the week after<br>forwarding the recording to the hiring<br>manager ​ side note i started with an<br>end in mind ​ as a freelancer let us<br>avoid the mindset that we are business<br>employees we are business partners which<br>makes a significant difference whatever<br>the results may be i will not proceed<br>with the hiring process because i<br>noticed some red flags there are plenty<br>of them but i will not list them down ps<br>this is my personal experience so<br>exercise your own diligence if you wish<br>to work with them what do you think guys<br>did i

          "ghosting why it happens and how to cope<br>prelude before anything else please<br>gather some confidence to read this ill<br>tell you i cant help myself not filter<br>what really happens in the background as<br>the recruiter by the way this is a<br>longpost thus the prelude introduction<br>ive been seeing a lot of posts about<br>being ghosted by a recruiter be it they<br>didnt call back after signing a job<br>offer no calls after the<br>technicalorinitial interview or worst no<br>call at all yes i know it sucks to be<br>treated that way i personally been in<br>your situation when starting my career<br>and even during my early job hopping<br>experience guess what i didnt dwell on<br>it nor asked what company is it for me<br>to avoid it i applied and they were even<br>the ones chasing me yes the people<br>company you hated were the ones chasing<br>me so whats the difference between you<br>and me and please all of these are<br>hypothetical so if it hits you and you<br>get triggered sleep on it first so youd<br>comprehend why does ghosting happen when<br>you apply what happens is that a<br>recruiter will read your cv then check<br>on available job posts for a crossmatch<br>even if you did it yourself they might<br>reach out and call you to get some<br>details so its up to you what you can<br>disclose basically your profile gets<br>deprioritized and simply put rejected i<br>know and completely understand you want<br>to hear the rejection from them but if<br>you received a failed response and your<br>peers with identical skill sets as you<br>knew they wont apply there anymore so<br>why is your profile getting<br>deprioritized theres only one reason why<br>theres someone better than you or better<br>put theres someone else who can do the<br>job without much training needed despite<br>the salary requirements now you would<br>tell me i need a job and i cant build<br>that experience without a job so how can<br>i compete you upskill yourself its today<br>and most skill literature is shared on<br>youtube tiktok etc so instead of mopping<br>around you got rejected or coping with<br>the rejection by playing games and being<br>unproductive by the way just gives more<br>reason not to hire you you need to<br>discipline yourself to match the job<br>youre the one asking for the job right<br>so know whats needed to get the job my<br>personal experience as an applicant when<br>i started this is my personal experience<br>when i started looking for a job nope<br>not the present when most jobs cant<br>afford to hire me ive applied to a<br>hundred jobs or basically run a shotgun<br>to what jobs are available with the<br>keyword java of the only initially<br>interviewed me then only proceeded to a<br>technical interview and only made a job<br>offer as for the postings who ghosted me<br>i didnt care to ask why oh i did<br>experience a dry spell wherein all<br>applications turned interviews whats the<br>reason for giving me the offer it was<br>simply i was the right man for the job<br>and ironically i was one ghosting those<br>job offers why for the same reason i<br>deprioritized th em all for a company<br>that values ​​my skills and career<br>growth my personal experience as a<br>recruiter ive been a recruiter for years<br>been an it programmer for years before<br>retiring so handling + cvs a day while<br>meeting the target key performance<br>indices and only having hours to scheme<br>them all just imagine how many cvs are<br>left unread and ghosted look am not<br>proud of it even am sharing it see the<br>picture and yes when i got the chance to<br>catch up there are good applicants that<br>id missed as they already have taken a<br>job add in my hourly limit as a<br>recruiter for just hours a week as i<br>need to run hours on the main job its<br>hard to read all cvs and interview them<br>which by the way takes hours for a<br>skills interview you get the picture my<br>proposal to combat ghosting since am i<br>became a parttime recruiter and a<br>programmer i programmed an application<br>tracking system or hris for that agency<br>yes we still encode the data and all but<br>all recruiters were able to keep a track<br>of all applicants and whats their status<br>we even sent an email notification only<br>for rejection but the best part we get<br>scolded by the hiring manager because he<br>gets notified that this applicant has<br>been left in the for initial interview<br>after days did that help in my<br>perspective yes then again not all<br>recruitment agency has the same budget<br>for one nor have a centralized way to<br>storeupdate applicant status how should<br>you cope the answer is simple you submit<br>your application but dont expect a reply<br>treat your application as done and<br>rejected i know thats kinda doing<br>reverse psychology to yourself but it<br>helps change your mindset from chasing<br>the company to letting the company chase<br>you and the same applies to every step<br>of your application and what if there is<br>no one interviewing you then you need to<br>upskill ive said it before your current<br>skills arent a match or better yet<br>theres someone better than you and more<br>qualified so start investing in your<br>skills how to deal with<br>recruiterscompanies who are known to a<br>ghosts actually nothing just hit apply<br>like you didnt apply and if they called<br>you good but dont expect any again this<br>is the let them chase you mindset and<br>not you chasing the company why need to<br>change your mindset its simple to value<br>your worth and am going to touch a bit<br>about lowballing most applicants who get<br>a verbal offer intuitively accept the<br>offer before reviewing it and when they<br>post here to review they get dumbfounded<br>that its a low salary for that position<br>and it pains to see their excited faces<br>turn to frustration thats you chasing<br>the company mindset now if you start the<br>let the company chase you and they gave<br>you an offer below your accepting rate<br>you can decline youd be surprised that<br>there will be offers that will give in<br>to your asking salary considering you<br>really are worth the rate and with the<br>prices going up due to inflation and all<br>well now you know",

supporting a lot of<br>clients theyre too many i lost count out<br>of employees decided to leave because<br>they dump a shit ton of workload on us<br>without giving us a chance to negotiate<br>because we need to keep our partners<br>happy managers would file insane<br>incident reports on us for not complying<br>to the deadline employees had pips at<br>one point because of it a lot of ics<br>work beyond working hours without pay am<br>pm schedule because according to our<br>contract overtime pay is invalid in a<br>work from home set up so during covid no<br>one had any overtime pays there was no<br>consideration even when some of my<br>colleagues timed out at am which was<br>seen by all employees a manager was<br>shocked that his overworked ic was<br>denied regularization because apparently<br>this executive director bitch decided to<br>weigh in evals from other managers<br>without informing him we are not paid<br>properly even though we were promoted we<br>had one colleague who was promoted from<br>junior to senior ic with only an<br>appraisal of k in our quarterly evals we<br>have this team engagement shit criterion<br>that bears a significant amount of<br>weight this is based on our engagement<br>during fun meetings where we only play<br>jackbox despite our workload theyll give<br>us low scores here when we are not<br>favorite no consideration to their<br>employees especially if theyre trying to<br>reach a deadline we had this colleague<br>who was sick and had to take a weeklong<br>leave when he came back ed almost filed<br>an incident report for loss of profit<br>because they had to find a freelance<br>resource to do his work oa and feeling<br>teenagers si ed she would yell in public<br>fake laugh and make up stories to try to<br>make us laugh hes just stupid hes cute<br>when hes like that they have an<br>offensive sense of humor at times theyre<br>very fond of body shaming we had another<br>colleague who caught covid and<br>eventually recovered without any fi cial<br>support from the company when he came<br>back human resources announced that sss<br>i forgot the gov agency can cover<br>expenses for covid recovery this<br>colleague asked human resources and the<br>chief executive officer in front of all<br>of us if hes qualified to get one even<br>though he has already recovered to which<br>they answered no and fucking laughed at<br>his face saying you are poor ed would<br>backstab a former employee who worked<br>poorly during his time in the company<br>and would constantly make him the butt<br>of the joke of every single thing that<br>she thinks was funny imagine being a<br>fucking joke to a whole company its a<br>lot but thats just the tip of the<br>iceberg no one came forward to<br>department of labor and employment<br>despite a lot of us talking about it we<br>feared that if we do so itll lessen the<br>chance of finding a new job heck a lot<br>of us badly needed work that time so<br>fast forward they recruited a lot of<br>people to fill in the vacancies most of<br>them are fresh graduates or just got out<br>of their first job theyve also fully<br>rtod and theyve been posting stories on<br>their company ig account whenever they<br>have a fun thing going on ok so this is<br>the chika eds new directive for the<br>companys social media is to show how<br>happy they are as a family to spite<br>those who left a lot of former employees<br>including me are still mutuals with that<br>account thats why she thought of doing<br>it very immature shes for gods sake i<br>dont care how they are doing right now<br>in terms of fun but i unfollowed them<br>because i keep seeing the eds face i<br>just wanna throw up this is still shes<br>keeps on making fun of some former<br>employees like what she did to the<br>formerformer one is disrespectful when<br>speaking she really thinks shes so<br>fucking funny i may not be one of them<br>but i feel so bad for them though to be<br>fair current employees do not like her<br>at all they feel the same way we did<br>when we were still employed there so i<br>also met chika they are currently making<br>plans and finding a new job before they<br>could submit their resignation this ad<br>agencys never gonna be better if they<br>keep being like that im not sure if<br>other companies behave the same way but<br>if you want to gain loyalty and<br>productivity from your employees please<br>see your employees as humans thats all<br>we ask for tldr ed is trying to make us<br>former employees regret leaving the<br>company by posting stories on their<br>company ig of how happy they are as a<br>family truth is the company is<br>disgusting as fuck in terms of employee<br>treatment thats why a lot of us had to<br>leave as well as the current

listen to me here<br>my background is fresh graduate with no<br>prior experience to sales and business<br>to business relation and right now im<br>handling a product for a year already<br>with zero sales i am the second person<br>to handle this product and ever since<br>this product was acquired by our company<br>it has never got any closed deal or<br>income for the company imagine that long<br>and to give you more insight into my<br>situation it is not the type of product<br>that is a super necessity in an industry<br>it was just an upgrade for an existing<br>market i am under a lot of pressure<br>since some of the consumables of the<br>equipment i am selling will be soon<br>expiring in the middle of this year as<br>well as the license to sell it here in<br>the philippines dont get me wrong i have<br>done a lot on my part to sell joining<br>tradeshowsexhibits cold calling lead<br>generation offering it with zero down<br>payment with months installment package<br>my boss is asking if i can go directly<br>to the companies so i can meet my<br>clients personally since when i pitch<br>the lead to our salespeople who have a<br>car they dont prioritize it because they<br>know that nothing like this has been<br>sold yet and it is not a super necessity<br>kaso my boss didnt allow me to do so<br>since i dont have a car yet and for me<br>to establish a relationship he said i<br>need to visit them constantly therefore<br>it would mean that i would commute alone<br>to every entity that i have a lead which<br>is very tiring and costly on my part i<br>was able to conduct effective and<br>strategic product presentations and<br>demos with comparative slides with<br>clients current set up using other<br>alternatives and how theyre better when<br>they acquire our machine yet after<br>presenting it to the client the usual<br>responses would be he is not our<br>priority yet we actually dont need it<br>since we are currently using this<br>alternative we do not have a budget for<br>that we have other priorities maybe we<br>will try to pitch it to our bosses next<br>year for purchase our business would<br>still function without your equipment on<br>it therefore it isnt really a necessity<br>and some would also think that i am just<br>selling a useless product i feel so<br>degrading as a professional that while i<br>am presenting to clients i can see that<br>my customers are laughing at me<br>whispering mostly saying is its not that<br>his product is so essential the pain is<br>honestly that i did everything i could<br>to study the machine and grind it during<br>the product presentation then just<br>whispering and laughing while doing the<br>product presentation i think maybe i did<br>something wrong while presenting you<br>know the audiences view that its just<br>trying to sell me a machine thats not<br>that important yet also my target market<br>were so busy and they were also a bit<br>difficult to talk to because they were<br>in a restricted area some of our<br>salespeople were also handing the<br>brochure of the product that i handled<br>and then just handing it back to them<br>saying that we dont need it to be honest<br>i feel so frustrated and hopeless about<br>it it feels like i am pouring in a<br>broken cup all my tiredness and effort<br>is wasted for nothing this is my first<br>experience of working in this industry<br>and i dont know what to do with my<br>product that cant be sold a little bit<br>im going to resign because im under too<br>much pressure and theres too much pain<br>in my chest there are still times after<br>the presentation when i want to cry<br>because i feel like theyre not that<br>interested in what im presenting you<br>know that feeling when youre excited to<br>tell a story and then the person youre<br>talking to just laughs at you and seems<br>uninterested thats how hard it is how i<br>wish i was assigned to fast moving goods<br>the pain is also that every time my boss<br>sees us or is with me during a meeting<br>with sales he always brings up that im a<br>failure when it comes to selling this<br>product and hes ashamed me to my<br>colleagues and especially to my boss<br>because the zero sales reflect who i am<br>eh i take full responsibility of the<br>situation to the point that sometimes i<br>feel like im not doing anything right<br>anymore im tired of getting it over and<br>over again i will contact a lead set a<br>schedule present then just laugh while<br>presenting i will just whisper then<br>after the presentation i will say sorry<br>because he is not our priority right now<br>i think maybe i just lack strategy or<br>proper sales training and handling<br>negotiation as well as how to add<br>urgency to presentation even if i want<br>to resign i dont want to look like a<br>failure by leaving my boss and the<br>company that they didnt get anything<br>from all the training and salary they<br>invested in me so as long as i can i<br>will find a way to close at least one<br>deal im stuck with what i feel in fact<br>im tired but i dont want to give up<br>because its embarrassing for her and i<br>also dont want to leave the company as a<br>failure because im not a quitter im<br>having a hard time selling so i hope<br>youll be kind to those you call agents<br>who are just studying we stay awake and<br>work hard for the products we present we<br>also have families to support so i hope<br>you will respect us when we present not<br>all agents just want to sell and then<br>leave you in the air when after sales<br>the others are really willing to help<br>you your current problem and ready to<br>assist until after sales thank you if<br>you reach here i just want to release my<br>frustrations with my work because i<br>really dont know who to tell this to im<br>stuck with the pressure of my boss and<br>the pressure that nothing has been sold<br>and if you have any advice for my<br>situation thank you i would really<br>appreciate it",

for loss of profit<br>because they had to find a freelance<br>resource to do his work oa and feeling<br>teenagers si ed she would yell in public<br>fake laugh and make up stories to try to<br>make us laugh hes just stupid hes cute<br>when hes like that they have an<br>offensive sense of humor at times theyre<br>very fond of body shaming we had another<br>colleague who caught covid and<br>eventually recovered without any fi cial<br>support from the company when he came<br>back human resources announced that sss<br>i forgot the gov agency can cover<br>expenses for covid recovery this<br>colleague asked human resources and the<br>chief executive officer in front of all<br>of us if hes qualified to get one even<br>though he has already recovered to which<br>they answered no and fucking laughed at<br>his face saying you are poor ed would<br>backstab a former employee who worked<br>poorly during his time in the company<br>and would constantly make him the butt<br>of the joke of every single thing that<br>she thinks was funny imagine being a<br>fucking joke to a whole company its a<br>lot but thats just the tip of the<br>iceberg no one came forward to<br>department of labor and employment<br>despite a lot of us talking about it we<br>feared that if we do so itll lessen the<br>chance of finding a new job heck a lot<br>of us badly needed work that time so<br>fast forward they recruited a lot of<br>people to fill in the vacancies most of<br>them are fresh graduates or just got out<br>of their first job theyve also fully<br>rtod and theyve been posting stories on<br>their company ig account whenever they<br>have a fun thing going on ok so this is<br>the chika eds new directive for the<br>companys social media is to show how<br>happy they are as a family to spite<br>those who left a lot of former employees<br>including me are still mutuals with that<br>account thats why she thought of doing<br>it very immature shes for gods sake i<br>dont care how they are doing right now<br>in terms of fun but i unfollowed them<br>because i keep seeing the eds face i<br>just wanna throw up this is still shes<br>keeps on making fun of some former<br>employees like what she did to the<br>formerformer one is disrespectful when<br>speaking she really thinks shes so<br>fucking funny i may not be one of them<br>but i feel so bad for them though to be<br>fair current employees do not like her<br>at all they feel the same way we did<br>when we were still employed there so i<br>also met chika they are currently making<br>plans and finding a new job before they<br>could submit their resignation this ad<br>agencys never gonna be better if they<br>keep being like that im not sure if<br>other companies behave the same way but<br>if you want to gain loyalty and<br>productivity from your employees please<br>see your employees as humans thats all<br>we ask for tldr ed is trying to make us<br>former employees regret leaving the<br>company by posting stories on their<br>company ig of how happy they are as a<br>family truth is the company is<br>disgusting as fuck in terms of employee<br>treatment thats why a lot of us had to<br>leave as well as the current

          "im tired of selling a product that no<br>one has bought yet i just want to<br>release my thoughts and ask for advice<br>here its a bit long so thank you very<br>much to those who will listen to me here<br>my background is fresh graduate with no<br>prior experience to sales and business<br>to business relation and right now im<br>handling a product for a year already<br>with zero sales i am the second person<br>to handle this product and ever since<br>this product was acquired by our company<br>it has never got any closed deal or<br>income for the company imagine that long<br>and to give you more insight into my<br>situation it is not the type of product<br>that is a super necessity in an industry<br>it was just an upgrade for an existing<br>market i am under a lot of pressure<br>since some of the consumables of the<br>equipment i am selling will be soon<br>expiring in the middle of this year as<br>well as the license to sell it here in<br>the philippines dont get me wrong i have<br>done a lot on my part to sell joining<br>tradeshowsexhibits cold calling lead<br>generation offering it with zero down<br>payment with months installment package<br>my boss is asking if i can go directly<br>to the companies so i can meet my<br>clients personally since when i pitch<br>the lead to our salespeople who have a<br>car they dont prioritize it because they<br>know that nothing like this has been<br>sold yet and it is not a super necessity<br>kaso my boss didnt allow me to do so<br>since i dont have a car yet and for me<br>to establish a relationship he said i<br>need to visit them constantly therefore<br>it would mean that i would commute alone<br>to every entity that i have a lead which<br>is very tiring and costly on my part i<br>was able to conduct effective and<br>strategic product presentations and<br>demos with comparative slides with<br>clients current set up using other<br>alternatives and how theyre better when<br>they acquire our machine yet after<br>presenting it to the client the usual<br>responses would be he is not our<br>priority yet we actually dont need it<br>since we are currently using this<br>alternative we do not have a budget for<br>that we have other priorities maybe we<br>will try to pitch it to our bosses next<br>year for purchase our business would<br>still function without your equipment on<br>it therefore it isnt really a necessity<br>and some would also think that i am just<br>selling a useless product i feel so<br>degrading as a professional that while i<br>am presenting to clients i can see that<br>my customers are laughing at me<br>whispering mostly saying is its not that<br>his product is so essential the pain is<br>honestly that i did everything i could<br>to study the machine and grind it during<br>the product presentation then just<br>whispering and laughing while doing the<br>product presentation i think maybe i did<br>something wrong while presenting you<br>know the audiences view that its just<br>trying to sell me a machine thats not<br>that important yet also my target market<br>were so busy and they were also a bit<br>difficult to talk to because they were<br>in a restricted area some of our<br>salespeople were also handing the<br>brochure of the product that i handled<br>and then just handing it back to them<br>saying that we dont need it to be honest<br>i feel so frustrated and hopeless about<br>it it feels like i am pouring in a<br>broken cup all my tiredness and effort<br>is wasted for nothing this is my first<br>experience of working in this industry<br>and i dont know what to do with my<br>product that cant be sold a little bit<br>im going to resign because im under too<br>much pressure and theres too much pain<br>in my chest there are still times after<br>the presentation when i want to cry<br>because i feel like theyre not that<br>interested in what im presenting you<br>know that feeling when youre excited to<br>tell a story and then the person youre<br>talking to just laughs at you and seems<br>uninterested thats how hard it is how i<br>wish i was assigned to fast moving goods<br>the pain is also that every time my boss<br>sees us or is with me during a meeting<br>with sales he always brings up that im a<br>failure when it comes to selling this<br>product and hes ashamed me to my<br>colleagues and especially to my boss<br>because the zero sales reflect who i am<br>eh i take full responsibility of the<br>situation to the point that sometimes i<br>feel like im not doing anything right<br>anymore im tired of getting it over and<br>over again i will contact a lead set a<br>schedule present then just laugh while<br>presenting i will just whisper then<br>after the presentation i will say sorry<br>because he is not our priority right now<br>i think maybe i just lack strategy or<br>proper sales training and handling<br>negotiation as well as how to add<br>urgency to presentation even if i want<br>to resign i dont want to look like a<br>failure by leaving my boss and the<br>company that they didnt get anything<br>from all the training and salary they<br>invested in me so as long as i can i<br>will find a way to close at least one<br>deal im stuck with what i feel in fact<br>im tired but i dont want to give up<br>because its embarrassing for her and i<br>also dont want to leave the company as a<br>failure because im not a quitter im<br>having a hard time selling so i hope<br>youll be kind to those you call agents<br>who are just studying we stay awake and<br>work hard for the products we present we<br>also have families to support so i hope<br>you will respect us when we present not<br>all agents just want to sell and then<br>leave you in the air when after sales<br>the others are really willing to help<br>you your current problem and ready to<br>assist until after sales thank you if<br>you reach here i just want to release my<br>frustrations with my work because i<br>really dont know who to tell this to im<br>stuck with the pressure of my boss and<br>the pressure that nothing has been sold<br>and if you have any advice for my<br>situation thank you i would really<br>appreciate

on pip for not being<br>culturally fit in our office the reason<br>i rocked the ex human resources<br>representative just a context about me<br>im one of the youngest members of the<br>company and the gap between us and our<br>older coworkers is at least years<br>basically my coworkers are all in their<br>early to mid our company is small but<br>this isnt my first company but this is<br>one of the first companies where i felt<br>very comfortable with the work and<br>environment were very lean also in our<br>company for the philippines we are all a<br>team it all started when i developed a<br>friendship with one of the managers from<br>a different department now we dont<br>exactly work in the same department so<br>work has nothing to do with how we<br>became friends it just turned out one<br>day that she liked hanging out with me<br>and we listen to a lot of similar music<br>we got even closer when i offered to<br>help her get tickets to one concert she<br>wanted to go do bad but she conflicted<br>with a worktrip i had the connections<br>and i didnt bother so i secured them for<br>her and she was thankful ever since then<br>wed get into conversations about<br>concerts music fests travel the like is<br>just because i escape from all the<br>stresses of work thats also the reason<br>why i work hard to be able to afford<br>those now comes the trouble my close<br>friend m in the office is also best<br>friends with the human resources<br>representative of the company he is<br>those who enter and they go way back<br>even being co workers in a previous job<br>once before our company now before i<br>would even feel like im intruding in<br>their friendship when close friend would<br>ask me to go with them both to buy<br>office supplies or run errands for the<br>company during weekends again im a<br>homebody and going out sometimes would<br>do my mental health good the dynamic is<br>okay in the first case i just noticed<br>that it seems like a close friend gets<br>treated badly by human resources<br>representative me minding my own<br>business kept that observation to myself<br>because at the end of the day i dont<br>have a say in their friendship if time<br>is the basis they are probably tighter<br>than me and my close friend because<br>theyve been friends for longer but that<br>doesnt really mean anything to me months<br>into my employment at the company i also<br>found one of my close friends lets name<br>her b needing work and im the type to<br>help out whenever i can so i put in a<br>good work and thankfully b got in take<br>note around this time we are still okay<br>my exbest friend and i are super solid<br>shes years older than me so i respect<br>her the way i would my elders close<br>friend m even encouraged me to put in<br>the good word because she says she<br>trusts me with whoever i vouch for<br>especially since b will be working under<br>her in case she is hired and b did get<br>hired she would work under close friend<br>m and id be drowning in work from my<br>department while also training b while i<br>offload some of my responsibilities to<br>her at the request of the company to<br>make me focus on other things around<br>this time also i found myself having to<br>hold back on company gatherings we have<br>weekly dinners every wednesday because<br>my dad got diagnosed with cancer and my<br>mental health was very bad due to<br>overworking myself one day though my<br>boss scolded me which is the cofounder<br>because something went wrong with<br>handling a client and sadly it was b of<br>course my best friend is b dun so i<br>tried my best to listen to my bosss<br>anger and not to scold him i made sure<br>close friend m knew so she can also help<br>me out as b is directly under her both<br>close friend m and i spent a good hours<br>solving the problem and b didnt even<br>reply to us hours later after the shift<br>so over the weekend i only saw b<br>subtweeting bad words ~ pertaining to me<br>about work and even saying im using my<br>mental health as an excuse why she was<br>attacking me i dont know i was too busy<br>hours before that cleaning up her mess i<br>told close friend m about it and she was<br>just confused as i was where all this<br>hostility was coming from especially<br>when close friend m and i have been<br>cleaning up after friend b ever since<br>she got into the company the kicker here<br>is friend b has always confided to me<br>about having post par tum the reason why<br>i wanted her to get into our company so<br>bad because the pay was significantly<br>higher than her old company plus this<br>would greatly help her pay off her bills<br>i rarely indulge her when she confides<br>in me about her marital trouble because<br>im honestly not a good fit to give her<br>advice on that i just make sure to let<br>her know that people are not her enemy<br>her partner is not her enemy and she<br>should give them the chance its just sad<br>because she never gave me the chance and<br>immediately assumed i was mad at her for<br>having to pick up after friend b at work<br>when really i was just working on<br>autopilot with all the heavy baggage i<br>was already carrying on my own besides<br>post partum is a lot i could go longer<br>not letting her know about my dads<br>diagnosis or my own head going to shit<br>but turns out friend b and human<br>resources representative has already<br>been harboring ill will towards me a few<br>more months after that incident friend b<br>has been making it harder for me to do<br>my work so one day i snapped everything<br>got to me and this got the attention of<br>our management and our us team im not<br>one to complain but ive had enough we<br>got a mediation meeting happen friend b<br>cried in front of me accusing me of<br>making her feel like she was indebted to<br>me when all the time she was in the<br>company ive been focusing on my work and<br>helping clean up whatever work she<br>messed up just so our cofounder wouldnt<br>get mad at her even further during that<br>mediation though it was clear that human<br>resources representative was very biased<br>towards friend b in the process and<br>management even found more instances<br>where human resources representative was<br>breaking company protoc this lead to her<br>and friend b being put under pip and me<br>let off with a warning for acting<br>unbecoming of myself at work after that<br>i simply gray rocked them both i simply<br>cut off my friendship with b a year<br>friendship down the drain we were so<br>close that i even let her stay for weeks<br>in my apartment when she and her family<br>would fight so close that i missed a day<br>of work because i ran around town buying<br>them groceries and medicine when i found<br>out their house got cordoned after she<br>got covid during the pandemic i couldnt<br>handle the disrespect the worst thing<br>about this all is the human resources<br>representative is still angry with me<br>why we dont know how i feel she gets<br>angrier when i gray rock her when i stay<br>out of her way do whatever she says be<br>the bigger person and just not give in<br>to her taunts shes come to a point that<br>even when friend b was already let go of<br>the company she would stoop so low as to<br>rally all the new hires against me<br>before even getting to know me he is<br>also very petty i got hospitalized for a<br>week in november for dengue and lets be<br>honest my mental health probably made it<br>even worse i barely get hospitalized our<br>management was so worried and tasked her<br>to send fruits my way but when she found<br>out that close friend m has been<br>dropping by to see me after work no one<br>came even apple juice now to the pip<br>part aware that management is treating<br>me like that just this december i was<br>made to work from home indefinitely to<br>somehow protect me from the hostility of<br>the situation work no longer felt safe<br>for me and im sure my performance<br>decreased with the treatment ive been<br>getting at work the only one who really<br>treated me was the us team as human as<br>well as close friend mand our country<br>manager the higher ups think its because<br>human resources rep is jealous of my<br>friendship with close friend m but i<br>dont get that im not the one who forces<br>close friend m to hang out with me she<br>just wants to and i dont refuse if it<br>means i get to go out of the house we<br>even invited her out to join us before<br>until she stopped coming on her own<br>accord i just feel like its very unfair<br>that im under pip for basically being<br>bullied at work i never confront them<br>because theyre all older than me by<br>significant years i dont want trouble ​<br>whats more unfair is that i have many<br>more opportunities in the company and<br>human resources representative is just<br>paying off debt she owes to the company<br>before resigning i have so much to lose<br>while she doesnt thats all hahahah do<br>not know where im going with this unfair<br>na i was handed a pip when the only memo<br>ive ever earned in my whole career is<br>for losing an office key years ago in my<br>old company",

post for more than<br>a year and honestly i want to fucking<br>leave im looking for someone to move it<br>just so happens that i cant pass since<br>im still waiting on a good offer the<br>bills aint paying themselves and my<br>family doesnt have generational wealth<br>for me to resign without a new job it<br>used to be okay tbh i really do not like<br>taking calls i freaking hate what i do<br>but for experience and to keep myself<br>afloat i took the offer because i was<br>desperate when i was looking for jobs<br>when this was the only one that accepted<br>me and my managers were kind during my<br>interview i couldnt afford to buy any<br>longer so i took the risk and accepted<br>the offer even though it was too low<br>when the basic one was only able to make<br>up for it because the bank had good<br>benefits but even so we were so<br>underpaid we were open even though there<br>were no international clients so much<br>then shifting schedule im already naggy<br>so i know that the gy shift is<br>unnecessary because its legit that only<br>a few pieces are calling and the clients<br>concerns can wait until the morning then<br>they added am to pm and pm to am before<br>its hard to file leaves if you have<br>someone with you who cant come in they<br>have to look for someone to cover that<br>persons shift then there is also a<br>policy that if you leave you have to<br>work on a rest day to make up for it<br>like i said we are not business process<br>outsourcing but it feels like that not<br>entirely sure if this is also the case<br>with business process outsourcing so<br>dont come for me before it ended they<br>hired this new officer he hasnt been in<br>yet the wind is starting to change there<br>are so many changes in the house rules<br>that there is so much no sense clean<br>desk policy but the officers have a lot<br>of things on the table those with<br>pedestals are not allowed to be kept<br>from them only officers can do overtime<br>every fucking week the speed is fast but<br>its annoying its annoying to take leave<br>and sl we have a target because we have<br>to meet at least answer level every day<br>so we can pass the end of the month what<br>can we do we dont have agents overall in<br>a day we havent made any calls how can<br>we reach the desired al if we are short<br>of people overtime they said even though<br>we are all tired of one day its not<br>really possible that the banks clients<br>are increasing but we are still like<br>that they are hiring but only one at a<br>time how is the bottom of the offer you<br>will only accept it if you are very<br>desperate to earn money like me i was<br>dazzled because there at our mos<br>laughing out loud but its not enough its<br>still really not enough i am writing<br>this post because im very upset i<br>suddenly threw up yesterday and pooped i<br>really dont know why because im fine<br>before coming to work we have this break<br>schedule that we strictly have to follow<br>because if they dont crucify you its<br>just a joke so my shift yesterday was<br>from am to pm my lunch was at pm before<br>i heated my food i had to do number so i<br>already knew something was off then<br>suddenly i lost my appetite it could<br>have been because of something i ate but<br>i didnt eat anything that was foreign to<br>me after forcing myself to finish my bag<br>i went to the comfort room and i threw<br>up everything i ate i immediately<br>advised my team leader that im not okay<br>and if its possible whats up i just said<br>no he told me to go to the clinic first<br>and ask for meds so i did and the doctor<br>said it might be acid reflux so they<br>gave me meds for that i went back to the<br>cr and i vomited again and number it was<br>much worse this time i took the medicine<br>after doing my thing and messaged my<br>team leader again telling him that i<br>really cant do it anymore when i got<br>back to my station i didnt wake up right<br>away because i was waiting for them to<br>tell me if im going home or not they<br>were interviewing someone thats why it<br>took so long so i was irritated i called<br>first because i had a very bad trip<br>because its not my fault that i suddenly<br>vomited its not my fault that i feel bad<br>i rarely take absences even when i was a<br>student because there was no reason for<br>me to be absent when i was in gs and hs<br>i always had perfect attendance as in a<br>school year at least minutes before your<br>shift youre there im working on it i<br>always go in even if im not okay i go<br>back after their interview my team<br>leader replied that ive been to the<br>clinic its crazy then he told me to rest<br>first i came back after an hour i said<br>ill just be patient because what time is<br>it but they insisted that i stop making<br>calls first since they were already<br>asking approval from the new annoying<br>boss if they could send me home so i was<br>in the back of the office resting after<br>minutes my team leader came and sent me<br>home because he said i might not be able<br>to come in today they were concerned<br>about al because its the weekend so<br>critical al is more important than my<br>health okay okay so i didnt do it<br>anymore i went back to my station and<br>logged in i went out and went home and<br>the head of our inbound still looked at<br>me like you thought i was going to kill<br>you but when they were the ones who were<br>not okay they just twitched and left<br>immediately fucking bullshit so i booked<br>my move and on the way i started<br>throwing up again i said it was fine<br>when i got home it was a complete<br>disaster then i started getting mild<br>fever and i felt really awful i didnt<br>want to eat anything because i lost my<br>appetite and i was sure i was going to<br>throw up its just water gatorade some<br>porridge and medicine my stomach said<br>that it was last night that i might not<br>be able to go in because i still feel<br>really bad and ill observe first if i<br>can go in the next day which is today i<br>woke up around am and i threw up again<br>when i checked my phone my team leader<br>replied and it was really my fault that<br>i wasnt okay thats why i was allowed to<br>go home yesterday so i could come in<br>today im sorry and im not superman im<br>just kryptonite weakness im sorry and im<br>just prioritizing my health which is my<br>right not to go in even though im rd tom<br>until monday so i really cant go in so<br>where else are my sick leave credits for<br>decoration bitch ill just send them a<br>picture of my vomit ill end it here its<br>very annoying if you made it this far<br>thanks for taking the time to read i<br>really hope i can find a better offer so<br>i can slap their faces with my<br>resignation i will trash their attitudes<br>there is no consideration for their<br>employees we are the ones who live in<br>that unit my team leader replied that he<br>still wants me to work half a day to<br>help al",

well as for my<br>experience with company and the<br>management they dont deserve to be part<br>of this great place to work kinesu why<br>my bad experience in our company was so<br>bad let me start the whole story before<br>being part of this company i was working<br>for a small business process outsourcing<br>company along mandaluyong well the great<br>thing about this small business process<br>outsourcing that ive been in before is<br>even though their compensation package<br>is small unlike other companies around<br>it the management and bosses and their<br>politics here are people the only reason<br>i have to give up my career with them is<br>because i cant handle it and my salary<br>is still insufficient for my cost of<br>living in mandaluyong and what i give to<br>my family in the province somewhere in<br>the south by the way the technical<br>account i hold for our business process<br>outsourcing and because of the<br>insufficient and often short because the<br>salary is small i realize that its hard<br>to tell the cost of living vs what im<br>paying take note im not condo living or<br>what but my expenses are expensive so i<br>decided to just look for something more<br>work is close by and i can come home<br>with us to save money instead of paying<br>for my rental for longterm excluded<br>pajan to rent my bills electricity water<br>and internet so this is what i saw on fb<br>that they posted an open house and<br>theyre hiring for technical support with<br>good compensation package x of my salary<br>in business process outsourcing to<br>mandaluyong the offer made me very happy<br>at that time because the person above<br>listened to my request to find a job<br>nearby with a good salary and most of<br>all work in my experience as a technical<br>support this is what i hired from our<br>company and i was able to resign with<br>the previous company this is where my<br>bad experience began the first bad<br>experience listed in the job posting was<br>technical support only to find out that<br>it was not by the way tech account to<br>sales account and hard selling is still<br>pushy sale its not important if you can<br>solve the concern of your cx its more<br>important if you can sell the products<br>and services you upsell i have nothing<br>against this kind of things but i wish<br>they would be honest with they posted a<br>job and just put a sales account for<br>tech program not the one that still has<br>a technical account but you dont care if<br>it can be resolved or not as long as the<br>cx is sold then when you sell poorly you<br>are automatically terminated in<br>production to call the tenured agents<br>told us welcome to hell its really hell<br>if you dont have sales they will<br>pressure you to sell and youre really<br>embarrassing to the whole team their key<br>performance index is sales is the<br>largest chunk so if you dont pass that<br>no goodbye you really have a job no<br>matter how good you are at making calls<br>or what because thats not what they need<br>what they need is someone who is good at<br>selling even if the quality of the call<br>is useless and even if you cant help cx<br>youre in the pot for me and my<br>acquaintances that at the same time we<br>saw the entrance of the office we were<br>already sick and went home because we<br>knew that it was really hell because of<br>the hard work people really hurt me and<br>even in my previous company they knew<br>how to hurt me and i am super thankful<br>to the previous company because they<br>understand me in the village part here<br>the people in the new company dont care<br>if you die they dont care its not valid<br>to get sick here my experience here was<br>terrible imagine i got the flu to the<br>point that my body got chills then i<br>just said goodbye to the team i wish my<br>leader could request even human<br>resources rest from the clinic i have no<br>intention of sending home even for a<br>little rest because i really cant take<br>my human resources lunch so i just slept<br>and rested but i really cant alas accla<br>did you say that what is more important<br>is your hr rest oh that it will be your<br>lost hour that is impacting not only for<br>you but for the whole team what the hell<br>robot cant rest cant get sick even<br>though i have a bad flu i let him in too<br>then just hr rest i couldnt be granted<br>and because my team leader was<br>condescending about it i endured it not<br>until one time when i really couldnt<br>take it anymore my sign was that it was<br>going to be my last shift even though my<br>flu was worse i was willing to get to<br>work because its my last shift and im<br>just looking forward to my rest day my<br>flu has become severe i cant move my<br>body properly i feel pain all over my<br>body and i feel like im disabled so i<br>did a checkup right away to find out<br>that there is something serious in my<br>body that caused me to have the flu and<br>i wont disclose wthe whole medical<br>thingy to the point that i need to<br>undergo major surgery for it my team<br>leader seems to be wapakels in my<br>situation the lost sales and lost hours<br>are more important than the life and<br>death situation that i am dealing with<br>it makes me cry to imagine if i had<br>checked up earlier and had been given<br>the opportunity to rest i would have<br>taken care of it but because of their<br>selfishness and the whole management i<br>didnt focus on my health and then the<br>ending they will terminate me because i<br>am unfit for work due to my health<br>conditions and the procedure i underwent<br>did i want it if i could just distribute<br>the pain i distributed the pain to your<br>loved ones i and you are going to<br>experience this hardship i dont know if<br>you can handle it what i went through in<br>our company was draining me emotionally<br>and mentally from what i was going<br>through in my personal life and then at<br>work but i have many bad experiences<br>here in our company doesnt include it<br>its not worth what our company pays for<br>the stress they give you im not a<br>reprimanded worker i worked well but why<br>do i need to experience these things we<br>the whole management it self is teaching<br>us to be compassionate and empathetic<br>towards our customer but you yourself<br>are in management and higher op you cant<br>do it to your agents well the world goes<br>around what comes around goes around you<br>are everything you did wrong to the<br>worker you will come back to you and i<br>hope you do not come back and for the<br>record you do not deserve to be included<br>in the great place to work because you<br>do not know how to treat those who<br>worked for you properly with your many<br>cases in the national labor relations<br>commission of unjustified termination i<br>do not know how are you still able to<br>enter the criteria of best place to work<br>if your management and work environment<br>is like that i hope you can sleep<br>soundly for what you did to the poor<br>employees thats all thank you",

biggie in<br>business but i run multiple bigasan food<br>franchises small carwash village parking<br>space and airbnb in the surf area up<br>north the others there are really owned<br>by others are shared businesses i still<br>work as a fulltime in a digital agency<br>because we are still slaves to money and<br>i have been in the office since and he<br>is okay since people know me my<br>colleagues about my businesses this<br>young colleague and i also touched him<br>before he approached me to asked about<br>starting a small business so i asked<br>what business and assess what kind of<br>knowledge he has about what he will<br>enter hell be partnered by his mom and<br>girlfriend so i thought hes okay the way<br>he tells me his plans were good so i<br>offered to give him free consultancy and<br>coaching in business then i told him i<br>have a new business that i got<br>refreshment drinks maybe we can place in<br>then just divide the income it will run<br>smoothly its been months and my sales<br>are also good although the main business<br>is slowly progressing but its ups i<br>decided to invest in his business as<br>well i organized an inventory system and<br>then i looked for direct suppliers that<br>are really cheaper and also when there<br>are meetings i bring our products to<br>offer as free taste or sometimes i sell<br>them to clients haha ​​but the thing i<br>notice is why their sales are slow<br>before the employee changes and always<br>closes because there is no one i asked<br>him about the employees because on paper<br>it seems well compensated in the viber<br>chats they are very okay to talk to but<br>he said that they are acting so i<br>offered my help and called my batchmate<br>at school who is looking for work in my<br>car wash but i begged him that maybe he<br>can go there first its one store luckily<br>its just minutes away from the location<br>its actually closer than my carwash so<br>at the first month the batchmates<br>feedback was okay but not to my<br>colleague but to his gf and mom to him<br>he said to me is he rarely shows up and<br>always has a bad mouth about them as<br>employees i asked my batchmate if he<br>wants to move to the carwash which he<br>without any hesitation said yes right<br>there i know im right i think there is<br>an issue colleague running a business he<br>got mad at me when i told him im going<br>to pull out my batchmate because hes<br>really my person at the carwash saying<br>hell have a hard time finding a store<br>manager who isnt artistic i told him ill<br>hire someone for his convenience i got<br>of a person and he is really good at<br>managing a store but i told him to<br>report to me what is happening in the<br>store weeks later she told me that my<br>colleague is not doing well so i decided<br>to make a surprise visit i asked our<br>store manager to inform me when i go<br>after all i almost thought that i was<br>the one running our business from the<br>money i brought in the clients and bulk<br>orders that i entered as sales and more<br>last saturday i received a message from<br>the store manager that a colleague was<br>going with his gf and mom so i went too<br>i arrived minutes later after them and i<br>went through the back door so they<br>wouldnt see you i had just entered the<br>gate i heard my colleagues voice saying<br>leave in front of me youre useless so i<br>didnt go in first since i heard from the<br>near window their convos then i heard<br>him again talking to that employee go<br>home youre stupid youre stupid thats<br>your job that employee ran to open the<br>door where i was standing outside when<br>he opened it he was surprised that i was<br>there i saw her eyes that were teary so<br>i signaled not to ill wait for him<br>because im going to enter the store upon<br>entering i heard him shouting to his gf<br>who was in the storefront tell the store<br>manager to speed up the audit and maybe<br>ill look for a report but its still like<br>the conversation every saturday<br>afternoon pass the store manager is the<br>one who reported to me on her break but<br>my colleague told her to do the task<br>even on break since she can do it while<br>sitting in my mind the dude is very<br>different compared when he is in the<br>office he is okay to talk to and it is<br>very positive his character you can see<br>his immaturity but you get it because<br>hes still young but hes improving since<br>im already inside he turned his back on<br>me i called his attention he was<br>surprised and asked if why didnt i go in<br>front i told him i was already there and<br>i heard him and i heard everything he<br>said about our employees to his badmouth<br>against me he asked me for a managements<br>talk he said we talked with his gf i<br>accepted but i asked the employees to<br>join the meeting to find out why this is<br>happening i was shocked when i heard<br>from our employees the words that you<br>dont preach so dont feel like an expert<br>its just a sari sari store your strategy<br>is not yet corporate and youre boasting<br>youre worthless these words came to my<br>colleagues mouth when he was angry so<br>thats why it turns out that our people<br>are leaving even if i leave like that i<br>let our employees out but i requested to<br>close the store and go home so they can<br>cool down a bit i talk to my colleague<br>and his partner that i cannot run<br>business with them like that he is right<br>there i said i will pullout my<br>investments and assets my colleague got<br>angry he said i can pullout but only my<br>drinks not the money i invested thought<br>maybe i am not reading the books i said<br>we gain since i invested so i will take<br>my money and its also a different use<br>because the profit comes from me and if<br>he doesnt want to give it last monday i<br>pulled out my investments from them i<br>talked to my colleagues mom and gf its<br>easier to talk about and they helped me<br>withdraw my invested money from the bank<br>we notarized the paperwork the store is<br>closed since then none of our employees<br>came in the colleague did not show up<br>that time and was also absent from the<br>office until now because he is not part<br>of his business he spoke to me i told my<br>boss that i can work with him<br>professionally in the company but not as<br>a business partner earlier i received a<br>separate viber group from our employees<br>and they said that they will not come in<br>i asked them if did they get paid the<br>last pay they didnt want to take it i<br>told them they didnt want to pay but i<br>said they entered it so i will pay them<br>they are right i also told them i will<br>help them find new jobs that fit them<br>luckily si store manager i have already<br>walked to my client before she will<br>start ata by feb the one i refer them to<br>my clients na convenience store company<br>and logisticscourier company i also send<br>them a sack of rice each and some<br>groceries the experience is really<br>embarrassing and i learned a lot from<br>this i will always be grateful to those<br>employees who worked for me so as much<br>as possible ill give them extended help<br>at the very least we all got out of that<br>toxic environment ​ ​",

because im not willing to<br>sacrifice my abilities to sustain my<br>family to speak my mind i know that its<br>a fine line but for the time being im<br>not willing to cross it but i feel like<br>a lot of people here can resonate with<br>this especially those in the level of<br>management or those who own small<br>businesses in order to make ends meet<br>this is going to be a rant and im not<br>pouting or asking for pity so if you<br>think thats what im doing just erase<br>that notion from your mind if you even<br>take the time to read this a lot of<br>people ask me why i dont go out why i<br>dont go to bars why dont go to house<br>parties why at the very most i make<br>shortterm social appearances at<br>gatherings and why for the most part<br>that i spend my free time in my home<br>doing whatever the hell it is that i do<br>so first off lets address the whole<br>concept of whatever it is that i do the<br>first and most obvious thing is that i<br>take take care of my house to the best<br>of my abilities i keep things clean i<br>make sure the dishes are clean i make<br>sure the floors are clean and make sure<br>the bathroom is clean and i make sure<br>that my house is somewhat presentable<br>especially because i have a kiddo and a<br>kiddo should never ever have to live in<br>a dump i also have my own passions and<br>my own pleasures and my own enjoyments<br>if you know me you know that i love<br>playing guitar and if youre a guitar<br>player you know that not only am i a<br>guitar player but im also a tone chaser<br>its one of my passions ive been after my<br>tone ever since i discovered that you<br>can make a guitar sound good without<br>diming the treblebassgain and killing<br>the mids i also like to eat good food<br>and considering that my present<br>circumstance puts me in a situation<br>where half the time im by myself and the<br>other half the time i have my kiddo i go<br>way out of my way to make sure that i<br>can craft delicious meals not only for<br>myself but also for me and my daughter<br>on top of that i have a yard to maintain<br>i know that some of my friends here take<br>different stances when it comes to yard<br>mainte ce and i respect all of those<br>opinions im not hank hill when it comes<br>to my yard i dont want to have the best<br>yard in town i just want to make sure<br>that my yard looks somewhat presentable<br>yet also is inviting to the natural<br>aspects that yards attract pollinating<br>insects adorable fuzzy critters all that<br>shit i try to make my yard look clean<br>but i dont go to the extreme of making<br>it look manicured to the point of<br>winning some sort of stupid lawn award<br>im also a human i require a minimal<br>amount of sleep during every solar cycle<br>to make sure that my body and my mind<br>can heal and recharge and be prepared<br>for the hurdles of the next day so lets<br>discuss the hurdles of the next day im a<br>manager i dont just manage one specific<br>aspect of a business i manage the entire<br>fucking aspect the fi cial aspect the<br>customer service aspect the human<br>resources aspect inventory productivity<br>everything i literally manage every<br>single aspect of keeping the body shop<br>that i am an integral part of running<br>paperwork making sure that people are<br>getting a fair wage making sure that the<br>customers are getting way more than they<br>pay for making sure that my vendors are<br>able to supply the commodities necessary<br>to make sure that daytoday operations<br>can run smoothly without having<br>unrealistic expectations of them making<br>sure that calls get answered and<br>voicemails get returned at the end of<br>the day times out of im fucking tired<br>not just physically not just mentally<br>not just emotionally its the unholy<br>trifecta and whats fucked up is that<br>theres not days in the week but rather<br>seven work = hours a week commune =<br>hours a week getting ready = hours a<br>week thats hours a week minimum to make<br>sure that i can make a fair and honest<br>living in order to support my daughter<br>pay my bills and fi cially cover my<br>obligations im not bitching about money<br>this isnt about money this is about time<br>of my time alive is dedicated to my<br>career im not bitching about that what i<br>am bitching about is people expecting me<br>to be able to perform at peak<br>performance when it comes to social<br>functions outside of work is a lot<br>closer to than and you better believe<br>that when it comes to being a parent and<br>being a responsible employeeemployer i<br>give both of those tasks my all i know<br>this was longwinded but it serves a<br>purpose if the people that you know seem<br>like theyre burnt out or not up to the<br>task of socializing at the same pace<br>that you are dont give them grief for it<br>we all recharge in different ways we all<br>should be able to set aside some time<br>for ourselves along with time for the<br>people that we give a fuck about and<br>sometimes its hard to find that balance<br>were all obligated to work for an income<br>in order to sustain the lives that we<br>live and that will never change in the<br>foreseeable future but you know what can<br>change this fucked up notion that people<br>have unlimited amounts of energy on<br>reserve because we dont we get older we<br>get tired we get exhausted and thats not<br>just a physical thing its also a mental<br>thing its also an emotional thing i dont<br>give a fuck if you cut me in general<br>some slack but as a

meeting earlier so it will<br>continue tomorrow warning suicide<br>ideation toxic workplace abusive parents<br>bear with me maybe long but maybe<br>necessary so that its clear if no one<br>replies maybe ill post it again in<br>another subreddit i just read and<br>watched from the internet that human<br>resources are more concerned with the<br>companys growth its image etc than with<br>the plight and wellbeing of employees in<br>fact human resources mentioned in the<br>beginning of the conversation that she<br>is trying to create projects for the<br>betterment of the company she is not a<br>direct indication that she might be<br>biased for the company but she also did<br>not say about what she could do for the<br>employees themselves she also<br>highlighted the importance of hard work<br>and the one i mentioned was one of my<br>complaints about having a workload for<br>people she replied by saying that the<br>positions are really multidisciplinary<br>nowadays tbf maybe since she was in a<br>hurry to leave at that point she only<br>thought it was variety of work instead<br>of workload amount but the latter was<br>said my people may be able to use what<br>you saidclaimed and use it against you<br>the thing is there is a scenario at work<br>but if i cannot trust human resources<br>since they are not really foremployees<br>like the labor union i dont want to<br>continue telling my story since it was<br>cut off our convo was due to time limit<br>so i was only able to say that they were<br>nice around the story because small talk<br>first caught me off guard and i forgot<br>warning of other online people about<br>human resources in general however maybe<br>wrong me good people exist after all<br>even in the most surprising of places in<br>fact one of the higher up bosses noticed<br>my depression so she told human<br>resources to reach out to me though to<br>be fair even this doesnt excuse the<br>toxicity of the company itself allowing<br>catcalling a supervisor throwing away<br>someones shoes etc and i need help i<br>dont have much money the salary is<br>correct and there is still debt to pay i<br>dont want to go back to abusive parents<br>and ive been feeling suicidal because<br>they dont want to regularize me and<br>comforting that my plan z is the end<br>instead of being a fat person or feel<br>the love language of my abuse again so<br>if human resources and other people have<br>my best interests that would be<br>beneficial the higher up supervisor even<br>told me that maybe human resources can<br>offer me a job to another sister company<br>to put everything in context this is<br>what happened during my work assessment<br>i had a minipanic attack when the words<br>my boss used were more fearinducing like<br>what will the higher ups say or what<br>will be our excuse when you wont meet<br>the quota i know its less intimidating<br>if you are not there tbf i only have<br>less than half of the tasks so maybe he<br>remembers that thats why hes slowing me<br>down what if im the second person to do<br>it but still you know why blame someone<br>for not meeting the quota if you know<br>the workload amount is for people or<br>would eventually be im also filled<br>because im giving r i heard her<br>complaints about me and she just brushed<br>them off she didnt even acknowledge them<br>in the end i couldnt bear my upset i<br>replied that i will talk to the higher<br>ups the next time she mentioned them i<br>also said that i would quit after saying<br>that i panicked bec i remembered my fi<br>cialfamily situation but i was too upset<br>to mitigate the damage i call it a<br>minipanic attack bec i became aggressive<br>with my behavior defensive mode and i<br>cannot seem return playing submissive i<br>also cried after boss left and i<br>attempted to knock on the literal<br>neighboring office different company and<br>ask for a job because i saw the<br>secretary there last time and she said<br>how kind her boss was and had even<br>recently offered a job to a family<br>friend that she hopes his boss lives for<br>a long time to help more people but when<br>i got there she was cold and adamant<br>that her boss was tired she also<br>reported me to my boss that i went to<br>them crying pls in the comments later i<br>already know my mistake pls be gentle i<br>feel ashamed and raw about it they later<br>told me that the secretaries boss was<br>sensitive i dont know if body or<br>emotions and didnt like surprise<br>meetings anyway boss implied that that<br>was the sign shes looking for since she<br>was undecided about me and said she also<br>didnt like my attitude during assessment<br>she said she would have given me the<br>regularization as long as i nodded and<br>said that i will do my best not her<br>exact words but along those lines but<br>she said i didnt do well with the<br>neighboring secretaries boss i feel so<br>ashamed im sorry everyone it seems like<br>a bad image to them and why do you think<br>i have anger issues i tried to explain<br>asked for a second chance but he said it<br>was too late because even the higher ups<br>have already agreed with the decision im<br>so upset and wanna go absent without<br>leave but my coworkers convinced me to<br>wait for the last pay and certificate of<br>experience i went half day the day i was<br>told and one of my friends heard the<br>comment of my wanting to kill myself he<br>took me seriously it seemed because my<br>vibe was pretty gloomy then suddenly<br>many calls and texts sent to me he told<br>the whole office in his panic the next<br>day was normal since i explained via<br>text to my panicked friend to calm down<br>i know my boss knows but she doesnt<br>mention it so thats the whole story the<br>question is it safe to tell hr will my<br>saying so benefit future employees in<br>regards to mental health i told him but<br>not everything i havent mentioned around<br>the part when i knocked on the<br>neighboring office i also mentioned my<br>panic attack and when she asked me if<br>ive experienced it before i said yes i<br>said that my parents were the cause of<br>my panic attacks before bec they have a<br>toxic personality style so back to my<br>question would it be good to tell human<br>resources the whole story what are the<br>pros and cons and if i decided not to<br>tell the whole story the next time we<br>meet what will i say this human<br>resources spans more than one company so<br>he is busy and its not like my coworkers<br>intheknow would care enough to narrate<br>to human resources so that shed know my<br>story is incomplete what do you think",

          "im the one whos aggrieved but im the one<br>who was put on pip because its the one<br>year anniversary at my work and i dont<br>know how ive made it this long just this<br>month i was put on pip for not being<br>culturally fit in our office the reason<br>i rocked the ex human resources<br>representative just a context about me<br>im one of the youngest members of the<br>company and the gap between us and our<br>older coworkers is at least years<br>basically my coworkers are all in their<br>early to mid our company is small but<br>this isnt my first company but this is<br>one of the first companies where i felt<br>very comfortable with the work and<br>environment were very lean also in our<br>company for the philippines we are all a<br>team it all started when i developed a<br>friendship with one of the managers from<br>a different department now we dont<br>exactly work in the same department so<br>work has nothing to do with how we<br>became friends it just turned out one<br>day that she liked hanging out with me<br>and we listen to a lot of similar music<br>we got even closer when i offered to<br>help her get tickets to one concert she<br>wanted to go do bad but she conflicted<br>with a worktrip i had the connections<br>and i didnt bother so i secured them for<br>her and she was thankful ever since then<br>wed get into conversations about<br>concerts music fests travel the like is<br>just because i escape from all the<br>stresses of work thats also the reason<br>why i work hard to be able to afford<br>those now comes the trouble my close<br>friend m in the office is also best<br>friends with the human resources<br>representative of the company he is<br>those who enter and they go way back<br>even being co workers in a previous job<br>once before our company now before i<br>would even feel like im intruding in<br>their friendship when close friend would<br>ask me to go with them both to buy<br>office supplies or run errands for the<br>company during weekends again im a<br>homebody and going out sometimes would<br>do my mental health good the dynamic is<br>okay in the first case i just noticed<br>that it seems like a close friend gets<br>treated badly by human resources<br>representative me minding my own<br>business kept that observation to myself<br>because at the end of the day i dont<br>have a say in their friendship if time<br>is the basis they are probably tighter<br>than me and my close friend because<br>theyve been friends for longer but that<br>doesnt really mean anything to me months<br>into my employment at the company i also<br>found one of my close friends lets name<br>her b needing work and im the type to<br>help out whenever i can so i put in a<br>good work and thankfully b got in take<br>note around this time we are still okay<br>my exbest friend and i are super solid<br>shes years older than me so i respect<br>her the way i would my elders close<br>friend m even encouraged me to put in<br>the good word because she says she<br>trusts me with whoever i vouch for<br>especially since b will be working under<br>her in case she is hired and b did get<br>hired she would work under close friend<br>m and id be drowning in work from my<br>department while also training b while i<br>offload some of my responsibilities to<br>her at the request of the company to<br>make me focus on other things around<br>this time also i found myself having to<br>hold back on company gatherings we have<br>weekly dinners every wednesday because<br>my dad got diagnosed with cancer and my<br>mental health was very bad due to<br>overworking myself one day though my<br>boss scolded me which is the cofounder<br>because something went wrong with<br>handling a client and sadly it was b of<br>course my best friend is b dun so i<br>tried my best to listen to my bosss<br>anger and not to scold him i made sure<br>close friend m knew so she can also help<br>me out as b is directly under her both<br>close friend m and i spent a good hours<br>solving the problem and b didnt even<br>reply to us hours later after the shift<br>so over the weekend i only saw b<br>subtweeting bad words ~ pertaining to me<br>about work and even saying im using my<br>mental health as an excuse why she was<br>attacking me i dont know i was too busy<br>hours before that cleaning up her mess i<br>told close friend m about it and she was<br>just confused as i was where all this<br>hostility was coming from especially<br>when close friend m and i have been<br>cleaning up after friend b ever since<br>she got into the company the kicker here<br>is friend b has always confided to me<br>about having post par tum the reason why<br>i wanted her to get into our company so<br>bad because the pay was significantly<br>higher than her old company plus this<br>would greatly help her pay off her bills<br>i rarely indulge her when she confides<br>in me about her marital trouble because<br>im honestly not a good fit to give her<br>advice on that i just make sure to let<br>her know that people are not her enemy<br>her partner is not her enemy and she<br>should give them the chance its just sad<br>because she never gave me the chance and<br>immediately assumed i was mad at her for<br>having to pick up after friend b at work<br>when really i was just working on<br>autopilot with all the heavy baggage i<br>was already carrying on my own besides<br>post partum is a lot i could go longer<br>not letting her know about my dads<br>diagnosis or my own head going to shit<br>but turns out friend b and human<br>resources representative has already<br>been harboring ill will towards me a few<br>more months after that incident friend b<br>has been making it harder for me to do<br>my work so one day i snapped everything<br>got to me and this got the attention of<br>our management and our us team im not<br>one to complain but ive had enough we<br>got a mediation meeting happen friend b<br>cried in front of me accusing me of<br>making her feel like she was indebted to<br>me when all the time she was in the<br>company ive been focusing on my work and<br>helping clean up whatever work she<br>messed up just so our cofounder wouldnt<br>get mad at her even further during that<br>mediation though it was clear that human<br>resources representative was very biased<br>towards friend b in the process and<br>management even found more instances<br>where human resources representative was<br>breaking company protoc this lead to her<br>and friend b being put under pip and me<br>let off with a warning for acting<br>unbecoming of myself at work after that<br>i simply gray rocked them both i simply<br>cut off my friendship with b a year<br>friendship down the drain we were so<br>close that i even let her stay for weeks<br>in my apartment when she and her family<br>would fight so close that i missed a day<br>of work because i ran around town buying<br>them groceries and medicine when i found<br>out their house got cordoned after she<br>got covid during the pandemic i couldnt<br>handle the disrespect the worst thing<br>about this all is the human resources<br>representative is still angry with me<br>why we dont know how i feel she gets<br>angrier when i gray rock her when i stay<br>out of her way do whatever she says be<br>the bigger person and just not give in<br>to her taunts shes come to a point that<br>even when friend b was already let go of<br>the company she would stoop so low as to<br>rally all the new hires against me<br>before even getting to know me he is<br>also very petty i got hospitalized for a<br>week in november for dengue and lets be<br>honest my mental health probably made it<br>even worse i barely get hospitalized our<br>management was so worried and tasked her<br>to send fruits my way but when she found<br>out that close friend m has been<br>dropping by to see me after work no one<br>came even apple juice now to the pip<br>part aware that management is treating<br>me like that just this december i was<br>made to work from home indefinitely to<br>somehow protect me from the hostility of<br>the situation work no longer felt safe<br>for me and im sure my performance<br>decreased with the treatment ive been<br>getting at work the only one who really<br>treated me was the us team as human as<br>well as close friend mand our country<br>manager the higher ups think its because<br>human resources rep is jealous of my<br>friendship with close friend m but i<br>dont get that im not the one who forces<br>close friend m to hang out with me she<br>just wants to and i dont refuse if it<br>means i get to go out of the house we<br>even invited her out to join us before<br>until she stopped coming on her own<br>accord i just feel like its very unfair<br>that im under pip for basically being<br>bullied at work i never confront them<br>because theyre all older than me by<br>significant years i dont want trouble ​<br>whats more unfair is that i have many<br>more opportunities in the company and<br>human resources representative is just<br>paying off debt she owes to the company<br>before resigning i have so much to lose<br>while she doesnt thats all hahahah do<br>not know where im going with this unfair<br>na i was handed a pip when the only memo<br>ive ever earned in my whole career

post for more than<br>a year and honestly i want to fucking<br>leave im looking for someone to move it<br>just so happens that i cant pass since<br>im still waiting on a good offer the<br>bills aint paying themselves and my<br>family doesnt have generational wealth<br>for me to resign without a new job it<br>used to be okay tbh i really do not like<br>taking calls i freaking hate what i do<br>but for experience and to keep myself<br>afloat i took the offer because i was<br>desperate when i was looking for jobs<br>when this was the only one that accepted<br>me and my managers were kind during my<br>interview i couldnt afford to buy any<br>longer so i took the risk and accepted<br>the offer even though it was too low<br>when the basic one was only able to make<br>up for it because the bank had good<br>benefits but even so we were so<br>underpaid we were open even though there<br>were no international clients so much<br>then shifting schedule im already naggy<br>so i know that the gy shift is<br>unnecessary because its legit that only<br>a few pieces are calling and the clients<br>concerns can wait until the morning then<br>they added am to pm and pm to am before<br>its hard to file leaves if you have<br>someone with you who cant come in they<br>have to look for someone to cover that<br>persons shift then there is also a<br>policy that if you leave you have to<br>work on a rest day to make up for it<br>like i said we are not business process<br>outsourcing but it feels like that not<br>entirely sure if this is also the case<br>with business process outsourcing so<br>dont come for me before it ended they<br>hired this new officer he hasnt been in<br>yet the wind is starting to change there<br>are so many changes in the house rules<br>that there is so much no sense clean<br>desk policy but the officers have a lot<br>of things on the table those with<br>pedestals are not allowed to be kept<br>from them only officers can do overtime<br>every fucking week the speed is fast but<br>its annoying its annoying to take leave<br>and sl we have a target because we have<br>to meet at least answer level every day<br>so we can pass the end of the month what<br>can we do we dont have agents overall in<br>a day we havent made any calls how can<br>we reach the desired al if we are short<br>of people overtime they said even though<br>we are all tired of one day its not<br>really possible that the banks clients<br>are increasing but we are still like<br>that they are hiring but only one at a<br>time how is the bottom of the offer you<br>will only accept it if you are very<br>desperate to earn money like me i was<br>dazzled because there at our mos<br>laughing out loud but its not enough its<br>still really not enough i am writing<br>this post because im very upset i<br>suddenly threw up yesterday and pooped i<br>really dont know why because im fine<br>before coming to work we have this break<br>schedule that we strictly have to follow<br>because if they dont crucify you its<br>just a joke so my shift yesterday was<br>from am to pm my lunch was at pm before<br>i heated my food i had to do number so i<br>already knew something was off then<br>suddenly i lost my appetite it could<br>have been because of something i ate but<br>i didnt eat anything that was foreign to<br>me after forcing myself to finish my bag<br>i went to the comfort room and i threw<br>up everything i ate i immediately<br>advised my team leader that im not okay<br>and if its possible whats up i just said<br>no he told me to go to the clinic first<br>and ask for meds so i did and the doctor<br>said it might be acid reflux so they<br>gave me meds for that i went back to the<br>cr and i vomited again and number it was<br>much worse this time i took the medicine<br>after doing my thing and messaged my<br>team leader again telling him that i<br>really cant do it anymore when i got<br>back to my station i didnt wake up right<br>away because i was waiting for them to<br>tell me if im going home or not they<br>were interviewing someone thats why it<br>took so long so i was irritated i called<br>first because i had a very bad trip<br>because its not my fault that i suddenly<br>vomited its not my fault that i feel bad<br>i rarely take absences even when i was a<br>student because there was no reason for<br>me to be absent when i was in gs and hs<br>i always had perfect attendance as in a<br>school year at least minutes before your<br>shift youre there im working on it i<br>always go in even if im not okay i go<br>back after their interview my team<br>leader replied that ive been to the<br>clinic its crazy then he told me to rest<br>first i came back after an hour i said<br>ill just be patient because what time is<br>it but they insisted that i stop making<br>calls first since they were already<br>asking approval from the new annoying<br>boss if they could send me home so i was<br>in the back of the office resting after<br>minutes my team leader came and sent me<br>home because he said i might not be able<br>to come in today they were concerned<br>about al because its the weekend so<br>critical al is more important than my<br>health okay okay so i didnt do it<br>anymore i went back to my station and<br>logged in i went out and went home and<br>the head of our inbound still looked at<br>me like you thought i was going to kill<br>you but when they were the ones who were<br>not okay they just twitched and left<br>immediately fucking bullshit so i booked<br>my move and on the way i started<br>throwing up again i said it was fine<br>when i got home it was a complete<br>disaster then i started getting mild<br>fever and i felt really awful i didnt<br>want to eat anything because i lost my<br>appetite and i was sure i was going to<br>throw up its just water gatorade some<br>porridge and medicine my stomach said<br>that it was last night that i might not<br>be able to go in because i still feel<br>really bad and ill observe first if i<br>can go in the next day which is today i<br>woke up around am and i threw up again<br>when i checked my phone my team leader<br>replied and it was really my fault that<br>i wasnt okay thats why i was allowed to<br>go home yesterday so i could come in<br>today im sorry and im not superman im<br>just kryptonite weakness im sorry and im<br>just prioritizing my health which is my<br>right not to go in even though im rd tom<br>until monday so i really cant go in so<br>where else are my sick leave credits for<br>decoration bitch ill just send them a<br>picture of my vomit ill

          "great place to work hello everyone i<br>just need to get this of my chest to<br>move forward so i was working for this<br>company that is part of great place to<br>work in the philippines well as for my<br>experience with company and the<br>management they dont deserve to be part<br>of this great place to work kinesu why<br>my bad experience in our company was so<br>bad let me start the whole story before<br>being part of this company i was working<br>for a small business process outsourcing<br>company along mandaluyong well the great<br>thing about this small business process<br>outsourcing that ive been in before is<br>even though their compensation package<br>is small unlike other companies around<br>it the management and bosses and their<br>politics here are people the only reason<br>i have to give up my career with them is<br>because i cant handle it and my salary<br>is still insufficient for my cost of<br>living in mandaluyong and what i give to<br>my family in the province somewhere in<br>the south by the way the technical<br>account i hold for our business process<br>outsourcing and because of the<br>insufficient and often short because the<br>salary is small i realize that its hard<br>to tell the cost of living vs what im<br>paying take note im not condo living or<br>what but my expenses are expensive so i<br>decided to just look for something more<br>work is close by and i can come home<br>with us to save money instead of paying<br>for my rental for longterm excluded<br>pajan to rent my bills electricity water<br>and internet so this is what i saw on fb<br>that they posted an open house and<br>theyre hiring for technical support with<br>good compensation package x of my salary<br>in business process outsourcing to<br>mandaluyong the offer made me very happy<br>at that time because the person above<br>listened to my request to find a job<br>nearby with a good salary and most of<br>all work in my experience as a technical<br>support this is what i hired from our<br>company and i was able to resign with<br>the previous company this is where my<br>bad experience began the first bad<br>experience listed in the job posting was<br>technical support only to find out that<br>it was not by the way tech account to<br>sales account and hard selling is still<br>pushy sale its not important if you can<br>solve the concern of your cx its more<br>important if you can sell the products<br>and services you upsell i have nothing<br>against this kind of things but i wish<br>they would be honest with they posted a<br>job and just put a sales account for<br>tech program not the one that still has<br>a technical account but you dont care if<br>it can be resolved or not as long as the<br>cx is sold then when you sell poorly you<br>are automatically terminated in<br>production to call the tenured agents<br>told us welcome to hell its really hell<br>if you dont have sales they will<br>pressure you to sell and youre really<br>embarrassing to the whole team their key<br>performance index is sales is the<br>largest chunk so if you dont pass that<br>no goodbye you really have a job no<br>matter how good you are at making calls<br>or what because thats not what they need<br>what they need is someone who is good at<br>selling even if the quality of the call<br>is useless and even if you cant help cx<br>youre in the pot for me and my<br>acquaintances that at the same time we<br>saw the entrance of the office we were<br>already sick and went home because we<br>knew that it was really hell because of<br>the hard work people really hurt me and<br>even in my previous company they knew<br>how to hurt me and i am super thankful<br>to the previous company because they<br>understand me in the village part here<br>the people in the new company dont care<br>if you die they dont care its not valid<br>to get sick here my experience here was<br>terrible imagine i got the flu to the<br>point that my body got chills then i<br>just said goodbye to the team i wish my<br>leader could request even human<br>resources rest from the clinic i have no<br>intention of sending home even for a<br>little rest because i really cant take<br>my human resources lunch so i just slept<br>and rested but i really cant alas accla<br>did you say that what is more important<br>is your hr rest oh that it will be your<br>lost hour that is impacting not only for<br>you but for the whole team what the hell<br>robot cant rest cant get sick even<br>though i have a bad flu i let him in too<br>then just hr rest i couldnt be granted<br>and because my team leader was<br>condescending about it i endured it not<br>until one time when i really couldnt<br>take it anymore my sign was that it was<br>going to be my last shift even though my<br>flu was worse i was willing to get to<br>work because its my last shift and im<br>just looking forward to my rest day my<br>flu has become severe i cant move my<br>body properly i feel pain all over my<br>body and i feel like im disabled so i<br>did a checkup right away to find out<br>that there is something serious in my<br>body that caused me to have the flu and<br>i wont disclose wthe whole medical<br>thingy to the point that i need to<br>undergo major surgery for it my team<br>leader seems to be wapakels in my<br>situation the lost sales and lost hours<br>are more important than the life and<br>death situation that i am dealing with<br>it makes me cry to imagine if i had<br>checked up earlier and had been given<br>the opportunity to rest i would have<br>taken care of it but because of their<br>selfishness and the whole management i<br>didnt focus on my health and then the<br>ending they will terminate me because i<br>am unfit for work due to my health<br>conditions and the procedure i underwent<br>did i want it if i could just distribute<br>the pain i distributed the pain to your<br>loved ones i and you are going to<br>experience this hardship i dont know if<br>you can handle it what i went through in<br>our company was draining me emotionally<br>and mentally from what i was going<br>through in my personal life and then at<br>work but i have many bad experiences<br>here in our company doesnt include it<br>its not worth what our company pays for<br>the stress they give you im not a<br>reprimanded worker i worked well but why<br>do i need to experience these things we<br>the whole management it self is teaching<br>us to be compassionate and empathetic<br>towards our customer but you yourself<br>are in management and higher op you cant<br>do it to your agents well the world goes<br>around what comes around goes around you<br>are everything you did wrong to the<br>worker you will come back to you and i<br>hope you do not come back and for the<br>record you do not deserve to be included<br>in the great place to work because you<br>do not know how to treat those who<br>worked for you properly with your

shared businesses i still<br>work as a fulltime in a digital agency<br>because we are still slaves to money and<br>i have been in the office since and he<br>is okay since people know me my<br>colleagues about my businesses this<br>young colleague and i also touched him<br>before he approached me to asked about<br>starting a small business so i asked<br>what business and assess what kind of<br>knowledge he has about what he will<br>enter hell be partnered by his mom and<br>girlfriend so i thought hes okay the way<br>he tells me his plans were good so i<br>offered to give him free consultancy and<br>coaching in business then i told him i<br>have a new business that i got<br>refreshment drinks maybe we can place in<br>then just divide the income it will run<br>smoothly its been months and my sales<br>are also good although the main business<br>is slowly progressing but its ups i<br>decided to invest in his business as<br>well i organized an inventory system and<br>then i looked for direct suppliers that<br>are really cheaper and also when there<br>are meetings i bring our products to<br>offer as free taste or sometimes i sell<br>them to clients haha ​​but the thing i<br>notice is why their sales are slow<br>before the employee changes and always<br>closes because there is no one i asked<br>him about the employees because on paper<br>it seems well compensated in the viber<br>chats they are very okay to talk to but<br>he said that they are acting so i<br>offered my help and called my batchmate<br>at school who is looking for work in my<br>car wash but i begged him that maybe he<br>can go there first its one store luckily<br>its just minutes away from the location<br>its actually closer than my carwash so<br>at the first month the batchmates<br>feedback was okay but not to my<br>colleague but to his gf and mom to him<br>he said to me is he rarely shows up and<br>always has a bad mouth about them as<br>employees i asked my batchmate if he<br>wants to move to the carwash which he<br>without any hesitation said yes right<br>there i know im right i think there is<br>an issue colleague running a business he<br>got mad at me when i told him im going<br>to pull out my batchmate because hes<br>really my person at the carwash saying<br>hell have a hard time finding a store<br>manager who isnt artistic i told him ill<br>hire someone for his convenience i got<br>of a person and he is really good at<br>managing a store but i told him to<br>report to me what is happening in the<br>store weeks later she told me that my<br>colleague is not doing well so i decided<br>to make a surprise visit i asked our<br>store manager to inform me when i go<br>after all i almost thought that i was<br>the one running our business from the<br>money i brought in the clients and bulk<br>orders that i entered as sales and more<br>last saturday i received a message from<br>the store manager that a colleague was<br>going with his gf and mom so i went too<br>i arrived minutes later after them and i<br>went through the back door so they<br>wouldnt see you i had just entered the<br>gate i heard my colleagues voice saying<br>leave in front of me youre useless so i<br>didnt go in first since i heard from the<br>near window their convos then i heard<br>him again talking to that employee go<br>home youre stupid youre stupid thats<br>your job that employee ran to open the<br>door where i was standing outside when<br>he opened it he was surprised that i was<br>there i saw her eyes that were teary so<br>i signaled not to ill wait for him<br>because im going to enter the store upon<br>entering i heard him shouting to his gf<br>who was in the storefront tell the store<br>manager to speed up the audit and maybe<br>ill look for a report but its still like<br>the conversation every saturday<br>afternoon pass the store manager is the<br>one who reported to me on her break but<br>my colleague told her to do the task<br>even on break since she can do it while<br>sitting in my mind the dude is very<br>different compared when he is in the<br>office he is okay to talk to and it is<br>very positive his character you can see<br>his immaturity but you get it because<br>hes still young but hes improving since<br>im already inside he turned his back on<br>me i called his attention he was<br>surprised and asked if why didnt i go in<br>front i told him i was already there and<br>i heard him and i heard everything he<br>said about our employees to his badmouth<br>against me he asked me for a managements<br>talk he said we talked with his gf i<br>accepted but i asked the employees to<br>join the meeting to find out why this is<br>happening i was shocked when i heard<br>from our employees the words that you<br>dont preach so dont feel like an expert<br>its just a sari sari store your strategy<br>is not yet corporate and youre boasting<br>youre worthless these words came to my<br>colleagues mouth when he was angry so<br>thats why it turns out that our people<br>are leaving even if i leave like that i<br>let our employees out but i requested to<br>close the store and go home so they can<br>cool down a bit i talk to my colleague<br>and his partner that i cannot run<br>business with them like that he is right<br>there i said i will pullout my<br>investments and assets my colleague got<br>angry he said i can pullout but only my<br>drinks not the money i invested thought<br>maybe i am not reading the books i said<br>we gain since i invested so i will take<br>my money and its also a different use<br>because the profit comes from me and if<br>he doesnt want to give it last monday i<br>pulled out my investments from them i<br>talked to my colleagues mom and gf its<br>easier to talk about and they helped me<br>withdraw my invested money from the bank<br>we notarized the paperwork the store is<br>closed since then none of our employees<br>came in the colleague did not show up<br>that time and was also absent from the<br>office until now because he is not part<br>of his business he spoke to me i told my<br>boss that i can work with him<br>professionally in the company but not as<br>a business partner earlier i received a<br>separate viber group from our employees<br>and they said that they will not come in<br>i asked them if did they get paid the<br>last pay they didnt want to take it i<br>told them they didnt want to pay but i<br>said they entered it so i will pay them<br>they are right i also told them i will<br>help them find new jobs that fit them<br>luckily si store manager i

house to the best<br>of my abilities i keep things clean i<br>make sure the dishes are clean i make<br>sure the floors are clean and make sure<br>the bathroom is clean and i make sure<br>that my house

my<br>tone ever since i discovered that you<br>can make a guitar sound good without<br>diming the treblebassgain and killing<br>the mids i also like to eat good food<br>and considering that my present<br>circumstance puts me in a situation<br>where half the time im by myself and the<br>other half the time i have my kiddo i go<br>way out of my way to make sure that i<br>can craft delicious meals not only for<br>myself but also for me and my daughter<br>on top of that i have a yard to maintain<br>i know that some of my friends here take<br>different stances when it comes to yard<br>mainte ce and i respect all of those<br>opinions im not hank hill when it comes<br>to my yard i dont want to have the best<br>yard in town i just want to make sure<br>that my yard looks somewhat presentable<br>yet also is inviting to the natural<br>aspects that yards attract pollinating<br>insects adorable fuzzy critters all that<br>shit i try to make my yard look clean<br>but i dont

earlier so it will<br>continue tomorrow warning suicide<br>ideation toxic workplace abusive parents<br>bear with me maybe long but maybe<br>necessary so that its clear if no one<br>replies maybe ill post it again in<br>another subreddit i just read and<br>watched from the internet that human<br>resources are more concerned with the<br>companys growth its image etc than with<br>the plight and wellbeing of employees in<br>fact human resources mentioned in the<br>beginning of the conversation that she<br>is trying to create projects for the<br>betterment of the company she is not a<br>direct indication that she might be<br>biased for the company but she also did<br>not say about what she could do for the<br>employees themselves she also<br>highlighted the importance of hard work<br>and the one i mentioned was one of my<br>complaints about having a workload for<br>people she replied by saying that the<br>positions are really multidisciplinary<br>nowadays tbf maybe since she was in a<br>hurry to leave at that point she only<br>thought it was variety of work instead<br>of workload amount but the latter was<br>said my people may be able to use what<br>you saidclaimed and use it against you<br>the thing is there is a scenario at work<br>but if i cannot trust human resources<br>since they are not really foremployees<br>like the labor union i dont want to<br>continue telling my story since it was<br>cut off our convo was due to time limit<br>so i was only able to say that they were<br>nice around the story because small talk<br>first caught me off guard and i forgot<br>warning of other online people about<br>human resources in general however maybe<br>wrong me good people exist after all<br>even in the most surprising of places in<br>fact one of the higher up bosses noticed<br>my depression so she told human<br>resources to reach out to me though to<br>be fair even this doesnt excuse the<br>toxicity of the company itself allowing<br>catcalling a supervisor throwing away<br>someones shoes etc and i need help i<br>dont have much money the salary is<br>correct and there is still debt to pay i<br>dont want to go back to abusive parents<br>and ive been feeling suicidal because<br>they dont want to regularize me and<br>comforting that my plan z is the end<br>instead of being a fat person or feel<br>the love language of my abuse again so<br>if human resources and other people have<br>my best interests that would be<br>beneficial the higher up supervisor even<br>told me that maybe human resources can<br>offer me a job to another sister company<br>to put everything in context this is<br>what happened during my work assessment<br>i had a minipanic attack when the words<br>my boss used were more fearinducing like<br>what will the higher ups say or what<br>will be our excuse when you wont meet<br>the quota i know its less intimidating<br>if you are not there tbf i only have<br>less than half of the tasks so maybe he<br>remembers that thats why hes slowing me<br>down what if im the second person to do<br>it but still you know why blame someone<br>for not meeting the quota if you know<br>the workload amount is for people or<br>would eventually be im also filled<br>because im giving r i heard her<br>complaints about me and she just brushed<br>them off she didnt even acknowledge them<br>in the end i couldnt bear my upset i<br>replied that i will talk to the higher<br>ups the next time she mentioned them i<br>also said that i would quit after saying<br>that i panicked bec i remembered my fi<br>cialfamily situation but i was too upset<br>to mitigate the damage i call it a<br>minipanic attack bec i became aggressive<br>with my behavior defensive mode and i<br>cannot seem return playing submissive i<br>also cried after boss left and i<br>attempted to knock on the literal<br>neighboring office different company and<br>ask for a job because i saw the<br>secretary there last time and she said<br>how kind her boss was and had even<br>recently offered a job to a family<br>friend that she hopes his boss lives for<br>a long time to help more people but when<br>i got there she was cold and adamant<br>that her boss was tired she also<br>reported me to my boss that i went to<br>them crying pls in the comments later i<br>already know my mistake pls be gentle i<br>feel ashamed and raw about it they later<br>told me that the secretaries boss was<br>sensitive i dont know if body or<br>emotions and didnt like surprise<br>meetings anyway boss implied that that<br>was the sign shes looking for since she<br>was undecided about me and said she also<br>didnt like my attitude during assessment<br>she said she would have given me the<br>regularization as long as i nodded and<br>said that i will do my best not her<br>exact words but along those lines but<br>she said i didnt do well with the<br>neighboring secretaries boss i feel so<br>ashamed im sorry everyone it seems like<br>a bad image to them and why do you think<br>i have anger issues i tried to explain<br>asked for a second chance but he said it<br>was too late because even the higher ups<br>have already agreed with the decision im<br>so upset and wanna go absent without<br>leave but my coworkers convinced me to<br>wait for the last pay and certificate of<br>experience i went half day the day i was<br>told and one of my friends heard the<br>comment of my wanting to kill myself he<br>took me seriously it seemed because my<br>vibe was pretty gloomy then suddenly<br>many calls and texts sent to me he told<br>the whole office in his panic the next<br>day was normal since i explained via<br>text to my panicked friend to calm down<br>i know my boss knows but she doesnt<br>mention it so thats the whole story the<br>question is it safe to tell hr will my<br>saying so benefit future employees in<br>regards to mental health i told him but<br>not everything i havent mentioned around<br>the part when i knocked on the<br>neighboring office i also mentioned my<br>panic attack and when she asked me if<br>ive experienced it before i said yes i<br>said that my parents were the cause of<br>my panic attacks before

story the next time we<br>meet what will i say this human<br>resources spans more than one company so<br>he is busy and its not like my coworkers<br>intheknow would care enough to narrate<br>to human
