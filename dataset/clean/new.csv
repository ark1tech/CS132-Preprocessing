2024-04-21 15:32:18,Text-only,Canâ€™t stay even for a minute longer!,"Iâ€™m a nurse working for almost a year sa isang govâ€™t hosp. The first month was really good for me since napakahealthy nung ward na una kong pinasukan, I was never absent if Iâ€™m not sick or had important appointments, I was never late kahit na wala naman akong sweldo as a volunteer but then I was transferred the next month to the surgical ward. Everything went downhill from there.  My confidence as a nurse. My work-life balance. My happiness. My love for nursing. My mental health. I became miserable so fast I couldnâ€™t hold on to save myself. The workload was bearable but the coworkers was the worst. They were ganging up on me, even sa pinakamaliit na bagay pinapalaki nila but when their friends make the same mistakes that I do, they donâ€™t bat an eye about it. information technology was clear that I was being bullied but I had to be strong sa ganitong work environment pero information technology lead me to go have myself get checked by a psychologist. Umiiyak ako before and after work. Kinakabahan kapag tumutunog yung phone ko. Nanlalamig kapag umaapak na sa hospital. 4hours max lang yung tulog ko may duty or wala.  Now, Iâ€™m resigning after months of enduring the toxicity of my work environment. Gusto kong magâ€™Immediate Resignation, kasi hindi ko na talaga kayang tumagal doon ng kahit isang minuto pa. Needed po ba talaga sa Public hospitals na magrender kahit isang week before umalis? And also, ayokong ilagay na Toxic work environment sa resignation ko since information technology might bounce back to my record if ever lilipat ako ng ibang hospital. Is Personal reasons enough po ba to immediate resign? Or should I put that its because of my mental health? I just want to run away from that place immediately. Need opinions po and advice. Thank you. ","Canâ€™t stay even for a minute longer! Iâ€™m a nurse working for almost a year sa isang govâ€™t hosp.

2024-04-21 15:23:45,Text-only,5 vacation leaves in a year,"Ilan ba talaga ang vacation leave ng regular employee in a year? I know someone who works sa Jollibee na walang vacation leave kahit regular ka na after 6 months. Magkakaron ka lang ng vacation leave once naka-one year ka na sakanila & 5 vacation leaves lang yun. Tapos most of the time pa, youâ€™re not allowed na mag request ng off mo. May instances na 7 consecutive days ang night shift, isang off tapos may pasok agad. Is this even legal? or is this something Department of Labor and Employment should know? ","5 vacation leaves in a year Ilan ba talaga ang vacation leave ng regular employee in a year?

2023-12-27 06:04:42,Text-only,Terminated and No Pay,"Hi so last November 3, I sent my resignation letter together with the last IDs of a certain school, later my boss begged me to stay and wants me to do other school IDs, I made a mistake and did all of that. Up until December 13, I was already expecting to receive my payment but no, what I got is another school ID I need to work on then sabi di ko gagawin yun. December 25 I asked for my payment then he said na di daw ibibigay pag hindi ko gagawin yung IDs, I refused then sabi niya terminated ako and no pay. This all happened in a messenger chat. Do I have any shot for this? Also I have already documented this with screenshots, I don't know if I can upload information technology here.","Terminated and No Pay Hi so last November 3, I sent my resignation letter together with the last IDs of a certain school, later my boss begged me to stay and wants me to do other school IDs, I made a mistake and did all of that.
