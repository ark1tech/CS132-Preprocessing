This thread is not a brag thread but maybe give an insight on how to find the opportunity to get that amount of pay while being respected and not worked to the bone.  A little history, I'm 32. Live in cebu, and single with my own place and 2 cars. I am in the information technology industry. I didnt graduate, I stopped going to school when I was in first year. My po When I got my first job when I was 19, my bi-weekly pay then was only 4,000 pesos. barely to get by but information technology was okay with me because I lived with my mom. Back then, I already realized that working for local companies won't be worth my time.  That's when I decided to utang my first laptop and started to learn web design and development. Every free waking moment that I had I dedicated information technology to honing those skills. I uploaded my god-awful designs on imgur and just sent those to people looking for designs here in reddit.  My first client asked me to create a logo for $35. Not much but information technology gave me some funds on my paypal to buy a domain and host my portfolio. Having your own portfolio website separates you from the other freelancers and is a big leg up.  I was still working on my shitty job, but I then applied to Convergys as a call center agent. I spent a year there while still browsing design websites and learning photoshop on the side.  My pay here is 7,000 bi-weekly.  The third company that I got hired at was a call center company again but I was the ""web developer"" then. creating internal tools for their agents. They pay me 11,000 bi-weekly but I had to opportunity to use the office computer after my shift. My shift would end at 5am but stay in the office until 12 noon to work on my freelance projects. I did this everyday, even weekend for a year and a half until I was able to save up 50,000 to get my own place at 21 and move out.  I bought my own PC, and went full-time freelancing, and by the second year of being a full-time freelancer. I was able to get a high-end sedan and move to a better apartment, have enough savings to weather me for 6 months and was able to pay off the sedan in 10 months. Got my second car at 24 then.  I guess my point here is that local companies will fuck you over with any chance they can because at the end of the day, the bottom line is more important to them than their employees. international clients, especially if you have a great track record will respect you more because they can see your value and trust that you will do the right thing.  A couple of freelancing tips:   have an amazing portfolio and actually be good at what you do learn english. this is very important, there are other designers and developers than are way better than me but what companies want to hire me is because I can speak conversational english ALWAYS ask for 50% of the total project. The times that I didnt always bit me in the ass.  NEVER be afraid to ask more. The more you charge, the more clients will respect you because big rates mean you are worth it.  always ask for the pay FIRST when talking to recruiters on linkedin. dont go through the employment process if they dont tell you because they want to pay the cheapest price that they can.  dont work for local companies.   ​ hopefully you get something out of this thread, and if you have any questions. feel free.","I made 600,000 pesos for 1 month and 2 weeks of work while working from home.

Ewan ko ba kung bakit di rinereport ng media, eh napakaextravagant ng mga ito. Hindi na makatarungan eh, considering that we the taxpayers pay for these. Was compiling this data for my journalism thesis. I'm dropping my findings in the table below with four columns: Column 1 - Agency or Institution (*** means in the top 10) Column 2 - Number of employees (permanent + temporary + contractual). I did not include job order or contract of service employees because they are not paid from the “personnel services” line item.

In fact, na-mention ni human resources in the beginning  ng usapan that she's trying to create projects for the betterment of the company. Hindi sya direct indication na she might be biased for the company, pero hindi rin nya nasabi about what she could do for the employees themselves.  Na-highlight nya rin ang importance of hard work. And yung namention ko ang isa sa mga reklamo ko about having a workload for 2 people, she replied by saying that multi-disciplinary talaga ang positions nowadays.  Tbf, baka, since nagmamadali na syang umalis at that point, akala nya lang variety of work, instead of workload amount, pero yung latter ang sinasabi ko.  People may be able to use what you said/claimed, and gamitin ito against you. The thing is may  gyaring scenario sa work. But if I cannot trust human resources since hindi sila for-employee talaga kagaya ng Labor Union, I don't want to continue telling my story since naputol nga convo namin due to time limit.  So around 1/4 of the story lang ang nasabi ko. (Ang nice nila kasi, small talk muna, caught me off guard and I forgot warning of other online-people about human resources in general) However, baka mali me. Good people exist after all, even in the most surprising of places. In fact, yung one of the higher up bosses ang naka-notice ng depression ko, so she told human resources to reach out to me.  Though, to be fair, even this doesn't excuse the toxicity of the company itself (allowing catcalling, a supervisor throwing away someone's shoes, etc.) And kelangan ko ng tulong. I don't have much money (sakto ang sweldo and may binabayaran pang utang), ayoko bumalik sa abusadong mga magulang, and I've been feeling suicidal, because ayaw nila akong i-regularize, and comforting na ang Plan Z ko ay ""the end"" imbis na maging taong grasa, or maramdaman uli ang love language ng  ay ko: abuso. So, if human resources and other people have my best interests, that would be beneficial. The higher up supervisor even told me na baka human resources can offer me a job to another sister company. To put everything in context, ito ang  gyari: During my work assessment, I had a mini-panic attack when the words my boss used were more fear-inducing like ""What will the higher ups say? Or what will be our excuse when you won't meet the quota?"" (I know, it's less intimidating pag wala ka dun) Tbf, less than half pa lang ang tasks na nasa akin, so baka nag-aaalala sya na yun palang nababagalan sya sa akin, pano pag pang-dalawa tao na yung gagawin ko. But still, you know. Why blame someone for not meeting the quota if you know the workload amount is for 2 people, or would eventually be? Napuno rin ako kasi binibigyan ko naman ng rason yung mga complaints nya sa akin, and bina-brush off nya lang, di nya ina-acknowledge man lang. In the end, di ko natiis yung upset ko, sumagot ako ng ako na yung kakausap sa mga higher ups, the next time she mentioned them. Sabi ko rin magki-quit ako.  After saying that, I panicked bec. naalala ko ang fi cial-family situation ko, but I was too upset to mitigate the damage.  I call information technology a mini-panic attack bec. naging aggressive ako with my behavior (defensive mode) and I cannot seem return playing submissive.  Umiyak din ako after boss left, and I attempted to knock on the literal neighboring office (different company), and ask for a job.  Na-chika ko kasi yung secretary dun last time and she said how sobrang bait ng boss nya and had even recently offered a job to a family friend. That she hopes his boss lives for a long time to help more people. Pero pag dating ko dun, she was cold and adamant that her boss was tired. Sinumbong nya rin ako sa boss ko, na umiiyak akong pumunta sa kanila. Pls, in the comments later, I already know my mistake, pls be gentle. I feel ashamed and raw about it.  They later told me that the secretary's boss was sensitive (I don't know if body or emotions) and didn't like surprise meetings. Anyway, boss implied that that was the sign she's looking for since she was undecided about me, and said she also didn't like my attitude during assessment.  Ibibigay nya daw sana sa akin ang regularization as long as tumango daw ako and say that I will do my best. Not her exact words, but along those lines.  Pero di daw maganda ginawa ko with the neighboring secretary's boss (I feel so ashamed, I'm sorry, everyone. -_-) parang bad image sa kanila, and bakit daw parang may anger issues ata ako.  I tried to explain. Asked for a second chance. But sabi niya too late kasi kahit ang higher ups ay agree na sa decision.

Tapos biglang maraming calls and texts sent to me. He told the whole office in his panic. The next day was normal naman since I explained via text to my panicked friend to calm down. I know my boss knows but she doesn't mention it.  So that's the whole story.

Di ko pa nababanggit around the part nung kumatok ako sa neighboring office.  Namention ko na din panic attack ko, and when she asked me if I've experienced information technology before, I said yes. Nasabi ko na parents ko ang dahilan ng panic attack ko dati bec. they have a toxic personality style.

And if I decided not to tell the whole story the next time we meet what will I say?

2023-07-07 20:24:23,Text-only,Is Universal Basic Income the Ultimate Anti-Work?,"I think information technology is time for me to start a new discussion, here at AntiWorkPH subreddit. In one of the highly contested threads (Yea, I admit information technology got heated since I was very active on my part. But I digress) The topic is the Universal Basic Income, which I'll call UBI for the entire duration of my responses in this thread will be. \^ Here is the reference, I hope and I appeal for everyone to watch the video first before posting a response and comment so we are all on the same page. In a capitalist system, there will always be low paying jobs, there is no escape with it. I've been very vocal for saying the only solution regarding low paying jobs is just to actually leave that low paying job and move to a higher paying job (for whatever legal way possible of course). Easily said than done, I fully admit. However, this UBI system has been debated by economists, very good concept on paper but a lot of dark undertones that can cause more trouble than good vs our current capitalist society. UBI's implementation cancels the very fabric of the elites, the top 1%, ok let's just say the top 10% of the world population with their immense collective wealth will have to fund it. I'm  sure kung lahat ng working age adults may automatic pera at regular intervals to cover all basic expenses para mabuhay, macacancel na finally ang need to have AntiWork as a subreddit here lol. However, doing so, the elites will not only lose their wealth but their goons and political clout as well. Why serve the elites as part of the ""goons"", e kaya ko naman ng bilhin lahat ng basic needs ko (collapse of the global security sector). Why follow the leadership of ""X"" (who belongs to the elites, most political clan members are in the top percentile of the population) they are just self-serving elites, and I don't need them to eat, sleep, have clothing and roof over my head (the collapse of political structure). As you can see the current society as we built since the ancient Mesopotamia will collapse. With the elites also having UBI only, and they have to start from scratch again, who will fund UBI for the long term? information technology is really a conundrum, if we leave information technology to entities we call governments, UBI is not UBI but rather information technology morphs into a system we all hate to see in our lives, communism. Now guys, again please watch the video and discuss information technology here with me. This very topic really fits the concept and context of Antiwork. We work right now to meet first our basic needs, then the rest of our wants as per Maslow's hierarchy of needs. Ano mangyayari sa Maslow's kung naka UBI na, at gaano tatagal ito bago gumuho due to lacking of funding long term?","Is Universal Basic Income the Ultimate Anti-Work?

2023-04-01 21:25:53,Text-only,I am happy kasi the industry I am working is not that competitive,"I work in the information technology Infrastracture/Operations(IT Support, Network, SysAd) field. This is my 4th job, and from what I have observed based on my personal experience, this particular information technology field is not that competitive compared to other industries. Sa Business process outsourcing call center industry kasi for example, some companies are so strict with performance metrics. Kaya nagiging toxic na yung environment because people are dragging others down. It's survival to the fittest.They will bully you, torture you mentally and emotionally, to the point na mag reresign ka kasi inggit sila dahil mataas yung performance mo. Others will sexually seduce their team leader and OMs(or vice versa) to compensate on their poor performance and attendance.

This is my 4th job, and from what I have observed based on my personal experience, this particular information technology field is not that competitive compared to other industries. Sa Business process outsourcing call center industry kasi for example, some companies are so strict with performance metrics. Kaya nagiging toxic na yung environment because people are dragging others down. It's survival to the fittest.They will bully you, torture you mentally and emotionally, to the point na mag reresign ka kasi inggit sila dahil mataas yung performance mo. Others will sexually seduce their team leader and OMs(or vice versa) to compensate on their poor performance and attendance.

2023-06-13 07:17:11,Text-only,Please cut us unwilling slaves some slack,"I'll preface this post by stating that originally I was going to post this on my personal Facebook, however given the amount of business contacts that I have on my friends list along with other people and my friends list who are either potential clients or otherwise ill-informed vapid capitalists, I decided otherwise only because I'm not willing to sacrifice my abilities to sustain my family to speak my mind. I know that it's a fine line but for the time being, I'm not willing to cross information technology but I feel like a lot of people here can resonate with this, especially those in the level of management or those who own small businesses in order to make ends meet. This is going to be a rant and I'm not pouting or asking for pity so if you think that's what I'm doing, just erase that notion from your mind if you even take the time to read this. A lot of people ask me why I don't ""go out"". Why I don't go to bars, why don't go to house parties, why at the very most I make short-term social appearances at gatherings, and why for the most part that I spend my free time in my home doing whatever the hell information technology is that I do. So first off, let's address the whole concept of ""whatever information technology is that I do"" The first and most obvious thing is that I take care of my house to the best of my abilities. I keep things clean, I make sure the dishes are clean, I make sure the floors are clean, and make sure the bathroom is clean, and I make sure that my house is somewhat presentable especially because I have a kiddo and a kiddo should never ever have to live in a dump. I also have my own passions and my own pleasures and my own enjoyments. If you know me, you know that I love playing guitar. And if you're a guitar player, you know that not only am I a guitar player but I'm also a tone chaser. It's one of my passions. I've been after my ""tone"" ever since I discovered that you can make a guitar sound good without diming the treble/bass/gain and killing the mids. I also like to eat good food. And considering that my present circumstance puts me in a situation where half the time I'm by myself and the other half the time, I have my kiddo, I go way out of my way to make sure that I can craft delicious meals not only for myself but also for me and my daughter. On top of that. I have a yard to maintain. I know that some of my friends here take different stances when information technology comes to yard mainte ce and I respect all of those opinions. I'm not Hank Hill when information technology comes to my yard. I don't want to have the best yard in town. I just want to make sure that my yard looks somewhat presentable yet also is inviting to the natural aspects that yards attract; pollinating insects, adorable fuzzy critters, all that shit. I try to make my yard look clean but I don't go to the extreme of making information technology look manicured to the point of winning some sort of stupid lawn award. I'm also a human. I require a minimal amount of sleep during every solar cycle to make sure that my body and my mind can heal and recharge and be prepared for the hurdles of the next day. So let's discuss the hurdles of the next day. I'm a manager. I don't just manage one specific aspect of a business. I manage the entire fucking aspect. The fi cial aspect, the customer service aspect, the human resources aspect, inventory, productivity, everything. I literally manage every single aspect of keeping the body shop that I am an integral part of running. Paperwork, making sure that people are getting a fair wage, making sure that the customers are getting way more than they pay for, making sure that my vendors are able to supply the commodities necessary to make sure that day-to-day operations can run smoothly without having unrealistic expectations of them, making sure that calls get answered and voicemails get returned. At the end of the day, 9 times out of 10, I'm fucking tired. Not just physically, not just mentally, not just emotionally. It's the unholy trifecta. And what's fucked up is that there's not 10 days in the week but rather seven.   Work = 45 hours a week Commune = 10 hours a week Getting ready = 5 hours a week  That's 60 hours a week minimum to make sure that I can make a fair and honest living in order to support my daughter, pay my bills, and fi cially cover my obligations. I'm not bitching about money. This isn't about money. This is about time. 36% of my time alive is dedicated to my career. I'm not bitching about that. What I am bitching about is people expecting me to be able to perform at peak performance when information technology comes to social functions outside of work. 36% is a lot closer to 50% than 25% and you better believe that when information technology comes to being a parent and being a responsible employee/employer, I give both of those tasks my all. I know this was long-winded, but information technology serves a purpose. If the people that you know seem like they're burnt out or not up to the task of socializing at the same pace that you are, don't give them grief for it. We all recharge in different ways. We all should be able to set aside some time for ourselves along with time for the people that we give a fuck about. And sometimes it's hard to find that balance. We're all obligated to work for an income in order to sustain the lives that we live and that will never change in the foreseeable future. But you know what can change? This fucked up notion that people have unlimited amounts of energy on reserve. Because we don't. We get older. We get tired. We get exhausted. And that's not just a physical thing. It's also a mental thing. It's also an emotional thing. I don't give a fuck if you cut me in general some slack, but as a whole, cut people some slack. Sometimes we just got to do the whole fucking ""bed-rotting"" routine. Sometimes we just need to sit in the living room with our cats and watch TV. Sometimes we need to sit out back around a fire by ourselves and sort our thoughts out. Sometimes we need to pick up a guitar and play without anyone else in the room. Sometimes we need to pick up a controller and immerse ourselves in a fantasy world on the television. And sometimes we need to read a book and sometimes we need to just stare at a wall and not even fucking think. Life is fucked and not everybody is cut from the same cloth.","Please cut us unwilling slaves some slack I'll preface this post by stating that originally I was going to post this on my personal Facebook, however given the amount of business contacts that I have on my friends list along with other people and my friends list who are either potential clients or otherwise ill-informed vapid capitalists, I decided otherwise only because I'm not willing to sacrifice my abilities to sustain my family to speak my mind.

2022-10-27 22:07:51,Text-only,Ghosting why information technology happens and how to cope,"Prelude Before anything else. Please gather some confidence to read this. I'll tell you, I can't help myself not filter what really happens in the background as the recruiter. By The Way this is a long-post. Thus the prelude. --- Introduction I've been seeing a lot of posts about being ghosted by a recruiter. Be information technology they didn't call back after signing a job offer, no calls after the technical-or-initial interview, or worst, no call at all. Yes, I know information technology sucks to be treated that way. I personally been in your situation when starting my career and even during my early job hopping experience. Guess what, I didn't dwell on information technology nor asked what company is information technology for me to avoid it. I applied and they were even the ones chasing me. Yes, the people/company you hated were the ones chasing me. So what's the difference between you and me? And please all of these are hypothetical, so if information technology hits you and you get triggered, sleep on information technology first so you'd comprehend. --- Why does ghosting happen? When you apply, what happens is that a recruiter will read your CV. Then check on available job posts for a cross-match even if you did information technology yourself. They might reach out and call you, to get some details so it's up to you what you can disclose. Basically, your profile gets deprioritized and simply put rejected. I know and completely understand you'd want to hear the rejection from them. But if you received a failed response and your peers with identical skill sets as you knew, they won't apply there anymore. --- So why is your profile getting deprioritized? There's only one reason why. There's someone better than you. Or better put, there's someone else who can do the job without much training needed. Despite the salary requirements. Now you would tell me, I need a job and I can't build that experience without a job, so how can I compete? You upskill yourself. It's 2022 today and most skill literature is shared on Youtube, Tiktok, etc. So instead of mopping around you got rejected or coping with the rejection by playing games and being unproductive. By The Way just gives more reason not to hire you. You need to discipline yourself to match the job. You're the one asking for the job right, so know what's needed to get the job. --- My personal experience, as an applicant (when I started) This is my personal experience when I started looking for a job. Nope, not the present when most jobs can't afford to hire me. I've applied to a hundred jobs or basically run a shotgun to what jobs are available with the keyword ""Java"". Of the 100, only 30 initially interviewed me, then only 20 proceed to a technical interview and only 10 made a job offer. As for the 70 postings who ghosted me, I didn't care to ask why. Oh, I did experience a dry spell wherein all 50 applications turned 0 interviews. What's the reason for giving me the offer? information technology was simply I was the right man for the job. And ironically, I was one ghosting those 9 job offers. Why, for the same reason, I deprioritized them. All for a company that values my skills and career growth. --- My personal experience as a recruiter  I've been a recruiter for 9 years. Been an information technology programmer for 10 years before retiring. So handling 100+ CVs a day while meeting the target key performance indices and only having 2 hours to scheme them all, just imagine how many CVs are left unread and ghosted. Look, am not proud of information technology even am sharing it. See the picture. And yes, when I got the chance to catch up, there are good applicants that I'd missed as they already have taken a job. Add in my hourly limit as a recruiter for just 10 hours a week as I need to run 40 hours on the main job, it's hard to read all CVs and interview them (which By The Way takes 1-2 hours for a skills interview). You get the picture. --- My proposal to combat ghosting Since am I became a part-time recruiter and a programmer. I programmed an application tracking system or HRIS for that agency. Yes, we still encode the data and all, but all recruiters were able to keep a track of all applicants and what's their status. We even sent an email notification only for rejection. But the best part, we get scolded by the hiring manager because he gets notified that this applicant has been left in the ""For initial interview"" after 3 days. Did that help? In my perspective, yes! Then again, not all recruitment agency has the same budget for one nor have a centralized way to store/update applicant status. --- How should you cope? The answer is simple. You submit your application, but don't expect a reply. Treat your application as done and rejected. I know that's kinda doing reverse psychology to yourself. But information technology helps change your mindset from chasing the company to letting the company chase you. And the same applies to every step of your application. And what if there's no one interviewing you? Then you need to upskill. I've said information technology before, your current skills aren't a match, or better yet, there's someone better than you and more qualified. So start investing in your skills. --- How to deal with recruiters/companies who are known to a ghosts? Actually, nothing. Just hit apply like you didn't apply. And if they called you, good, but don't expect any. Again this is the let them chase you mindset and not you chasing the company.  --- Why need to change your mindset? It's simple, to value your worth. And am going to touch a bit about low-balling. Most applicants who get a verbal offer intuitively accept the offer before reviewing it. And when they post here to review, they get dumbfounded that it's a low salary for that position. And information technology pains to see their excited faces turn to frustration. That's you chasing the company mindset. Now if you start the let the company chase you, and they gave you an offer below your accepting rate, you can decline. You'd be surprised that there will be offers that will give-in to your asking salary consdiering you really are worth the rate. And with the prices going up due to inflation and all, well now you know.","Ghosting why information technology happens and how to cope Prelude Before anything else.

Boom! information technology was all black.  ​ I mean, I didn't turn my camera on. Lol. So, I checked the link directly, and yes, information technology was all correct. ​ At 3:00 AM, S**** joined in, which means I joined first, and she came in next. ​ She said: ​ ""Good morning and thank you, *****, for hopping on this preliminary interview with Hikinex. I'm the executive hiring specialist.  I'll be shadowing this preliminary interview. A talent specialist will join us as well."" ​ Yes, you read information technology right, Hikinex. Sounds like highly intelligent knowledge, right? Laughing out loud But I had some research on my sleeve. I did my company research. Which I think makes me more highly intelligent than them. LOL. ​ After a while, J******* came in, the talent specialist, and greeted us. They asked my consent to record the Zoom meeting, which I gave. Then J******* asked me: ​ ""Can you briefly tell me more about yourself?"" ​ I answered: ​ ​ ""How do you create SEO content?"" ​ This question got me thinking. ​ So I answered: ​ ""Well, I usually follow a certain checklist to create content, whether it's about an SEO article or writing SEO-friendly articles. To briefly walk you through, I need to ask my clients for the content brief. From there, I draw lines on what needs to be done and what needs to be accomplished first. Like, keyword research. And of course, after everything is written, I need to get my client's approval. Plus, I put that on the system that my client intends me to use. One example is WordPress.""

I never opted-in applying for the position. ​ ​ I received a message from Andy Jiminez, your co-founding chief executive officer on LinkedIn, and he invited me for a quick call, which I religiously accepted. ​ So, information technology piqued my interest to attend this quick call, and I never expected that it's going to be a panel of interviews.

And from that, I can draw a ballpark figure, around 60k pesos per month. ​ But hear me out: ​ As a freelance copywriter, the value and conversions I bring to the table are three times greater than my monthly salary. ​ Say, one article costs $250 and one case study project costs $800, which is what I expect. ​ However, please do not worry as this is merely my expectation. Ultimately, I am focused on implementation and action, J*******. ​ She seemed content with my response and asked if I had any questions, to which I respectfully obliged. ​ ""Thank you, J*******.

But other asian or african nationalities don't call themselves expats when they work in a foreign country(in general). We are labelled Overseas Filipino Workers when we work abroad or migrant workers. But both terms generally mean ""foreign workers"" . If youre brown- migrant worker, if youre white- expat. I checked some sites and I asked chatgpt the difference between the two terms and here is the generated answer. - Expats (Expatriates): The term ""expat"" typically refers to individuals who voluntarily choose to live and work abroad temporarily or permanently. They often relocate for various reasons such as job opportunities, career advancement, lifestyle preferences, or personal circumstances. Expats often enjoy certain privileges and benefits, such as higher income, company-provided accommodations, and support networks. They may maintain strong ties to their home country and have the intention of returning eventually. Migrant Workers: On the other hand, the term ""migrant workers"" refers to individuals who move to another country primarily for employment opportunities. Migrant workers often come from countries with lower economic opportunities and seek better livelihoods abroad. They may face challenges such as language barriers, exploitation, limited legal protections, and social integration difficulties. Migrant workers often perform lower-skilled jobs and may have limited access to the benefits and privileges that expats enjoy. - But then again not all migrant workers perform lower skilled jobs and not all foreign workers are from third world countries. South Korea is a first world country, but when they work outside of they home country they dont go around calling themselves expats or no one dare label them expats cause ykyk.","Why don't we call (US)americans who work in the Philippines Overseas American workers instead of expats?

That’s 78 hours. Instead of working 8 days (40 hours per week) we worked 7 days + 8 hours holiday pay. I know for a fact I worked the whole 7 days, I clocked in and out but “the system” shows I didn’t clock out 3-4 separate times in May which I know is an error. I since told 2 supervisors, contacted Payroll and told them in person.

Nowadays, I just don’t talk to anyone because everyone kisses each other’s behind. I stay away from that. I have social anxiety but that doesn’t stop me from doing my job and that doesn’t stop me from speaking up when something happens. But it’s the lack of empathy and lack of understanding that makes me NEVER speak up on what happens to me. And now of all things…I have to deal with lost wages?

No hate naman sa mga FAs kasi I have applied for a life insurance myself din naman, pero some of my friends na FAs, most of the time they flex a lot about their vacations, investments, and all.  I know a bit on how a career in fi cial advising works because nabiktima din ako ng “internship sa insurance companies” where I applied as an intern tapos they made me somewhat a recruiter. They even told me to take an exam (nakalimutan ko tawag) pero hindi ko tinake.  I know this job is based on commissions talaga, so if walang mainsure, walang makukuha. Please correct me nalang po if I’m wrong. Then siguro, doon ko din napag isip isip na kaya siguro some of them are quite persistent when information technology comes to offering fi cial advising and life insurance is because kailangan nila ng commission, which is completely understandable because lahat naman tayo nagttrabaho to earn money.  But anyway, ayun nga. I always feel na mas may nararating sila as compared to someone like me na stuck lang sa office work and repetitive lang ang ginagawa. Sometimes iniisip ko, what if I changed my career path into that? Would my life be any different than what information technology is now? They always encourage people to join their team, to start their career with them—just so we can enjoy perks like free flights abroad, be able to buy high-end laptops, and invest in condos or cars.  Again, this is not a hate post directed towards them, but I am just genuinely curious if they really make a lot in that field.","Is fi cial advising a good career?

Here's what makes my blood boil pa, that day, pagka-out, nagawa nyang magsabi sa 2 co-workers ko na may changes sa schedule nila the next day. F*ck that, nagawa nyang magsabi maaga sa kanila but sa akin less than 2 human resources before? I feel disrepected sa sudden change of schedule and parang pinaparating nya na ako pa mali na hindi ko nabasa yung message nya.  Is information technology really protocol na 2 human resources before (whereas less than 2 human resources pa nga) magsabi? Because information technology felt wrong.

2023-03-14 19:55:07,Text-only,Thought that I will be able to get through but nope,"For context, I posted here some time ago about having to make a change in the current system as a Fresh Grad. I just really wanted to start my first work in a small company because I wasn't really confident with my skills when I was in a big company during my internship and was hoping that at least if I can make a change in a small company, I'll get noticed and eventually climb the ranks. I also just realized the online courses I took really helped address my weaknesses. So, what happened is that, I entered a small company with skills I can say is above average. The problem is, with a different view of the business and an experience from a big company, I get to notice the incompetence of the people in my workplace especially in my field (marketing) and information technology frustrates me everyday. The first two weeks, I was so determined to make a pitch to them to fix the system and give them a solution for their marketing problems. I was initially able to formulate a campaign but then I thought of a bigger strategy, one which is for the long term brand health based on a competitive analysis I made for them. Was eager to make a research for them to strengthen my strategy but was denied of the opportunity. Now, I'm stuck with an incompetent management that don't plan their strategy ahead and uses mainly gut instincts.

It's a bad move!","Thought that I will be able to get through but nope For context, I posted here some time ago about having to make a change in the current system as a Fresh Grad. I just really wanted to start my first work in a small company because I wasn't really confident with my skills when I was in a big company during my internship and was hoping that at least if I can make a change in a small company, I'll get noticed and eventually climb the ranks. I also just realized the online courses I took really helped address my weaknesses. So, what happened is that, I entered a small company with skills I can say is above average. The problem is, with a different view of the business and an experience from a big company, I get to notice the incompetence of the people in my workplace especially in my field (marketing) and information technology frustrates me everyday. The first two weeks, I was so determined to make a pitch to them to fix the system and give them a solution for their marketing problems. I was initially able to formulate a campaign but then I thought of a bigger strategy, one which is for the long term brand health based on a competitive analysis I made for them. Was eager to make a research for them to strengthen my strategy but was denied of the opportunity. Now, I'm stuck with an incompetent management that don't plan their strategy ahead and uses mainly gut instincts. They set unreasonable deadlines since when they think of an idea, they want immediate output like As Soon As Possible and all they think about is profits. Currently I have experienced asking for permits to process within the day which is filed also that same day even if information technology usually takes 3 days for the proper proceds.

I am currently working as a Data Scientist for an MNC HQ-ed in Silicon Valley, and I am earning roughly 4M annually or 300k per month gross total (as in lahat na: base, allowances, bonus, benefits etc). The job is of course aligned sa shift ng Silicon Valley, full night shift. The 'problem' is that the job and the tasks are so boring and degrading ng talino, tipong instead of creating Machine Learning models or doing AI, gumagawa lang ako ng reports at dashboards. Worse, ako na rin nag engineering at architect ng datasets na kailangan ko kasi incompetent yung Data Engg team namin na dapat nag pproductionize nito. To add to the issue, my manager, is a self-claimed technical person pero hindi naman marunong mag model ng data. Magaling lang mamulitika which is a boon or a curse, depende on which side of the fence you sit. Pero between us, mostly sa results lang siya nakatingin. Hindi unique sakin yung ganitong approach niya, and kahit na 5 kami sa team, lahat ng tao ganito trato niya. In short, wala, hindi aligned sa job description at job title yung ginagawa ko, aka glorified Business Analyst ako, tapos yung supposed manager ko na technical at nakakaintindi sana ng Data Science, hanash niya lang na technical person siya. I feel I'm at a crossroad where I have to pick between salary and sustainable growth. Worried ako sa future job prospects ko when shit hits the fan aka ilay-off ako or need ko na lumipat due to life circumstances, kasi Data Scientist ako dapat pero wala naman akong ginagawang ML/AI tapos ang taas na ng bayad sakin agad. I also tried applying locally and internationally. Locally, the moment they hear my current pay nag aauto-pass sila. Some interviews na nag-lie na ako na binabaan ko na and mayroon narin na I told them I am more than willing to take a 50% paycut. Internationally naman, everyone is either requiring you to have right to work in their countries, or night shift pa rin here in the Philippines-- which is not sustainable in the long run, health-wise? Hindi pa rin factored dito na yung peers ko in local companies ay senior managers and directors na with influence in their own circles and leading their own set of people na. I guess it's nice to have that level of influence in your career. Individual contributor pa rin ako, glorified analyst level talaga ang turing sakin. I just don't know though if commensurate ba yung pay nila sa title, or if same pay lang din kami kahit hindi ako at the manager/director level pa. Some people were joking or saying na almost VP na raw kasi yung sweldo ko kaya ako nahihirapan humanap.

This will be her 3rd missed payroll by Friday. What rights does she hold with this situation? information technology seems that the employer is delaying her wages intentionally. We assume their American counterparts are paid on time. Their managers are also clueless that they are unpaid.  Take note they have direct contact with the owner and the owner's assistant. information technology seems that they are the only ones who know about this since the owner keeps delaying and mentioning he will take care of information technology to no avail. My girlfriend and her other fellow Filipino recruiter have managed to hit targets proposed to them. However they keep beating around the bush when it's time to send the payment via PayPal.  She is already feeling unmotivated and would like to stop logging in for work next Monday but she's concerned that they will not give her her rightful wages if she does so. She feels trapped and is already unmotivated. Hope someone helps. Any advice will be greatly appreciated.

But they cut off all access to communication channels. Is this normal?  I was wondering how am I supposed to accomplish the entire offboarding process if they remove information technology before then? Can someone please help enlighten regarding the entire process? I don't mind following instructions, if they've provided any. Edited: Just wanted to add a few details. I understand if information technology is corporate policy, but how do I accomplish and move forward with the entire offboarding process? If not, the process afterwards.  I didn't leave the company. I sent a letter to my bosses, and got an approval. I followed all instructions the human resources team provided during one of our discussions a few days ago. When I brought up my case, they were even ones to suggest the date I put on my letter. I even shared that if my immediate resignation would not be approved, I wouldn't mind taking the 30-day rendering period.  But they actually approved it. And yet, they never provided any instructions regarding the entire process. I didn't just leave, I didn't AWOL. The entire resignation had been properly communicated and I sought advice from the human resources team. I was not properly informed.  I don't care that the email access to the company had been cut off. I care about where the communication now will take place since information technology is cut off. Because at the moment, they haven't reached out. I am really hoping if anyone can provide/shed a light regarding this process. ** I don't understand why people here antagonize those who are leaving. I am seeking advice and information that I didn't get from the human resources team. And since information technology was already clarified, because again, not everyone has ample information technology knowledge, and they were actually sending all details in the company's account - instructions, documents to fill out, I was surprised when information technology was cut off.  I was worried because if I had not seen the file (one of their checklists)  on my company's email account, I wouldn't have been able to accomplish it. I am afraid information technology will be used against me  - that I had failed to complete their requirements.  I never reached out at first because they specifically mentioned that someone will be contacting me.  By The Way I left because I was harrassed.

2023-09-08 14:14:07,Text-only,Should I sue my former boss?,"For context, I just got hired like a week ago. During my interview in this company, I was honest that I don’t have proper experience in the field yet I’m willing to learn. After the initial interview, I was called for a final interview. After that I did not hear back from them for almost 10 days, and I already thought that I did not make it. After 10 days, I received the job offer via email. I was shocked because of my lack of experience, but I accepted information technology thinking I’ll be trained for the job anyways. My first day at the job and it’s a wreck already since the one who’s supposed to be training me is not there, so I we just met virtually and I just did some menial tasks. The days after that are the same, even if she’s training me information technology does not seem enough because I still have many questions and technically I’m still new to the job.  Today, I made a mistake at work. I admit that information technology was my mistake on my end since I’m still adjusting but yeah this afternoon my boss talked to me and said that I don’t have enough experience for the job and that they will let me go. I was dumbfounded at first but yeah I said okay since I can’t do anything about it. When I told my officemates that I was terminated they all said that I should sue because it’s not right. And they said that the company personally interviewed me, so they know my credentials.  Upon looking at the contract, the company can terminate me anytime even before the expiration of my contract as long as it’s within reason. Do you think that my termination is reasonable? For more information abt me, I live like 2 hours away from the company and there are days this week that I rode on a grab because I’m running late. I just want to know if it’s worth information technology to sue my former boss because of the said reasons? Or should I just let information technology go?","Should I sue my former boss?

Like they no longer view you as their child, sister, brother, etc but a Bank Account. I come from a well off but not rich family wherein me and my siblings were able to study on good schools, get the gadgets and items we NEED but don’t get a lot of our wants. But ever since we were young we were taught that we should study hard for our own careers so that we would not be dependent on our parents once we graduate and the money my parents saved from not giving us everything we want will be added to their retirement fund. Example of this is I only got 1 pair of shoes throughout college, bare minimum daily allowances to survive, etc. For context I’m the youngest of my siblings and something changed from my parents when they found out I got a good job right before graduation.  To add context also with this is that my parents told me that they will no longer help me fi cially with anything once I graduate and should figure out life on my own, in which my other siblings were helped by my parents even at least a year before being independent. I come from a top 3 Universities in Philippines and luckily got a good company that gives me php 100k as my starting salary, I’m in tech By The Way and Im lucky enough to get something this high.  Anyways I told my parents about the job I was offered and something changed with them rather than allowing me to live life on my own as we talked about for years, they wanted me to give them money to support them through retirement. I have no problems with helping them but They should know that I may be well off by salary but currently my bank account is literally php 0 since I haven’t even started and I have to pay for everything ( condo to stay in metro manila, furnishings, etc.). I don’t know if its the allure of money or its a reverse psychology thing with my parents telling us not to support them in our first few years but I truly feel like they view me more as an ROI at this point and I want to support them but I don’t want to enable the mindset that I’m gonna be their new source of passive income stream.

Dapat nag secretary ka hindi tl. kasi mukang admin work naman ang expertise mo  hindi ka marunong mag coaching. inoobserbahan kita pano ka mag coaching. binabasa mo lang din yung remarks sa email. edi sana ako na lang nag basa. ni-wala ka man lang mai-share na best practices mo wala kang leadership. napansin ko din na naiinis ka pag may error. gets ko naman na nakakainis talaga yon. pero sana wag mo na iparinig kung sino man kino-coaching mo na naiinis ka. ganyan ba ugali ng team leader nakakatamad ka katrabaho. nakaka demotivate. wala kang considerasyon. muntik na kaming masunugan. pinipilit mo pa din akong pumasok. kasi sabi mo may option tayong mag on site. so kelangan bang masunog muna yung bahay namin para lang magets mo? sinasabi ko naman sayo na isang eskenita na lang ang pagitan ng sunog sa bahay namin. dati ka bang tanga *( di ko alam pano to sasabihin in a professional way na hindi masyadong detailed kasi malalaman na agad kung sino) magaling pag ikaw may kelangan. pero pag meeting ang hirap manghingi sayo. sabi mo pag goods ang number laging may meeting. nasa 3rd spot na tayo. gusto mo number 1? hindi pwedeng puro ikaw nag bebenefit. sa sobrang gigil mo magka incentive nawawala na pagiging tao mo. hindi ipapamana sayo yang kumpanya. pinapa alala ko lang sayo. ,2,5,0.67,Advice Needed 🤔,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/142nzj5/how_to_this_in_a_professional_way/,142nzj5

Please refrain from insensitive comments na lang po thank you. A quick background: I'm a fresh graduate with a degree in Engineering (Cum Laude) from a reputable university. I failed my first take of board exams pero I passed information technology naman on the 2nd take, so basically one year na akong tambay and almost 3 months na rin po akong naghahanap ng work. Wala rin po akong prior work/OJT experience kasi po peak ng pandemic yung time na nagtake kami ng course for internships. Also, I'm planning to go abroad din po within 2-3 years so most likely, hindi rin ako magsstay long term sa company dito. I need your opinion po sa pagpili ng trabaho. Nakakainggit lang po kasi yung mga classmates ko with my same capacity na nakakakuha ng hindi toxic na workplace + decent pay. I think may right time din kasi yung job hunting para makakuha talga ng mga big fish and unfortunately, na-miss ko sila since nagreview pa ulit ako for my 2nd take of boards. Currently, for hiring na po ako sa company 1 pero medyo hesitant pa po ako because of many factors. Do you think this is the reality or am I being lowballed lalo na sa economy ngayon? Pros: Very good exposure, Good company, career-wise magagamit ko talaga yung experience sa abroad in the future. Ito sana yung career path na gusto ko. Sureball na may work ako Cons:   Compensation - 18k basic pay + 2k non-taxable allowance + gov't mandated benefits lang po yung makukuha ko. And ang sakit lang po isipin na anlaki-laki ng tuition ko + review center tapos ganun lang offer .   Work hours - (regular sched: mon-sat, 7 am - 4 pm) I think ang excessive po ng gantong schedule considering mahigpit pa sila sa time-in and time-out.   Work location - Nasa Mckinley West po kasi yung magiging project location ko so sobrang layo po and walang direct route para po makapunta doon unless magdala ng car. If maghahanap pa po ng titirahan, parang breakeven na lang po yung magiging salary ko since wala rin naman pong allowance for that since within Metro Manila pa rin naman po yung location.   Company 2: May 5 steps yung hiring process. Stage 1-2 is resume screening and exam. Currently nasa stage 3 na ako and interviews na lang talaga natitira for stages 3-5. Gusto ko sana i-risk yung opportunity dito and i-decline na yung offer ko sa company 1 kasi buong June yung stages 4-5. But the catch is medyo malilihis yung career path ko since sales dept. na siya, although sales engr. naman yung title. Pros:   Multi-national company   Good pay (minimum 39k), may personal driver for site visits.   Although palihis sa career na gusto ko, good opportunity pa rin siya for me since gusto ko magbusiness in the future and magtake ng MBA.   Same city lang din siya ng residency ko so malapit lang.   Work sched (Mon - Fri). Hybrid setup (optimal for me).   Mass hiring sila and catered talaga yung opportunity for a fresh grad like me.   Cons: 1. Madaming applicants so there's the UNCERTAINTY kung matatanggap ba ako.  Medyo off-track na sa specialization na initially planned ko i-pursue sana.  Ano po kayang mas magandang option between the two companies? Mas lenient naman ang mga first world countries sa mga fresh grad na degree holders, unlike dito sa Pilipinas, so I think I can start fresh ulit if gustuhin ko mang i-pursue talaga yung path na yon + may konting ipon na since good pay naman si company. As walang work experience kahit anong position po talaga ibigay sakin, willing ako tumanggap kasi wala pa rin po talaga akong idea sa gagawin ko sa office/site so I'm open po talaga sa career shifting.","Struggling Engineer Posted this on ready2adult Philippines but hindi pa rin na-aapprove so I'm taking my chances here.

I know it's partly my fault for not voluntarily paying the rent but now they are billing and charging me almost double for the unpaid rent for the past 3 years. Is that even legal?

While this is a business and freelance ako. I get his point and sobrang professional naman talaga out of all the people I worked with. Pati manner ng criticisms nya na nappreciate ko naman talaga. Pero na feel ko that this person does not care what happens to my life as long as I provide results. Why ko nasabi? Kasi I got issues ngayon sa laptop ko. Basically, he told me na, “as a professional you have to own up to your problems and for example the problem with your laptop is not my problem. I know you’re letting me know about..” ganun sabi nya. I thought tutulungan nya ko sa laptop ko Laughing out loud may talk pala about sa performance ko na caught off guard ako.  He also instructed me kung ano yung problems sa performance ko which could be done better. Naapreciate ko din ang feedback. I felt like although again professional tone pa din sya and with respect (medyo parang awkward nga na sabihin nya sakin yung issues) I feel like any time disposable/numbers lang ako hehe. I know business pinasok ko, nagtthrive lang din talaga ako sa mas may care sa akin. Parang pampalakas loob ba. May isang client pa kasi ako e, sobrang specific sya pero laging may pep talk. Napag compare ko lang. May ibang factors din na (mom na ko e) naririnig nya umiiyak anak ko but he doesn’t let me go sa call unless I ask pa. Ngayon, sabi nya work close daw kami ngayon meaning we have to talk end of day para i report kung anong ginawa ko for the day. For context lang: di kasi sya specific mag utos ng task and busy nga lagi so parang lost ako. Full time client saktong bayad naman. 1 full month pa lang ako pero parang medyo mahina na loob ko.

2022-06-20 22:46:31,Text-only,How to confront underperforming staff,"Supervisor here. New hire from another company. How do you guys confront/address yung underperforming na staff? We had a rush project last week ng May that should be done within a week. Pretty easy lang naman yung gagawin and at that time, called up yung staff and gave explicit instructions. Asked him if everything was clear, said ok. Tapos sabi ko rin if he has questions feel free to mesaage me. At this point experienced na sya, not a new hire. Asked him if he would prefer regular check-ins, sabi niya he will reach out na lang if need. Edi ako, ok. Set up review time for me to review his work. When I reviewed, grabe sobrang daming hindi natapos. We discussed what more needed to be done, what documents we need from client pa, etc. Luckily, client moved the timeline to June. So ayun nga, I set another review last week. Jusko halos same pa rin na halos walang natapos. Then I asked him to upload some documents so we can ready for Manager's review. Pagtingin ko kanina wala pa rin. Kanina I asked him what the problem was. Does he have other projects? Sabi naman wala. Do his supervisors and managers from past projects bother him to do more work? Sabi naman no. So I am now confused, WHYYYYY?????? He told me he was confused what to do. E bat hindi siya nag-reach out? Pag nagtatanong naman ako if may questions siya di naman nagsasabi. What did he do sa 40hrs/week???? Naiinis pa ako dahil offline sa Teams on working hours! I have to reach out sa Viber pa. On my part, I really don't bother if online/offline basta natatapos yung work. Pero nope. Wala naman halos nagagawa. So what is the problem??? We talked earlier kaso I'm not sure if effective ba. I haven't been in a situation like this before, kasi nung ako naman yung staff I've never been in his situation that's why I was never on either side of the conversation.

Manager said the recruiter will get in touch nalang with me for the next steps. 1 week later, no update from recruiter. Nag-follow-up ako, then she said na management is still discussing kasi they're still in the middle of deliberation and discussions etc. I had to press for more details, but she was vague about it. She could have said na possibly mag-freeze hiring muna sila but wala syang sinabing ganon. Sabi lang nya na hindi pa naman talaga sure na maha-hire ako.

She could have said na possibly mag-freeze hiring muna sila but wala syang sinabing ganon. Sabi lang nya na hindi pa naman talaga sure na maha-hire ako. She asked for another week before she can give me daw the final decision but that was it. I never heard from her again. I really want to reply in the most professional way. Pero gusto ko din iparating na she could have handled information technology better and shouldn't have ghosted me back then. Tips please on how to keep information technology professional while getting that point across. Thank you! in summary I really wanted to join their company last year. Recruiter ghosted me. Now she's recruiting me again. How to respond professionally while telling her she shouldn't have ghosted me before?",7,15,0.77,Advice Needed 🤔,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/159uxdr/how_to_respond_to_a_recruiter_who_ghosted_me/,159uxdr

I am working in a relatively big Business process outsourcing company, servicing other Asian countries with my teammates. The current practice in our account is to work during Philippines holidays since our service countries do not have holidays on those days.  Marami ang workload namin pero pag napaghati-hatian na mas keri na. Lottery lang din workload namin per day minsan sa isang araw sandamakmak minsan onti lang. Pero kahit dun, nakakapag work-life balance parin naman kami as in no joke. We also report to work during the holidays of our service countries, since Philippines is not on holiday on those days. During these days, our workload is just minimal to none.  Problem is our new manager wanted to propose a skeletal working system during Philippines holidays. This means that our manager wanted some of us not to work on Philippines holidays, retaining at least one team member per service country as a point person of the day. Of course, this depends on the volume of work daw.  The reasons are to increase savings within the company (since overtime pay will be reduced) and promote work-life balance etc. My teammates' and my concerns are:  No double pay - hindi naman sa mukhang pera kami pero any additional income is welcomed. Meron isa samin na kakapanganak palang ng asawa nya.   We're not complaining that we need to work on Philippines holidays. We could manage as long as kumpleto ang members per team. Mas gusto pa nga namin magtrabaho kasi wala naman kami gagawin kung hindi kami magtatrabaho. At least dagdag pay pa.   Hindi ba magtataka ang service country counterparts namin bakit hindi gumagalaw ang requests nila? I think hindi ito balak sabihin ng manager namin sa head ng service country na kausap namin e. Dagdag tambak din ito sa amin since naka assign kada tao ang work.   Pwde ba gamitin ang vacation leave pag pinagleave kami? Based sa labor code, entitled parin naman ang employee to 100% holiday pay kahit hindi sya nagtrabaho sa holiday.   Additional siguro for consideration: bago lang tong manager namin and before sya napunta samin, manager sya pero walang team. While discussing ito samin, di nya pinapakinggan yung concerns namin and cinucut off pa nya kami. Feeling nya kasi wala kami gano ginagawa. Di man lang nya sinubukan alamin yung process namin from start to finish to see if kaya ba itong skeletal sa amin. So ditong portion palang, we feel na unfair na. Also may kateam kami na mas matagal na sa manager namin sa company, tas never daw once ginawa ung skeletal system sa company during Philippines holidays.

Not in his company, not for anyone. If I'm going to lead, it's for MY OWN entrepreneurial endeavors. But as an employee (designer) - I'm the type who excels at executing design tasks, rather than taking charge and leading a team. Magaling akong gumawa, hindi gumabay.

On top of the work being toxic and our department in particular being understaffed, I can already feel that our job as records personnel is severely under-appreciated.

Apart from that, we facilitate the process of medical examinations from start to finish so we basically keep things running like clockwork. Our services are pretty much client-based, and people who took their medical there can leave their reviews. Today, we received one bad review directed at our department in particular. The complaint wasn't even about their own experience but of another person they were with when they took the medical, and it's the usual kind we get because the wait can honestly be long if they passed certain documents that we send for approval to our higher-ups. So imagine our distress when we suddenly hear they'd be issuing us a corrective action request. Something like that can not only affect our salary but our reputation as a department and as individual employees as well. The worst thing about information technology is the overall head of our clinic didn't even defend us. He did ask not to proceed with the CAR for now, but then he had to say that if another complaint about our department arises that's when they can issue one. Like, what the f*ck. And we can't even defend ourselves, because we can only do so if a CAR has already been issued against us, so we'd already have an offense by then.

I used to work in one of the top information technology companies in the country. My career growth was really good, got promoted twice in a span of 3 years. Work-life balance is not that good tho. Need to work on weekends, may times na 25 human resources yung overtime pag weekend. Kulang sa budget yung project sa tao kaya pag super busy nakakahiya mag sick leave kahit nung nagka covid ako (pure work from home naman ito). Tapos compensation is not that high pa dahil homegrown sa company. Talo ka talaga ng mga galing sa ibang companies. 6 months ago I transferred to a new company. small information technology company, less than 50 employees lang. I took information technology because salary growth was my priority at the time and 60% increase ang offer sa’kin. Kaso sobrang unhappy ako kasi nakakamatay yung oras ng pasok, 1AM to 10AM ng tues to sat. Tapos walang career growth. Hindi ako nailagay sa project na magagamit yung skillset ko tapos di man lang ako nilagay sa business hours kaya sobrang tahimik at walang magawa. Pero mayaman ako, pero di worth information technology In My Opinion lalo na’t nasanay ako sa mabigat yung workload at fast-paced na work environment at gusto ko talagang madaming matutu .

May offer na ako from one of the top information technology companies din, and i accepted information technology na. The thing is super layo ng office and medyo may trauma pa ako ulit sa project-based companies dahil sa current work ko nga. Who knows if mapunta ako sa project na kasing stag t din ng project ko ngayon tapos yung oras ng pasok baka nakakamatay din. My travel time would be around 3 human resources one way pa lang. But the offer is really good and desperate na akong umalis talaga. May ongoing application pa ako with a big local company naman, in-house na yung work at fixed dayshift yung schedule. The thing is super haba ng application process. I’m done with 3/4 interviews and each stage sinasabi ng interviewers that they really like me. Kaso ang dami kong nabasang bad reviews about this company from this subreddit.

I'm a 1st yr bs psychology student, and I'm currently studying in one of the colleges in manila. I'm currently working in the Business process outsourcing industry pala, and it's my 2nd company na rin then I just started last week. As of the moment, we have a month and a half to fulfill my training and my schedule is day shift (2pm to 10 pm) then night shift afterwards (after training). Then in my studies naman, I only have 3 subjects left then good to go for 2nd yr after. For more info, our curiculum is ... ang kada semester ay devided into 3 clusters. Unlike from other universities wherein information technology should be devided in midterm then final term. Hindi ganon 'yung amin. Then per clusters, we're taking 3 subjects. Just a heads up as well that per cluster is can be finish for only 6 weeks. (we just started this week for 2nd sem - 3rd cluster). My situation is, I have classes during mondays and tuesdays; 9 to 11 am, 1 to 3 pm, then 3 to 5 pm. I'll be able to attend in my first class, as well as my 2nd class since I can excuse myself naman at makaka attend ako ng class at least an hour. Anyways, we're in an online class setup pala this cluster. However, when I reached out to my prof from my 3rd class (3 to 5 pm) she's kinda inconsiderate even thought ang motto ng school is ""Working-Student Friendly."" Kaya nga ako nag-aral ulit eh, dahil sa motto nila na 'yan. Nakapag stop kasi ako ng 1 yr due to pandemic at fi cial difficulties. information technology was during the class pala and the class is about to end at that time, then information technology was my first break naman sa work. She instructed me to reach out na lang to her after the class through email because there's a group activity as well that I missed, and she want to do the activity ng individual. information technology doesn't rlly matter for me if groupings or individual thingy. I know what I can do naman. So, I write a formal letter na lang to her instead so that I can explain myself as well. So, my problem is, since training pa lang ako sa work, bawal umabsent, isang absent is equivalent to disqualification. So, I might lost my job which is I don't to happen because even if I'm still with my parents, I'm the one who's paying my tuition. My job is my source of income. Kaya, I really can't lost my job, kasi if ever, wala naman akong pambayad ng tuition. I have issues with my family din, but I don't want to add pa 'yon. Sobrang gulo lang talaga ng situation ko. Ako lahat umaako ng expenses ko and 'yun nga, my job is my source of income.  Balak ko kasi mag transfer sa PUP on my 2nd year, and I have to pay my 2nd sem tuition As Soon As Possible para smooth na lang 'yung transition ko from my current school to PUP. Para less gastos na rin for me. My problem is, if ipagsasabay ko 'tong current work and study ko, I might fail this one subject (3rd class). In addition, magkakaroon pako ng problema for processing my application sa PUP. On the other side, I can still quit my current job, so that I can focus on my studies then once tapos na 'tong cluster (which is itong 2nd sem) then go back sa pag-apply sa ibang company na naman. Ang kaso naman, 'di pa fully-paid 'yung tuition ko, almost 1/2 pa ata ng 2nd sem. If I'll keep my job, mababayaran ko sya and makakapag transfer ako. Ang kaso naman, baka magka-failed subj ako since conflict nga 'yung schedule ko, edi mas lalo ako mahihirapang mag transfer. I've been trying to sleep since I got home (it's 5:04 am now), pero hindi ako makatulog. Hindi ako makapag-isip ng maayos.  Disclaimer: My previous clusters are all morning classes kaya I was able to attend every class. Competitive pa nga ako eh. Points na nga lang eh, deans list na.

After 2 months, nilipat ako sa ibang department as an appointment setter, something that I am not familiar and wala pang experience. But of course, tinuruan ako ng mga tenured agents and in fairness naka cope up din naman ako kaagad and was able to get commissions and incentives on top of my salary. So yun na ang naging work ko sa company until i resigned. Maganda ang management ng operations nun though di talaga maiiwasan na merong power trippers, micro managers, sucker of praise, etc. Our Ops Manager resigned and she was replaced by a Fil-Am guy. He implemented a lot of changes especially on our incentive scheme at marami pa. Drastic changes talaga. Pero nung time na yun, hindi ko nalang iniisip since I still have our supervisor na kahit alam mong hirap na hirap na sa mga tasks because of the new management, she never missed to motivate us and she made sure na tama ang salary and commissions or incentives namin. Pandemic April 2020, i was one of the lucky agents na hindi dinismiss ang contract. Sobrang takot lahat nun since di mo talaga alam kung hanggang kelan ka nalang sa company. At first, we were lucky enough to bring our equipments sa kanya kanya naming bahay, nag provide din ang company ng internet, groceries (kasama na yung mga na lay-off) at mga gamot. After 2 weeks, we received an return to office memo from our Ops Manager at pinag stay kami lahat sa isang apartment and the company provide transpo para sa pag hatid-sundo. I  think eto yung highlight ng pag stay ko sa company na yun. Thankful ako kasi di ko naranasan ang mawalan ng trabaho throughout the pandemic at nakakabili parin ako ng gusto ko. Post pandemic: October 2022, my supervisor resigned and made a permanent move back to their province in Iloilo and as her fellow ilonggo, sobrang nalungkot ako nung time na yun. Since we no longer have a supervisor, my teammates and I were split up among various teams. The remaining supervisor did a draw lots system para fair ""daw"" yung distribution. So, napunta ako sa supervisor which happens to be one of the top revenue contributor sa company. At first, okay naman yung pamamalakad nya sa team and I got the support that I need during the transition. After few months, we noticed that she's already micro-managing us, lahat ng kilos namin kalkulado and worst is none of us can take a break unless we provide appointments.  Sa thought pa lang na ""you can't take your breaks, unless you provide me an appointment"" madede-motivate ka na talaga, plus the micro manage at pressure. Just imagine na kailangan mo pang tumakas para lang maka yosi tas kelangan pag nag yoyosi focus ka dapat kung pano mo mauubos ang isang stick sa tatlong puff lang lol. Same goes with kung pano ka kakain (though we are allowed to bring food sa station namin pero sisitahin ka naman pag tumayo ka Laughing out loud After couple of days, I passed my resignation via email. Actually immediate resignation yon. Ayoko naman talaga mag immediate resignation eh, di ko lang talaga kaya makipag plastikan sa supervisor namin if nag render pako.

Pri-nocess ko na rin kaagad yung exit interview ko with that company and I was able to sign all necessary docs para makuha ko ang last pay ko Laughing out loud sayang din yun. Actually, I have no regrets na umalis ako sa kumpanya na yun though at the back of my mind ""sayang"" kase okay ang sweldo tsaka malaki ang commissions and incentives. Pero nung time na yun, naging firm ako ang priority ko, and that is my mental health.

2023-08-05 23:38:40,Text-only,Lack of trainings here in the Philippines. Little Rant,"I don't know if this happens as often at other more advanced countries as often as information technology happens here in the Philippines. But companies here managed by Older Filipino managers, majority of the time does not impose trainings and they expect you to perform just as good as the other employees who had been working there for years. Just a short story for further context. Had my first job, complete noob and my manager expect me to perform well. I didn't. Even though I have good credentials after graduating college, cum laude, information technology would not be enough to surmount that huge knowledge gap from the company. But he kept bringing my credentials up to me whenever he thinks I am underperforming. information technology would have been great if there was a manual or guidelines explaining how and why these processes are done or why are they there in the first place. information technology would have been much easier than asking someone else for help (I found out later in my experience that companies must have these manuals, guidelines and other things explaining their processes so that when no person/co-worker is capable of assisting you, you can manage information technology by yourself) Been with the company for six months and made major achievements for the company such as reduction of reject and wasted materials up to 0.3% consistently during my probationary period and improve output to 110%, OEE to 92%. Not excellent numbers really but good enough. The impact is felt throughout the company but the manager takes all the credit. Yet, he considers me underperforming. Because he sees that that was his achievement, not mine, he never gave me the raises nor promotion that was necessary. He just basked in the limelight all the while squeezing me every bit of output from me. Quit, resigned and the company fell down a very deep hole. As information technology turned out, allocations of budget had been already set in stone since the owner is seeing that we are capable of maintaining those numbers during my time. However, after my resignation, those numbers can no longer be met and thus making the company lose more money than information technology ever should since they moved on to take projects they can not meet and constantly being penalized for not achieving the required numbers. Manager's ego is very big. He does not want the owner to know that what kept him above the water is because of his good employees. All those experienced and good employees resigned and he was left with new employees. Never invested on them nor gave them proper care. He just squeezed numbers from them. Numbers could have been met if the manager is not too repulsive and he actually invested in his key employees. Nah, bro, he invested only on his solutions that does not work. Mind you these project charters he had been providing has no data nor basis for it. He just believes information technology works. Well, information technology doesn't, sucks for him.  My third job, same thing and the fourth one is a different story. My fourth job is a very big company. Everything there is free including dorm rent and food. Exceptions only to hygienic products. The company as a whole is great. However, the department I was in is not. News of high attrition rate and abuse not being addressed is EXTREMELY PREVALENT in that department. human resources is not doing anything to resolve that issue in that department since procurement manager and human resources manager are helping each other out. There had been very talented and experienced employees that had been with the department and all of them wasted by this manager. I am not as skilled as anyone who left the company before me, however I have very specific skills that keeps me at an advantage to them. That's why they kept me in that company. Problem is, I am new to that department and don't know all the processes involved much more the idiosyncrasies of the workplace. No training done nor skim through of the processes. No manuals nor guidelines and certainly no assistance from tenured employees. Employees there are also toxic. Had to do information technology on my own. Luckily, I program stuff so workload that should take a tenured employee to do for hours only takes me minutes. But problem is, even though I can finish workload fast, there are things I can't do. Other departments really like me, since I was the only one who took the position who can manage the workload (I can do information technology since I have made work automatic). But the manager, I don't know what his problem is, always scolds me. Problems which are very vague. I ask him to clarify what is actually the problem. He gave reasons that does not make sense. From wrong formats (which does not really matter since the files I used are only for tracking things and automating stuffs. They never are submitted. He just sees what I do whenever he goes to my spot.) and not following the chronological order of doing stuff. That chronological order does not really matter as well. Well, customers call you at different times of the day. Owner sees the improvement in only two months from our department sepcifically from the task that I had been working on and added me to the Group in which the owner is also present. Manager's attitude and aggression towards me heightened even further and drove me to resignation. Funnily enough he keeps adding me to groupchats so that the owner sees that I am still in the company.  Currently in a new Company with training. Problem is, the president, who is japanese caught wind of the culture of his company since they do not implement trainings. This pissed off the president and mandated clearly that rules set on the manuals must be followed. However, the culture of the company remained. Coworkers kept telling me nasty stuff like I was so blessed jokingly. Back then they endured things without trainings nor assistance boastfully. Even to go as far as say that they are better than me if they had trainings.  Here's what I observed. Assistance from coworkers are great. In fact better than reading a book or manual. In my experience there are very few, sometimes they are not from my department, who assists me. However, manuals and guidelines are better in a few aspect. Since they do not get busy nor toxic. Sometimes you meet the person whom you need assistance from a specific task but would rather not divulge info because they do not like you or their ego is being stepped on. Next, Filipino managers (majority, not all) does not really know how to do their jobs well. But this is more prevalent with older managers than younger ones. If there are older managers who can do this well, I have never met one. I have only met younger managers who really do their jobs well.  The purpose of the post is to inform some and also to discuss what best practices are possible to improve employee performance especially new hires and this is also a rant. Currently I am working with no standards nor formats. So I usually report with my own format. Scolded a few times because they do not like how information technology looked or formatted. Asked them how to improve. They only gave vague answers like, this is too big this is too small etc. There should be numbers not descriptions, like how big, how small etc. Next, communication. This is the first time I have been in a company where influx of information is not well circulated. Monitorings of data which you need are not saved in a single drive where accessible nor being divulged. Not because there is a policy about divulging info but because some people just don't want to divulge information technology to you. I really don't knowwhat their gimmick is since I asked why they are not giving information technology easily. I got a reply of ""Dapat matuto kang kunin yung data sa production mismo"". Bro, information technology is not in my job description to monitor your shit, that' your job. Monitoring of that data also takes days not just in a single day. Although there are trackers to keep things documented. That is the only time the policy of divulging info is disallowed. Since information technology is not my job to communicate to that department about the monitorings, they literally tell me that there are only specific named personnel to which they can share those info. Any story you can share as well regarding this and how you addressed them?","Lack of trainings here in the Philippines.

Because he sees that that was his achievement, not mine, he never gave me the raises nor promotion that was necessary. He just basked in the limelight all the while squeezing me every bit of output from me. Quit, resigned and the company fell down a very deep hole. As information technology turned out, allocations of budget had been already set in stone since the owner is seeing that we are capable of maintaining those numbers during my time. However, after my resignation, those numbers can no longer be met and thus making the company lose more money than information technology ever should since they moved on to take projects they can not meet and constantly being penalized for not achieving the required numbers. Manager's ego is very big. He does not want the owner to know that what kept him above the water is because of his good employees. All those experienced and good employees resigned and he was left with new employees. Never invested on them nor gave them proper care. He just squeezed numbers from them. Numbers could have been met if the manager is not too repulsive and he actually invested in his key employees. Nah, bro, he invested only on his solutions that does not work. Mind you these project charters he had been providing has no data nor basis for it. He just believes information technology works. Well, information technology doesn't, sucks for him.  My third job, same thing and the fourth one is a different story. My fourth job is a very big company. Everything there is free including dorm rent and food. Exceptions only to hygienic products. The company as a whole is great. However, the department I was in is not. News of high attrition rate and abuse not being addressed is EXTREMELY PREVALENT in that department. human resources is not doing anything to resolve that issue in that department since procurement manager and human resources manager are helping each other out. There had been very talented and experienced employees that had been with the department and all of them wasted by this manager. I am not as skilled as anyone who left the company before me, however I have very specific skills that keeps me at an advantage to them. That's why they kept me in that company. Problem is, I am new to that department and don't know all the processes involved much more the idiosyncrasies of the workplace. No training done nor skim through of the processes. No manuals nor guidelines and certainly no assistance from tenured employees. Employees there are also toxic. Had to do information technology on my own. Luckily, I program stuff so workload that should take a tenured employee to do for hours only takes me minutes. But problem is, even though I can finish workload fast, there are things I can't do. Other departments really like me, since I was the only one who took the position who can manage the workload (I can do information technology since I have made work automatic). But the manager, I don't know what his problem is, always scolds me. Problems which are very vague. I ask him to clarify what is actually the problem. He gave reasons that does not make sense. From wrong formats (which does not really matter since the files I used are only for tracking things and automating stuffs. They never are submitted. He just sees what I do whenever he goes to my spot.) and not following the chronological order of doing stuff. That chronological order does not really matter as well. Well, customers call you at different times of the day. Owner sees the improvement in only two months from our department sepcifically from the task that I had been working on and added me to the Group in which the owner is also present. Manager's attitude and aggression towards me heightened even further and drove me to resignation. Funnily enough he keeps adding me to groupchats so that the owner sees that I am still in the company.  Currently in a new Company with training. Problem is, the president, who is japanese caught wind of the culture of his company since they do not implement trainings. This pissed off the president and mandated clearly that rules set on the manuals must be followed. However, the culture of the company remained. Coworkers kept telling me nasty stuff like I was so blessed jokingly. Back then they endured things without trainings nor assistance boastfully. Even to go as far as say that they are better than me if they had trainings.  Here's what I observed. Assistance from coworkers are great. In fact better than reading a book or manual. In my experience there are very few, sometimes they are not from my department, who assists me. However, manuals and guidelines are better in a few aspect. Since they do not get busy nor toxic. Sometimes you meet the person whom you need assistance from a specific task but would rather not divulge info because they do not like you or their ego is being stepped on. Next, Filipino managers (majority, not all) does not really know how to do their jobs well. But this is more prevalent with older managers than younger ones. If there are older managers who can do this well, I have never met one. I have only met younger managers who really do their jobs well.  The purpose of the post is to inform some and also to discuss what best practices are possible to improve employee performance especially new hires and this is also a rant. Currently I am working with no standards nor formats. So I usually report with my own format. Scolded a few times because they do not like how information technology looked or formatted. Asked them how to improve. They only gave vague answers like, this is too big this is too small etc. There should be numbers not descriptions, like how big, how small etc. Next, communication. This is the first time I have been in a company where influx of information is not well circulated. Monitorings of data which you need are not saved in a single drive where accessible nor being divulged. Not because there is a policy about divulging info but because some people just don't want to divulge information technology to you. I really don't knowwhat their gimmick is since I asked why they are not giving information technology easily. I got a reply of ""Dapat matuto kang kunin yung data sa production mismo"". Bro, information technology is not in my job description to monitor your shit, that' your job. Monitoring of that data also takes days not just in a single day. Although there are trackers to keep things documented. That is the only time the policy of divulging info is disallowed. Since information technology is not my job to communicate to that department about the monitorings, they literally tell me that there are only specific named personnel to which they can share those info. Any story you can share as well regarding this and how you addressed them?",5,2,0.78,Rant 😡,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/15iytt9/lack_of_trainings_here_in_the_philippines_little/,15iytt9

How do I respond to this correctly? Initially, I plan to negotiate pa din for salary adjustment and if di talaga nila ibibigay, I would rather reject the promotion and stay with my current role. Nabasa ko na yung common advices in the thread similar sa ganitong situation which is to accept the promotion, add the role to your resume and apply sa iba. Pero ang dilemma ko kasi eh unusual naman tong trabaho ko and nag check din ako wala naman ako mahanap na pwedeng malipatan na similar role, and sobrang importante din sakin kasi na full remote setup.  Also, in my mind, if I reject the promotion, information technology might give a bad impression sa company, and bilang isang contractor baka maka apekto yun na di na i-renew yung contract ko.  Ayun lang, thank you at hingi lang sana ng mga insights niyo. Hirap talaga maging alipin ng kapitalismo!","Promotion Without Salary Adjustment (What's the best response?) For context, I am an engineer working since 2012. Currently, I am working in this international company pero Independent Contractor role, meaning, walang benefits, Health Maintenance Organization etc. Lumipat ako dito dahil sa full remote setup. Disclaimer lang di ako dollar rate kundi PHP rate pa din. Several months ago I applied for the position, I would say entry level yung role kaya nga entry level salary din yung inoffer sakin pero nakipag negotiate ako stating how my experiences are relevant to the role, then binigay naman expected salary ko.

I am not complaining naman as I understand my parents’ intentions to teach me about money.

I took out several small personal loans to pay for information technology as I cannot apply for a larger amount that banks offer as I am not employed yet. Yun lang, some of these lending institutions charged high interests. I have paid around 25% of these but I am still around 35k in the hole.  This made me think that I might need to apply for a job (part time or full time) to pay for these loans and to save money din.

Yun lang, some of these lending institutions charged high interests. I have paid around 25% of these but I am still around 35k in the hole.  This made me think that I might need to apply for a job (part time or full time) to pay for these loans and to save money din. My educational background naman is nice and I come from one of the most prestigious unis here in the PH. Any advice on how to get hired and what to do once I get job offers? I would also like to hear thoughts on how people with a similar situation in the past as me have dealt with this?

I then proceeded to find new work and managed to find one which is a well known branded company. However, I needed to go home to process the new work permits, etc and they said information technology takes 4-5 months. So I went back home in April but have anxiety that my offer will get rescinded with how easy layoffs can happen (I work in IT). Now a recruiter in May for a well known company here in Philippines reached out and long story short I got into the company but the thing is they only confirmed my employment this July and Im starting in August. To note my work permit is still in processing since May and there is no visible time table on when information technology will finish only that I know information technology may finish by september  So do you think its okay joining this company knowing ill be leaving once the permit is finished?","Joining a new company knowing I’ll be going abroad in 2 months For context:  I was laid off from my previous work abroad in January in an EU country.

Walang anything na nakasulat  na pwedeng palitan or baguhin yung details na nasa formal job offer letter. 4 days before the supposed start date, nag email si company and ipupush back daw nila yung start date ng one month. Ang reason nila hindi pa daw sila tapos sa new employee background investigation. Well lahat naman tayo somehow nagkakamali at  may mga bagay talaga na di natin maka-calculate pero bakit pinapirma agad ng formal job offer letter? At ano pang purpose ng formal job offer letter kung di rin naman pala susundin yung agreement dun? Yung iba sa batch namin galing pa sa malayong lugar at nag secure na ng apartment malapit sa company office since supposedly mag start na yung work. Nag turn down ng other job offer opportunity from other companies. And nag spend ng effort, time, and money na hiniram lang nila para makapag start ng maayos para ipush back lang ng ganun. Kahit apology hindi man lang ginawa. Though alam ko naman ng makakahanap pa ako/kami ng better opportunities. Ang sakin lang napaka UNPROFESSIONAL, OPPRESSIVE at sobrang POWER TRIP ng ginawa  dahil sa conpany sila pwede nila gawin yung ganun? Is this even legal? Is there any action we can do about information technology Would appreciate kind and respectful help, comments and advice.","Employer failed to comply with the start work date as per the agreed and signed from the formal job offer letter.

2023-06-19 03:17:57,Text-only,Do employers really consider micro-credentials in job openings?,"Hey there! I don’t really know where to post this. But I am an upcoming fresh graduate for Computer Engineering, as a program/course that didn’t have a board exam (or a certification exam). The correlation subjects that we had during our time at school was primarily subscribing to online courses which to specific topics aligned to our program, including those from Coursera and LinkedIn (even CompTIA). Our head professor usually encourages us to take these courses especially CompTIA however most of us cannot take information technology due to budget constraints. She even insisted that information technology is for us anyways, and information technology is useful for our future. As someone who is aspiring to be employed in the next few months, I wanna ask for validation for what our professor had told us. I just have this feeling na may referral fee siya sa mga ito (i hope I’m wrong ). I wanna know especially from information technology companies if they take these certificates into consideration. Thank you!","Do employers really consider micro-credentials in job openings? Hey there! I don’t really know where to post this.
