Job application

After weeks of consideration we have decided to go with another candidate who is better suited to our needs at this time.

It was noted during your interviews, you told both our recruiter and the hiring manager that ""they wasted your time because they were late"" and ""you took time off from work just to hear a low ball offer and that we should have posted the salary range in the job description"" We told you that we do this so people won't apply just for the money. After which you replied ""what money?""

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Yung saktong incompetence lang. For example, nagkukunwari ako na nahihiya ako mag present sa mga VIP clients ng important pitch. This way, e dadahan dahan lang ako ni management tsaka bibigyan lang ako ng mga training on ""how to present"". Tapos at some point, makikita nila ang galing ko na mag present and sobrang confident ko. Proud din yung management sa ""growth"" ko and natuwa din sila sarili nila na gumana training nila. Pero sa totoo lang, never naman ako nahihiya or naiilang. Kayang kaya ko naman. Tamad lang, lalo na hindi ko naman main job yun. In the end, dahil sa galing ng ""growth"" and ""initiative to learn"" ko, na gustuhan nila ako. Na promote pa ako. Also, nagkunwari ako na hindi ako ganun ka galing sa excel. Sabi ko I need time to study excel bago e improve yung current file nila. So mga ilang days, onti onti lang gingawa ko. Pa relax relax lang. Tapos naguupdate lang ako sa ""progress"" sa boss ko kahit alam ko naman talaga paano tapusin ng mabilisan. Sa huli, pinakita ko yung improved excel file and impressed ulit sila sa growth ko. Mukha akong self- starter and passionate employee lol. Is this ethical? Eh. Who cares. Even with the promotions, 1k to 2k lang naman na increase. I still contributed to the company's success. I could have done information technology faster, yes but do I care? No lmao. I'm gonna do things in my own, relaxing pace and management can feel proud of themselves for ""investing"" in me. If they want to really appreciate me, e pakita nila sa payslip ko. Hindi lang puro compliments. Compant profits are still not being trickled down anyway, no matter how well you perform. Don't work too hard. We can't escape the exploitative system but we can still play their stupid games.","Unethical Pro Tip: Pretend to be slightly bad at your job to get less workload and to stroke egos Siyempre, wag naman mag acting na sobrang incompetent ka na wala ka  g output or productivity.

2023-07-09 11:50:11,Image,Justice4JollibeeWorkers,"#JUSTICE4JOLLIBEEWORKERS CAMPAIGN LAUNCH || On July 6, former Jollibee workers at Jollibee Journal Square delivered a powerful letter to management after being illegally terminated earlier this year for organizing for higher wages. Instead of hearing the pleas' and demands of the workers, management cooperated with the New Jersey Police Department to make sure they weren't able to deliver their letter.
The former Jollibee workers were greeted by 50+ supporters to amplify their message and make sure that the management and the public knew of their demands.
Shame on Jollibee for illegally terminating workers in New Jersey who were exercising their right to organize! LIVING WAGES NOW! DEFEND WORKER RIGHTS!

Two months ago, I have been taken out of my sales job and have been promoted to Director of Hiring and Culture. Mind you, I work for a geopolitical consultancy firm that sells market research and sponsored content. One of the my marching orders as the head of culture and people training is to find talent.I don't have a background in human resources I don't even have a background in management, but, heck, I'll make information technology work. And ang sabi ko ""okay, I'll come up with a plan, but on one condition: give me free reign as to how I would find, train and retain talent"" and they said yes. Now, I'm a rebel by definition. I was a misfit in high school. I failed Ateneo, I failed UP, I passed DLSU (but was not able to enroll coz I had to take summer classes). I even failed UST. The only reason I was able to study in UST for one year was that my dad was close to our village Parish Priest. And the Parish Priest said ""we lack seminarians. You wanna give UST a go? yun nga lang seminarista ka"" and I said ""fuck information technology let's go."" My parents sent me to new york to complete my undergrad studies, eventually, but information technology was a circuitous route. And you know, I'd hate for other people to undergo the same bullshit na pinagdaa  ko sa hiring and training and all that. I hate the feeling of people making you feel like you're outside looking in. So I decided, I'm not going to go through the traditional LinkedIn, JobStreet, Head Hunter avenues. I'm gonna find talent on Reddit. And I said, I'm not going to require our applicants na they should be a college graduate, at least 5'4, 21-25 yrs old with pleasing personality. Let's make this even a bit more exciting. I want to open the application process (and encourage) person with disabilities out of school youth, formerly incarcerated people, retirees, and other people who may not fit the traditional mold of a corporate organizational man. But wait, there's more.  I'm not going to require people to have an NBI clearance, Transcript of records, Certificate of employment, and other red tape nonsense. Plus, it's bullshit to require people to come to the office. Even tho have my office in Rockwell, I dont go there. Kung hindi ako pumupunta dun, bakit ko papupuntahin mga tao dun? Stretching that logic, why should I hire only from Manila? Why not from the far flung regions? It's work from home anyway. Across all data points and criteria, Potato Corner would have a stricter hiring policy than my policy, even though one requires that person to serve french fries, and this other job allows you to attend zoom meetings with chief executive officer who talk about about the implications of the Taiwan-China rift in supply chain. There was only a couple of  conditions, in my view. That person has to have good work ethic,  be able to speak forgivable English and be passionate about geopolitics. Like, that's it.  Full stop. I got 167 applications. Got 2 positions, one guy who lives in Baguio and a University of the Cordilleras Graduate who initially wanted to work for us for free in return for sales mentorship and how to do strategic planning, but I said, what if I can give you both and a salary? Laughing out loud And another guy who lives in Davao, UP Graduate impeccable English, software Dev but couldn't find a job due to some disability.  These two guys of super high caliber I otherwise would not have found if I followed the Philippine corporate human resources non-sense. Today was a good day, and I'm proud of myself. And I'm not content. I don't know this, I dont know a lot about human resources and people development. I'm just a Philosophy graduate. I wanna learn more. Last Friday, I closed a $39,000 deal, and my boss closed another $78,000 deal. That should give the firm a little bit more breathing space to grow and hire more talent in the short to medium term.. Once we bounce back from the pandemic, we're going to go back to hiring entry level roles that start at 60K / month net and 100k month /net after their 6 month probation. You can be rest assured, this misfit who didn't pass the Big  4 will find more and better talent than those traditional companies.","Today was a good day, I'm proud of myself as a hiring manager I've been a sales director for 8 years.

Kinabukasan bakit daw hindi ako pumunta ng tuesday, wala siya wed. So nalipat nh thurs Thurs nakausp ko production staff nila tinaanong kano rate nila, 350 a day daw, medyo masama na kutob ko. Tinuloy ko pa rin interview, gusto ng boss mabilis maganda at marami magagawa sa isang araw, bawal standard kelangan unique. Tinuloy ko yung design test , umalis yung boss. Ti ong ko sa graphic artist nila kung kano sahod niya. 500 a day daw. Sa isip ko pareho lang bg sahod ko so bakit pa ako lilipat. Mas marami trabaho mas mahal pamassahe. Umalis ako after a few hours nag pm yung boss via facebook. Bakit daw sabi ko pang janitor ang rate nilla sa graphic artist. Eh sabi ko yun ang sabi ng ga niyo, bakit naman siya mag lie ano makukuha niya sa pagsinungaling sakin nung nagtanong ako. Todo trigger si boss na mali daw ako dahil di daw sa kanya  galing. Tapos sabi mag janitor na daw lang ako. Napaka unprofessional diba. Nung sinabi ko yun sa madam, hindi naman niya dineny yung sahod, sabi sakin di daw ako mabibigyan ng malaki kasi hindi pa alam ang skills ko. So 3 people nag indicate na mababa talaga sahuran. Bakit pa ko mg stay hanggang 5pm kung alam ko na na ganun. May karapatan ako tumangi. Yung office pa nila sobrang luma parang anytime magugunaw na  Madali lang daw kasi graphic artist kasi hindi naman daw nagbubuhat.

While I agree that inflation will potentially just ""eat up"" your meager salary increase, he/she implies that being employed is miserable and will keep you and your family poor for the rest of your life. Worse, people are commenting ""Amen!"" ""Agree!"" ""Lodi"". Honestly, I am smh and irked at this toxic mentality.  What he/she failed to mention is that a lot of businesses fail, more often than not require capital, it's a 24/7 job etc. Not everybody is cut or has the talent to put up their own business from ground up. Being an employee is perfectly fine as long you do well at your work, you're happy, fulfilled and contented with your salary.  Kaya madaming nadedepress sa work nila because of these people. Yun lang. Thoughts?",241,142,0.98,Discussions üí≠,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/13y3l9g/why_do_some_influencers_look_down_on_being_an/,13y3l9g

Stop calling your company ""a family"".
Parents don't fire their children for poor performance, or lay them off to cut household costs when they're struggling to put food on the table.
Focus on being a team, built on trust and respect, where every person feels valued.

2023-06-14 11:15:16,Text-only,Supervisor wanted me to die rather to work from home. Chinismis pa ako sa friends niya sabi hayop ako.,"I worked in the company for almost a decade, I poured my heart and soul to the company and this is all I recieved. Just a little back story: I fell inlove with my former company. The best part about information technology was the first half of my tenureship. Everyone was friendly. Heck, even the top managers were friendly to the point that when I tend to finish the job, my managers kept insisting me to sleep on the couch for the rest of my shift (this were the early days of my work, they knew that that was my first time working night shifts). Company was pro-employee. Unli breaks, if majority of the people were late (due to heavy traffic, storm, etc), top management would waive the latency. They were pro-employee  to the point that when you watch 2 company basketballs games, you get a total of 8 hours offset.  Feeling happy and amused, I gave them their kindness with hardwork and dedication. I was awarded several times to  point that information technology was 'normal' for me and other good colleagues to walk on stage. information technology really felt llike a 2nd home. information technology was fun and all until the FIRE NATION ATTACKED! Good managers, Gone. Friendly people, Gone. Offset, unli breaks, Gone. Fast forward to my 2nd half of tenureship: Almost everyone I knew left the company because the rules and policies are not beneficial to them anymore. We had to adhere to the dedicated breaks, and when you failed to log in your biometrics from' lunch' to 'working' on time, there are sactions to be met (I don't mind this tho). They also installed a software wherein if you stop typing or just by moving your mouse, the system will alert the supervisor. Anyways, these are only minor stuff that changed. Biggest change were the management. Everyone left because of the 'new' management and the benefits. My last year in the company I recieved a whopping 500 peso increase. I was one of the top employees in the department. The insult is real Supervisors tends to gossip everyday. They even share other colleagues' sex life to us DURING MEETING. They tend to invalidate employees. When you are good looking, you are dead to them. To this day, I still do not understand their mind set. I am a person who typcially do not mind office drama and shit because I tend to focus my life outside the office but their are times that I had to literally raise my voice to at least stop their wrong doings. Fast forward to my last year in the company: This was the realization for me to get out of the hellhole.   Covid is still lingering and we have a new born infant. My infant was too small and fragile. I asked my superior if information technology was possible for me to work from home, to lessen covid possibilites (I had covid from the office months prior). She said NO. She said that my reason is INVALID. I let information technology go.   Months later, I was diagnosed with several lifestyle diseases (heart problem, highblood etc) due to weight gain and a decade of working during the night. I almost had a stroke from one of the shifts. Even the doctors advised for me to resign. I asked my supervisor if I may able to work from home (we only work on site once a week). She declined and said that information technology was not a valid reason, even though she knew that I was having a hard time working on site. We had a debate and eventually I had to submit. Motherficker sent a wrong message to me with a screenshot of our convo and stating that ""hayop""  ako. She even mocked me for having a disease. She saw her mistake and immediately took down the message. She knew that I have a strong personality, she knew that I tend to fight when aggravated. I reported her to HR. She called and said sorry several times but I just told her that is is sorry because she got caught. I can sue her arse but didn't continue. I just wanted to leave the company. I just filed my resignation and left.   I had the confidence to officially leave because when I realized the company is going downhill. Instead of ranting everyday, expecting things to change, I put my energy creating a business. I worked during the night, and also work during the day. I am thanking the lord everyday for the blessing. We now have 2 branches, my employees are happy and satisfied. Lesson I learned:    Do not be a marty. If the company is going downhill, leave. Find a new job. Don't waste your time expecting for a change.   Whatever your passion or goal in life. Pursue it. Being employed is another word for being expendable.

In my exit interview, I told human resources that one of the many reasons why I wanted to leave was the additional writing work that people kept trying to give to me that was beyond my scope of responsibilities.

Pag may mali kang ginawa, para kang nasa school na bubulyawan ka with matching recitation pa for you to realize na may mali kang ginawa. Bukod pa dun, ipapamukha pa sayo na hindi mo alam ang ginagawa mo kahit alam mo naman. It's just that mahirap talaga this days. Kahit naman sya alam nya na mahirap pero ipapamukha nya sayo na ikaw ang may pagkukulang at hindi mo ginagawa ang trabaho mo. Nung turn ko na, nabulyawan nya ko nga malupit sa harap ng mga kaofficemate ko with staff and officers telling us na makakakuha kami ng ""D"" sa rating namin for next year because we're incompetent. That time, I've been with the company for a couple of months pa lang and grabe yung trauma ko that time na  gyari yun. I answered all her questions while she's fuming with anger kasi hindi  gyari yung gusto nya. I gave her the numbers while my other colleagues were just silent and just keep saying ""ok po"". But not me. And i think this is one of the reason na after that incident, naramdaman ko ng pinag-iinitan nya na ko. On that same month, I raise this to human resources and told them I wanted to be transferred sa ibang unit and told her na hindi ko kaya yung ganung klase ng working environment.  I've also been a leader but I don't do that sa mga tao ko. Nakakahiya mang sabihin pero naiyak ako habang nagkukwento sa HR. Sabi nya sakin, maghahanap daw sya ng post na available.  After that incident and my report with human resources walang  gyari. Sabi wala daw available na post so I decided to look for a new employer and goods naman kasi I am being interviewed na and just recently I started working na for this company. Then during the exit interview, I told  human resources about my experience. I told her na i reported this mula nung mangyari yung incident na yun but no feedback was given to me telling me na walang opening and other units preferred yung may experience na sa mga role na pwede ko sana applyan. Sadly, yung naginterview sakin for exit interview, sinabi nya sakin na walang nag-raise sa kanya na nagrerequest ako for transfer kasi sya pala ang may hawak ng internal transfer. I'm actually surprised and disappointed kasi akala ko tinutulungan ako nung naghire sakin, pero in reality hindi pala.  Fast forward,  nalaman ng boss ko lahat ng sinabi ko kay human resources sa exit interview. Now, galit na galit sa akin yung former manager ko and was asking kung saan daw ako nagtatrabaho. They say not to burn bridges, but in this case I can't do that. Sya ang main cause bakit nagpapalpitate na ko everytime may naririnig akong sumisigaw. Bumaba din ang self-confidence ko after ng mga sinabi nya.  To be honest, I don't have regrets however, napapaisip ako na once alam na nya kung saan ako nagwowork baka siraan nya ko kahit hindi totoo.  I'm under probationary right now with my current work and nalaman ko lahat ng to dahil yung isang naging close friend ko sa loob, mineeting sila tungkol sa feedback ko sa kanya and ayun nga binabad-mouth ako ng former manager ko.","Former manager tracking me Sorry for the long post ahead .

In her lengthy post, Angelica Batungbakal shared the unfair working conditions that employees had to deal with while working at the coffee company from short staffed branches, constant reshuffling, multi tasking and even having no breaks. The complaint was picked up by Raffy Tulfo in Action where Batungbakal was joined by other employees who also had their fair share of complaints. Batungbakal said that she was slapped with a 30 day suspension after human resources asked her to return from Bulacan while she was on an authorized leave for her relative‚Äôs death anniversary. Instead of accepting the sanction, she made the decision to resign; however, her final payment is still being withheld. In her original Facebook post where she tagged Raffy Tulfo in Action, she said that 58 other employees had their salaries on hold for various reasons but they were too afraid to complain. Another employee, Steven Fajaril, said that he actually did not know why he did not receive his salary last June 30. When he asked about this, he said the assistant area manager told him he was rude and he was suspended as a result. However, he said the only reason he raised his voice was because he felt wronged. He said this was the second time this happened to him and he is currently suspended from work.

2023-08-10 16:36:57,Text-only,My employer rescinded my Job offer after telling me to resign from my previous job,"The title says information technology all. Context:   I applied, passed several rounds of interviews, got hired, and was told to render my two weeks‚Äô notice while waiting for my Job offer and contract to be sent. I did everything that was required, was diligent and updated human resources through every single step, and made sure to get the proper notice from them. (Mind you, this is a good and respected company that I have been wanting to work for since I encountered them in a small project through the development sector. )  So imagine my surprise when out  of nowhere, I was told via email that my offer got rescinded on the week that I was scheduled for onboarding with them.  Focus daw muna sa ibang areas for the year, on  hold daw muna  yung supposed position ko.  Eh bakit pa pala kayo nagpost ng vacancies?  Bakit kayo nag-engage ng applicants?  Bakit kayo nag proceed with application steps?  Sobrang unprofessional ng ginawa nila and super uncalled for, considering na isa sila sa mga ‚Äúelite‚Äù  (at well-funded) na orgs sa DevSec circle dito sa PH.  Legally alam ko wala sila liability,  due to the absence of a Job offer and contract.  But the fact that you made an applicant go through so much trouble for a post that you‚Äôre suddenly deciding to put ‚Äúon hold‚Äù AFTER instructing that person to resign is incredibly unprofessional.   I was instructed to wait for the Job offer and contract. Pinag-resign ako. And now they left me  with an apologetic email full of vague corporate jargons reeking of plausible deniability.  Dream job na sana, naging bato pa.  in summary ginago ako ng would-be employer ko at ngayon naghahanap ako ng trabaho, at tambak na ang mga babayaran Ayoko magkalat online but I really just want to get this off my chest. So let this be a lesson to those who are considering leaving their current work dahil na-excite sa promise na trabaho ng ‚Äúdream‚Äù company mo.  Be very careful and vigilant, and don‚Äôt let your emotions and expectations of a ~good~ company cloud your judgement. EDIT:  Thank you so much for the advice, feedback and messages of support, guys! I really appreciate it.  Sobrang gago lang talaga na ganito yung ginawa sa akin ng org na to. I‚Äôll consider this a lesson learned (the painful way hahahuhu) and a bullet dodged na rin siguro.

2023-02-08 10:01:59,Text-only,Work-life balance versus Work-life integration,"I think there are a lot of misconceptions regarding work-life balance, and a lot of people confuse work-life integration with work-life balance. And this results in quick burn-outs and work dread. Drinking with your boss after your shift is not work-life balance. Having coffee dates with your work friends on the weekends is not work-life balance. And sure as hell playing sports with your work team/department in your free time is not work-life balance. All of these are examples of work-life integration. You integrated your work (your workmates) into your life, it's not a complete disconnect. One of the main issues of this setup is that it's inevitable to talk about work and it'll mix with your personal life even if you're not working. You'll talk about work while drinking, having coffee or during water breaks because that's what you and your work friends have in common. Meanwhile, work-life balance is defined as the amount of time you spend doing your job versus the amount of time you spend with loved ones or pursuing personal interests and hobbies. A complete disconnect from the corporate world. It's about doing what you love/like without even a hint of work-related topics. information technology may be playing single-player games after working hours, doing your sports with cousins/relatives on the weekends, or as simple as watching Netflix alone all day. I know even with a good work-life balance setup, you can still experience burn-outs, especially with subpar compensation and benefits but I think it'll help a lot if we start differentiating these 2. We can build a more solid boundary for bosses and workmates that try to contact us during off-work hours or teammates who try to hang out after work just to discuss pending work issues.","Work-life balance versus Work-life integration I think there are a lot of misconceptions regarding work-life balance, and a lot of people confuse work-life integration with work-life balance.

2022-09-25 22:45:41,Text-only,Lessons from My First Job,"I am finally rendering the last week of my very first job. Hindi ako umabot ng 1 year and that alone speaks volume (tho 1 week nalang sana at mag o one year na ako sa company). I just feel like writing here to document my realizations of a young adult na early na burnout and to probably help some readers of this sub. And if I may add, sa AntiworkPh ko rin navalidate ang urge kong mag resign from very first job kaya maybe proper lang na i return the favor. Disclaimer: All of the lessons enumerated are personal insights. You may or may not agree with these and that's fine. I believe this sub is a safe place for varied opinions. Lesson #1:  Don't feel pressured to work just because your peers are doing so. If you are able,then please take the time to look for the right company. Na pressure kasi ako sa mga peers ko na nakahanap na agad ng work which led me to accepting a job offer even tho i havent properly researched or had a good background of the work culture. Mindset ko kasi that time basta lang may work okay na, atleast im doing what everyone's doing. My lack of preparation led me to a job that constantly gave me anxiety and burnout. ‚Äã Lesson #2: Dont accept a job that comes with ""URGENTLY HIRING"" advertisement. Tendency kasi is that may aalis sa current position na inaaplayan mo and usually very limited na ang time para ma turnover sayo ang responsibilities. And based sa experience, tatambakan ka talaga ng backlogs. If you wish to accept job posts like this, make sure to ask human resources if there will be an adequate amount of time para ma turnover sayo ang responsibilities mo. ‚Äã Lesson #3: During interview, always ask human resources how is the company when information technology comes to work life balance, work culture, turnover rates, and the likes. By doing this, you will be able to determine whether you are amenable with the company given this limited information. Key point is the turnover rates, if you can, ask for the turnover rate for the specific position you are applying. If mabilis, then that's definitely a red flag. Definitely ask the company regarding work life balance kasi dun mo ma memeasure if ang future mo  sa company will be working to live or living to work. Always choose the first. And even if human resources sugarcoats their answer, malalaman mong they're lying based on how they answer. ‚Äã Lesson #4: As much as possible, dont apply in companies na 6 days work week. Ito siguro dahilan kung bakit early akong na burnout. For fresh grads out there, consider yung college days natin. If too much na nga ang 5 schooling days then how much more ang 6 working days? Some people can probably survive, pero very lesson learned na para sa akin to ensure na may atleast 2 DAYS REST DAY ako. Eh nung student pa ako kulang na kulang na nga sa akin ang weekends to rest.  Having a one day day off constantly makes me dread going to work. ‚Äã Lesson #5: Observe how your seniors work.Pag nasa company ka na, observe the work culture of your seniors. Kasi doon din naman ang path na pupuntahan mo if you prefer to stay longer sa company. From experience kasi, few months into my work, napapansin kong always nag OOT ang mga seniors ko and nagtatrabaho parin kahit nasa bahay. Wala talagang work life balance mga seniors ko kaya i decided to resign kasi im starting to experience information technology also. Lesson #6: Never apply sa family business ng mga FIL-CHINESE companies. Bossing mo lahat ng family member at napakabarat when information technology comes to salary increase. Para sa kanila, bawal ang overbreak pero okay lang overworked. ‚Äã","Lessons from My First Job I am finally rendering the last week of my very first job.

2023-10-19 17:19:15,Text-only,Shout-out sa St. Luke's - wala kayong awa sa Nurses nyo.,"This is not my story. Kwento to ng kababata ko (Magkumpare Father nya and erpat ko) ‚Äã Galing abroad ang kababata ko, tawagin natin syang Bev. Nagtrabaho sya sa government Hospital sa Middle East. Bumalik sa Pinas, nagpakasal, bumuo pamilya nagkaanak (inaanak ko) at nagdesisyon na mag stay na lang sa Pinas, since maganda nman trabaho ng asawa nya. Nag-apply sya sa St. Luke's natanggap ang nag-start din agad.   May isang buwan na training sa St. Lukes for new hires. Pero tangina, wala ni isa sa tinuro ng isang buwan na yun ang nagamit sa actual practice.  May buddy system sila ng another 1 month, pero yung ka-buddy nya hindi nman nagtuturo or walang chance magturo kasi daw ""hinihiram"" sya ng ibat-ibang senior sa group nila para tumulong magbuhat at kung ano-ano pang task na supposedly hindi dapat sya ang tumutulong. In short, dalawang buwan nasayang sa kanya dahil wala sya natutu g for 2 months na pwede nya i-apply sa actual. Sabi pa nya ang laki daw ng pinagkaiba policy-wise ng St. Luke's sa Hopital na pinagtrabahuhan nya sa middle east. Ang dami daw na unnecessary steps. And to add, hindi to about skills, about lang to king pano gagawin yung trabaho nila based sa practice ng hospital. So after 2 months training binigyan na sya ng patient na ihahandle nya ng solo. first day ng yung dapat na 8 hours duty, naging 14 hours sa dami ng dapat gawin at wala man lang seniors ang umalalay or willing umalalay sa kanya. sa 14 hours na yun, wala syang naiinom na tubig or makakin ng kahit ano. One time nag-lunch sya, hi ap at pinagalitan daw sya ng Manager nila kasi daw 8 hours lanbg ang duty walang lunch break. (literal kasi na 8 hours ang duty nila like 8-4PM, hindi gaya ng usual na pag 8 hours duty usually 8-5, 9 hours tlga kasi may 1 hour break sa kanila straight talaga). Minsan umabot na ng 12 hours na wala syang kain at inom, nagpaalam lang syang uminom, pero after 2 mins hinahanap na agad sya ng manager. in 2 weeks of working sa ganitong environment nakapag adapt nman daw sya, yung dating 14 hours umaabot na lang ng 10 hours in her 2nd week. pero OTTY sya kasi sabi ng manager nya, hindi daw acceptable na reason for overtime since INEFFICIENCY LANG DAW TO SA PART NYA"" Last shift nya, nag break down yung kababata ko habang kumakain ng ""dinner"" 2AM sa mcdo.

Para sa St. Luke's - Tangina nyo.","Shout-out sa St. Luke's - wala kayong awa sa Nurses nyo. This is not my story. Kwento to ng kababata ko (Magkumpare Father nya and erpat ko) ‚Äã Galing abroad ang kababata ko, tawagin natin syang Bev. Nagtrabaho sya sa government Hospital sa Middle East. Bumalik sa Pinas, nagpakasal, bumuo pamilya nagkaanak (inaanak ko) at nagdesisyon na mag stay na lang sa Pinas, since maganda nman trabaho ng asawa nya. Nag-apply sya sa St. Luke's natanggap ang nag-start din agad.   May isang buwan na training sa St. Lukes for new hires. Pero tangina, wala ni isa sa tinuro ng isang buwan na yun ang nagamit sa actual practice.  May buddy system sila ng another 1 month, pero yung ka-buddy nya hindi nman nagtuturo or walang chance magturo kasi daw ""hinihiram"" sya ng ibat-ibang senior sa group nila para tumulong magbuhat at kung ano-ano pang task na supposedly hindi dapat sya ang tumutulong. In short, dalawang buwan nasayang sa kanya dahil wala sya natutu g for 2 months na pwede nya i-apply sa actual. Sabi pa nya ang laki daw ng pinagkaiba policy-wise ng St. Luke's sa Hopital na pinagtrabahuhan nya sa middle east. Ang dami daw na unnecessary steps. And to add, hindi to about skills, about lang to king pano gagawin yung trabaho nila based sa practice ng hospital. So after 2 months training binigyan na sya ng patient na ihahandle nya ng solo. first day ng yung dapat na 8 hours duty, naging 14 hours sa dami ng dapat gawin at wala man lang seniors ang umalalay or willing umalalay sa kanya. sa 14 hours na yun, wala syang naiinom na tubig or makakin ng kahit ano. One time nag-lunch sya, hi ap at pinagalitan daw sya ng Manager nila kasi daw 8 hours lanbg ang duty walang lunch break. (literal kasi na 8 hours ang duty nila like 8-4PM, hindi gaya ng usual na pag 8 hours duty usually 8-5, 9 hours tlga kasi may 1 hour break sa kanila straight talaga). Minsan umabot na ng 12 hours na wala syang kain at inom, nagpaalam lang syang uminom, pero after 2 mins hinahanap na agad sya ng manager. in 2 weeks of working sa ganitong environment nakapag adapt nman daw sya, yung dating 14 hours umaabot na lang ng 10 hours in her 2nd week. pero OTTY sya kasi sabi ng manager nya, hindi daw acceptable na reason for overtime since INEFFICIENCY LANG DAW TO SA PART NYA"" Last shift nya, nag break down yung kababata ko habang kumakain ng ""dinner"" 2AM sa mcdo. Umiiyak sya kasi kahit grab wala syang mabook. And mind you this is a mother of 8 months old baby. Natural mamimiss nya anak nya. Sobrang naself-pity sya buti na lang yung asawa gising pa at naghihintay sa kanya at sinundo sya agad.

When you do your interview di nadi disclose na they will hire you as an independent contractor. Worst is I know this employee who was only aware na 3mth contract lang pala siya nung Job offer/Contract Signing na. No disclosure whatsoever. SINASAYANG NIYO LANG ORAS AT PANAHON NAMIN! Sana di na namin ki cel yung ibang offer samin. Independent contractor ka daw pero required ka pumasok sa Philippine office nila  the fuck?!  NO BOUNDARIES. Stated in our contract is the hours of work that we need to render. Pero they're expecting you to work your ass out until matapos mo yung task mo matulog ka man o hindi. ALL YOUR overtime IS NOT PAID! Kahit na urgent or biglaan. May nalalaman pang blended AU and Philippines holiday pero pag may deadline ka walang holi-holiday. Holiday sa pinas pero di kasama sa holiday na pre-selected, hindi ka double pay. Holiday sa AU na di pre-selected? Wala kang double pay  information technology FEELS LIKE YOU'RE WALKING ON EGGSHELLS. No room for improvement. Isa'ng mali pag mumukhain kang napaka tanga, pag iinitan, ima-micromanage tapos biglang tatanggalin. Magugulat ka yung kausap mo ng umaga wala na sa station niya ng hapon. ksksks talk about employee morale. Kada buwan may tinatanggal na tao, key performance index yata nung racist na chief executive officer na mag tanggal ng at least 3 people sa Philippine team kasi he thinks we're disposable.

They also told her na maging confident pagdating sa bagay na yan dahil confident din sila sa skills na meron sya. Maraming pwedeng ebidensya, like payslip, and yung previous employer nya.

I've had no problems for the past few months, except sa 3 days return to office na wala sa initial kong contract. But this week was special: they announced a team outing* sa Enchanted Kingdom. Tapos, yung team leader namin, she asked sa GC ng department kung may hindi raw ba makakasama kasi nagfi-final count na yung human resources para siguro sa tickets. Initially, gusto ko namang sumama e. Pero I heard from a friend outside the department na parang gusto ng boss, isang bungkos kami pagpasok ng EK, like, bawal magkaroon ng sariling agenda or humiwalay. So sabi ko hindi na lang ako sasama, together with 2 other co-workers in the same department. Nagulat kami, biglang nagpatawag ng urgent meeting yung HR. Pagpasok sa call, galit na galit agad siya. Wala raw kaming utang na loob sa dami ng considerations (bare minimum) na binibigay sa'min ng company namin. Tapos kami raw, isang araw lang na outing, ayaw daw naming sumama. I was like??? Didn't they ask us kung may hindi ba sasama? I figured information technology was a yes-or-no question, and that we have an option to say no. Hindi naman sinabing mandatory pala.

It's a small company, kaya kilala namin lahat ng employees. More or less, nasa 30 lang kami. I've had no problems for the past few months, except sa 3 days return to office na wala sa initial kong contract. But this week was special: they announced a team outing* sa Enchanted Kingdom. Tapos, yung team leader namin, she asked sa GC ng department kung may hindi raw ba makakasama kasi nagfi-final count na yung human resources para siguro sa tickets. Initially, gusto ko namang sumama e. Pero I heard from a friend outside the department na parang gusto ng boss, isang bungkos kami pagpasok ng EK, like, bawal magkaroon ng sariling agenda or humiwalay. So sabi ko hindi na lang ako sasama, together with 2 other co-workers in the same department. Nagulat kami, biglang nagpatawag ng urgent meeting yung HR. Pagpasok sa call, galit na galit agad siya. Wala raw kaming utang na loob sa dami ng considerations (bare minimum) na binibigay sa'min ng company namin. Tapos kami raw, isang araw lang na outing, ayaw daw naming sumama. I was like??? Didn't they ask us kung may hindi ba sasama? I figured information technology was a yes-or-no question, and that we have an option to say no. Hindi naman sinabing mandatory pala.

Again, this is from my personal experience. But I'd like to read the perspective of others.",148,22,0.99,Tips üîî,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/zhdjpj/things_that_ive_learned_in_my_career/,zhdjpj

2023-05-16 18:42:28,Text-only,Fuck all of em,"Six months in and they decided to extend my probation instead of regularizing me. When human resources summoned me at 9 am in the office, the human resources head told me that my boss gave me a low evaluation and decided to extend my probation. Soon after signing the letter of acceptance of extended probation, the human resources head told me to never tell what we talked about to anyone, the only ones who know are the human resources Department (consisting of only 4 people including the head), me, and my boss. I sat outside contemplating about what happened. Soon my boss sat near me and consoled and asked what happened inside. I told him that my probation was extended, and he was all like ""Luh bakit ganun, regular ka na sa evaluation ko sayo ah, bakit nila iniba decision ko"" and he gave common lectures about human resources being the enemy of employees. A little detail about my boss, he had 5 different wives, 5 eldest kids, and is unmarried. He fucked a coworker of mine who has 2 kids and a husband working abroad. Now then about our accomodation, the company provided us a staff house. The only residents of the staffhouse are me, my boss, the mistress coworker, the new guy, the first company employee, and the boss' bf/right hand man. One time 2 months before the extension of probation, when my boss and the mistress publicly labeled themselves as ""friends"". The new guy, and the 1st employee wasn't staying for a while in the staffhouse. information technology was only me, boss, and ""rightie"". Rightie told me to gtfo the staff house because the boss told us so, I asked why, he told me a random woman. I didn't believe him at that time so I didn't take his reasons seriously and left. So I was forced to go home from Cainta to Bulacan all of a sudden. The president of the company called that night and asked me why i wasn't in Cainta, I told him "" Sabi sakin may iuuwi daw syang babae eh, malay ko sir, un lang sabi sakin kaya pinaalis kami"" (I didn't know that information technology was the mistress during that time). So the next day when i went to work, the boss called me midday and told me why i told the pres, and the human resources head that I ""tattle tailed"" him and he forced me to leave that night. I told him i didn't speak negatively about him, and just told the boss that what I said to the pres. There were 2 new employees in our company 2 months before my extension - Ackie, and Newbie (the new guy mentioned a while ago); And just a while ago I heard they were gonna get regularized by the orders of my boss. I wasn't bitter with their regularization, I was happy for them because they deserve it. I was bitter for the management's decisions. So imagine this, 6 of us in the staffhouse - me, the boss, the mistress, rightie, newbie, and the first employee ""firstie"". Firstie was relocated to Bicol so that leaves us 5. The boss does all the scheduling and designation of sites so he scheduled Newbie in the 2nd shift (4 pm to 1 am), so Newbie doesn't stay in the staffhouse throughout the night. So that leaves us 4. Rightie fully follows the boss' orders, so when he was ordered to take the 11 pm to 8 am shift he fully followed. So that leaves the 3 of us in the staffhouse for the night. He couldn't find a way to get rid of me.  I could feel that they are irritated that I was blocking them from living together. I'm pissed that I am voluntarily doing paperwork at home during the weekends, and I still haven't been regularized, and why because I was cockblocking my boss in the staffhouse? I got a feeling that after the extension, no matter how much work my ass off, my boss will either end my contract or extend my probation again where he knows I will feel disrespected by information technology and forcefully resign.","Fuck all of em Six months in and they decided to extend my probation instead of regularizing me.

Rightie fully follows the boss' orders, so when he was ordered to take the 11 pm to 8 am shift he fully followed. So that leaves the 3 of us in the staffhouse for the night. He couldn't find a way to get rid of me.  I could feel that they are irritated that I was blocking them from living together. I'm pissed that I am voluntarily doing paperwork at home during the weekends, and I still haven't been regularized, and why because I was cockblocking my boss in the staffhouse? I got a feeling that after the extension, no matter how much work my ass off, my boss will either end my contract or extend my probation again where he knows I will feel disrespected by information technology and forcefully resign.",141,91,0.95,Story üó£Ô∏è,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/13j1lj0/fuck_all_of_em/,13j1lj0

Background lang kay Edith She's with the company for 3 years now. Laging above average ang Performance Evaluation ko sa kanya. And wala din akong masamang personal experience with her. Laging on time sa submission ng reports, na-aacomplish on time yung mga ad hoc task. Di mahilig mag-OT kasi natatapos nya work nya on time. I short, magaling si Edith. So, back to the meeting with human resources biniyan nya ko ng set of papers consisting of exit interviews from resign employees (from other department), and one of the reason daw na nagresign yung 7 na employess (in a span of 8 months) is because daw super daw ni Edith. Meron ding mga insident reports na binigay sa akin about Edith shouting back at other managers. And human resources is planning to fire Edith and need ng signature ko. I have reservations kasi, una, mawawalan ako ng magaling na staff. Pangalawa, although I get ung malakas ang  boses ni Edith, I think it's because sya typical na probinsya g sa y magsalita ng high-volume.

Halimbawa may need syang report (for her to be able to do her report din) and alam nya na due ang report na yun today, straightforward nyang sinasabihan yung staff like ""due kasi yan ngayon, so dapat, kahapon pa lang tapos na para nareview na ni boss mo ngayon"". I get na medyo bitchesa si Edith, but ""firing her"" shouldn't be an option agad-agad di ba? So I said sa human resources na, I'll talk to Edith about the other manager's grievances. Yun lang.

May pa-uso sila na pagdating ng out mo, need mo bumunot ng isang special task bago ka magout. What The Fuck out ka na nga may extra task ka pa imbis sana na ipapahinga mo nalang pauwi sa jeep. Kala mo naman may bayad. Napaka random nung task and information technology can range from easy to hard. Easiest siguro would be cleaning the center island or tamang punas lang sa ibang station or refill lang ng utensils. Hardest would be cleaning the grease trap or bathroom or maglampso sa buong dining area. Mapapakamot ka nalang since wala naman yong bayad. Isa pang kaputangenahan ng managers is yung pag may excess yung kitchen na nalutong pagkain na maglalapse na tas biglang naubos yung peak ng customer. Pipilitin kang bumili ng manager, salary deduction naman daw. Syempre ikaw naman na patay gutom at pagud na pagod sa pagttrabaho, maeengganyo ka sa pamimilit nila. Wala kang no choice. Di bali sana kung may discount. Bat kaya hindi sila yung bumili? Samin pa ipapabili alam namang kakarampot lang ang sahod namin. Last nalang. Alam kong at fault din kami ditong mga crew pero please hear us out. Itong mga walang magawang manager na to. Kinuntsaba yung mga regular crews na pai  kami. Naglagay sila ng untouched food sa isang table. Yumburger ata yun + C1. Tapos kaming mga dining nagtataka bakit 1hr mahigit na wala pa ring customer na gumagalaw sa table na yun. Kala namin naiwan ng customer. Policy kasi dyan is if matagal na unattended, need na i-clear yung table. In short itapon na yung ano mang natirang pagkain dun. Syempre kaming mga crew ulit na patay gustom,  ghihinayang kasi di naman na galaw eh bat naman kailangan itapon. So itong isa kong katrabaho, itinakas tapos dinala sa storage room. Tinimbrehan kami na isa isang pumasok para kumagat doon sa burger. Kinabukasan pag pasok namin, burado na mga schedule namin. Sisante na daw kami. Tong mga damuhong manager at crew pala, pinapanuod kami sa cctv habang nagtatawa . Di ko sure kung nasa katwiran ba ko pero di ko maiwasang sumama yung loob. Di naman kami nagnakaw, bat nila kami kailangan pai  ng ganun. Being a manager alam naman nilang nagpapakahirap kami para sa kakarampot na sahod since most of us gaya ko ay working student lang naman. Ano bang mapapatunayan nila sa pagpapain ng ganun? na patay gutom kami? Wala naman kaming ninakaw men. Di ba nila naaalala na kami yung sumasalo pag may sobrang nalutong food para maging perfect yung rating nila sa waste, na may extra tasks kami every time na mag oout na sa work , na kahit anong utos nila ginagawa naman namin.

There is no job description in linkedin so i applied since they are a healthcare company in the USA and may experience ako, but when they interviewed me, halfway ng interview, they said they require someone with an experience ""with this and that"" so we ended up ending the interview and i was told again that i will be reprofiled. We would have avoided a lot of trouble on this one if they just bothered to check my resume first on whether or not i'm qualified for this position before calling me.

Manager said ok (wala kaming HR). After a few hours nag-email sa kanya ung ex-manager namin na nasa Australia na ngayon (pinay, shobet ni boss). Bakit daw nagtatanong about salary increase, sobrang unprofessional daw yon. MATUTO DAW MAG-ANTAY. Shookt kaming lahat hahaha Wala rin naman nagawa manager namin kasi kapatid nya yung ex-manager na yon. Awa ng d'yos wala na ako sa company na yon.

First thing pagpasok namin sa interview room nila, she started talking about how I look. Asked me bakit hindi daw ako nakaayos. I asked her what does she meant sa nakaayos, sabi lang niya you know yung mas kapalan mo ba yung make up. Yung pumuputok yung blush on, thick red lipstick, and so on. Sabay sabi niya ""Hope you're not offended"", i still didn't mind it. We then proceeded sa interview, she asked few things, kung ano na mismo nakalagay sa resume ko reason for leaving.

She then told me napunta siya sa human resources recruitment couple months ago, that she wasn't part of human resources before. She had a different role in the same company before which is far from being HR. I wanted to say na ""I can tell"".. I didn't wanna sound rude so I stayed quiet.

2023-06-23 2:02:09,Text-only,Nightmare interview,"I‚Äôm currently job hunting and I applied to one company I saw online, all looked good they offered a decent amount of salary for a 5 day work week and noted that people with degrees are preferred (I‚Äôm undergrad but I have years of experience na plus a couple of years sa college) I passed my resume and may sinagutan ako dun na question sinabi ko na undergrad ako para lang heads up. After a while, they responded quickly. I was pretty surprised because most recruiters took very long time to respond. So I scheduled an interview with them. Nung day ng interview slight kinabahan ako and I dressed up decently para professional ofc kahit mainit nag blazer parin HAHAHA so ayun malayo ang nilakbay ko papunta doon sa company apakatrapik pa. Pag dating ko dun nagulat ako kasi parang ang hirap puntahan ng location tapos sobrang factory. U g nag brief interview sakin is yung human resources staff yata nila na mabait naman, after that sabi niya sakin boss naman mag iinterview. Dito na nagsimula yung worst interview na naranasan ko. Yung u g questions ng boss okay pa e. simple saan ako nakatira and normal questions na maririnig mo sa isang job interview. Pagdating sa experiences ko dito na nagbago. Nakalagay kasi na I'm doing a part-time social media related job. Like kahit isang oras lang sa isang araw yung work (which I explained naman with her), gets ko naman na gusto nila focused sa work sa company nila. Aba'y sinabi ba naman na 30 mins lang nga lang lunch break nila para focused sa work and hanggang saturday ang pasok paano raw ibang work ko kasi wala na ako pahinga nga ng weekend baka pumasok daw ako na stress, pagod na nga rin sa commute at baka magkamali raw ako sa work. Di raw dapat nagkakamali sa work. I just said na lang some reassuring answers na di ko nga gagawin sa work time ung hustle ko and explained ulit na di need ng malaking time doon. Ito na yung pinakamasakit, pinag usapan namin about sa free lance ko. Ang ending tinatanong niya kung paano raw ako pinagkakatiwalaan ng mga clients ko kasi wala naman akong degree. Hindi ba dapat daw mas naghahanap pa sila ng may degree kasi mas katiwa-tiwala yun? Yung freelance ko is about taxpayer assistance lang na tutulungan mo ung mga tao na maglakad ng iba't ibang transactions nila sa BIR. Undergrad naman din ako ng BS Accountancy and nasa pamilya ako ng mga CPA kaya alam ko and confident ako na kaya ko yung work na iyon. Then comes sa salary, ang offer talaga sa job posting is 25k, bigla na lang niya sinabi na di niya raw mabibigay yung 25k kasi pang CPA raw yun and di pa nga raw ako graduate. Like What The Fuck offer nila sa CPA is 25k?! Tapos sinabi niya pa na kaya raw sila naghihire kasi umalis daw ung mga dating empleyado. Wala naman daw sila magagawa dun pero sinayang lang daw oras nila sa pagtrain tapos di rin magtatagal. Uhhhhh. After that, binuklat niya ung resume ko ang dami ko raw nilagay. Eh ang nakalagay lang dun is work, educational bg, and importang infos like 2 pages lang siya and di pa kalahati yung second page. Padabog niya rin binuklat, nalaglag pa nga pen niya sa sahig. Nung ti ong kung may questions pa raw ako sa kanyam sabi ko wala na kasi nga nasagot na ung gusto ko tanong sa ugali at pakikitungo niya sa akin. Wait ko na lang daw ng ilang days kung ano result. Sa  gyaring parang pangmamaliit sa akin alam ko di ako tatanggapin nito. Then I received a text after ilang days, na pasado ako at offer na nga. Binabaan lang sahod and may paalala pa na bawal mag side hustle sa working hours and lagi tandaan ung work sched na 30 mins break, Mon - Sat. I need to confirm daw within 24 hours, gusto ko magreply na tatanggihan ko and just be honest but traumatized pa rin sa naranasan ko and ended up ghosting them. Yung job post pala is 30+ days pa nakapost. Which means tagal na di pa sila nakakakuha ng bagong hire. Sensitive lang ba ako or talagang unprofessional yung ginawa sa akin? Ngayon ko lang naexperience to sa 9+ years ko working and undergrad. in summary Had a job interview tapos yung boss ay may out of bounce questions and comments about me working freelance in tax, having part time social media hustle and me being an undergrad.

Stop giving information technology the responsibilities that should be in your hands. information technology has zero obligation to make you grow. Or pay you your worth. Your company is a customer that pays for your skill, energy, and time. information technology will not negotiate for your maximum worth or even your fair value. information technology will aim for the lowest possible price that will not break your transaction. It's not being evil or oppressive that way. It's just how companies operate - by holding resources steady while minimizing resources to maximize profits.  You, on the other hand, are the person who has a limited number of hours in this lifetime that you can use for work. You are literally selling the best years of your life when you work. To leave the pricing of each minute, hour, day of your life to another person simply because you think that's just how things are supposed to work, is nothing short of allowing yourself to get scammed.  You need to maximize the pay for each minute of your life as much as you can. Maybe if you get enough, you might not need to sell all of information technology and spend more time for yourself, your passion, and your loved ones.  What I'm getting at is this: You have to stop waiting for raises and promotions thinking the yearly appraisals or your ""kind"" manager will eventually notice your hard work and skills and give you your worth.  Make yourself indispensable then milk the ever living shit out of your situation.   You have to actively negotiate more when you think you deserve more.

Tell them how much your team literally depends on your output and knowledge. Tell them what they can get if you stay on for longer if they give you what you want. SELL YOURSELF. HARD. Don't rely on the yearly performance appraisal bullshit. That's a circus to keep people just happy enough to stay for as long as possible. It's not a true negotiation of worth.  If you can let the company know your worth and if the company knows what they're doing, they will be willing to adjust to your demand for equity. True negotiation.  You don't need to threaten them with a job offer from another company to do this. Matter of fact, sometimes those even can get in the way. You will likely get a much better deal when you're still under their good graces than when you're blackmailing them for a counter offer.  You can always just say the truth: if you like where you are, tell them that you want to stay but you think you can get more for doing more. Companies aren't idiots in general. They know losing people will cost them more money in the long run because they lose tenured resources and have to spend more money to headhunt, screen, and train.

2022-11-29 14:48:47,Text-only,Recruitment process na inabot ng 12hrs,"long post ahead! Irita ang ateng niyo ahaha Pumunta ako sa office ng company na to for interview and pre-employment assessment kahapon. Ang scheduled time ko ay 9 am, I was there at exactly 8:45 am. Kinausap ako nung guard and pinagstay sa meeting room nila. I'll be honest, hindi maganda ang building nila. Lumang luma na kasi, tipong pwedeng gamitin na place for shooting horror films ang aura nung lugar. The only good thing is, ang lamig ng aircon nila. After a few minutes, dumating yung human resources nila, pinagtake ako ng mga assessments and pina-fill up ng ilang forms. Nasa 6 na exam din ata yun, if I remember correctly. Nung umabot ng 12 nn, Pinag-lunch niya muna ako tas pina-resume nalang yun exam by 1 pm. Natapos ako magsagot by 2 pm. Tapos ti ong ako ng human resources nila if may prior commitments daw ba ako this afternoon. Kasi yung magi-interview daw sa akin which is yung human resources Head ay mamayang 3 pm pa ang usual na dating. Take note na yung human resources Head na yun ay anak ng owner ng company na to. Kaya understandable na late ang pasok. (Ganun nga ba talaga kapag anak ng owner or ikaw owner, you have the authority to be late???) Sabi ko sa sarili ko one hour lang naman, kaya ko naman maghintay ng ganun. Tsaka ayaw ko rin naman na bumalik pa, sayang din kasi sa pamasahe. Edi ang sabi ko, sige mag-aantay ako. Kaso lumagpas na ng 1 human resources mahigit, wala pa rin. Syempre at nakapag-invest na ako ng isang oras na paghihintay, nagantay pa rin ako. Inupdate ako nung human resources ulit, sabi malalate daw yung human resources Head, pero na-inform naman na niya na merong for interview na naka-sched. Kaso wala pa rin, mga 4:30-ish saka lang nagdecide yung human resources na yun na i-initial interview ako. Maayos naman yun usapan namin. Kaso ang nakaka-inis sana sinabi niya agad na hindi pasok sa budget nila yung asking salary ko. Kaya lang naman kasi talaga ako pumunta sa company na to para makita if mas malaki ang offer sa akin compared sa isang company na binigyan na ako ng Job Offer. Bale nalaman nga nung human resources na yun na malaking factor sa decision ko ang salary. Sana hindi niya na ako pinaghintay pa para mainterview ng human resources Head nila. Pero dahil sa napaka-patient ko, to the point na nagmumukha na akong tanga. Naghintay pa ako ng mga 1 hr. Sabi ko sa sarili ko last na yun. Kapag wala pa, uuwi na ako. Kaso nung time na dapat uuwi na ako, mga magsi-six na siguro yun. Saka ako tinawag for interview ng human resources Head nila. Edi ayun pumunta naman ako. Sabi niya gusto niya raw ako kasi kita raw na serious ako sa job. Kasi nga naghintay ako ng matagal. Edi ako naman smile smile ahahaha kahit gusto ko na siya sapakin. Bi ggit niya pa na gusto niya rin daw ako kasi committed daw ako. Kasi magiging breadwinner daw ako ng family ko. Sa point na sinabi niya yan sure na sure na sure ako na ayaw ko magwork sa kanila. Kasing pu porket ba panganay na anak at freshgrad ganyan ang tingin? Gigil ako eh, desisyin siya masyado. Tas hindi ko na babanggitin yun iba pang napagusapan namin, pero ang bottomline masyadong too much daw ang asking salary ko at eto lang ang kaya nila ibigay. Ehem 16k ehem  Sabi niya magwait daw ako ng 5 mins at babalikan niya ako, iinterviewhin daw kasi ako ng sister niya, which is yung chief executive officer ng company nila. Edi si tanga, payag naman ako. Kasi 5 mins lang naman. Nakalipas 5 mins, ininform ako ng isa sa employees nila. Ang sabi magwait daw ng 20 mins kasi kakain pa raw si CEO. Pu** di ko na kinaya. Sabi ko pwede po bang tomorrow nalang kasi mga 6:30 pm na yun. Kahit pa na never na ako babalik if pumayag sila dun sa sinabi ko. Sabi nung employee na inform niya raw yung CEO. Mga ilang mins lumipas, may pumasok sa room. Iinterviewhin daw ako, part siya ng board of directors pero hindi siya yung CEO. Edi ako ngiti-ngiti lang kunwari di ako pinaghintay ng matagal. Kaso yung ""interview"" na yun, ginamit lang to buy time. Parang dalawang tanong nga lang ang natanong niya sa akin tas nagkwento na siya. Pu di ko naman kailangan yun. Nagkwento siya ng buhay niya and kung gaano kahirap yung position na ina-applyan ko. Naexperience niya raw kasi yun. Basta information technology took 20 mins na naglelecture siya, ako oo lang ng oo. Kasi I have to be polite hahaha kahit gusto ko na talaga umuwi kasi pu** nila. Tapos nakalipas ang 20 mins mahigit, dumating si human resources Head. Ininform ako ng balita na nakakapu* talaga. Sabi ba naman sa akin, occupied na raw yung position na ina-applyan ko. Ang hinahanap na raw nila dun ay someone na may at least 5 years of experience. Edi sana nung simula palang sinabi na sa akin para hindi nasayang buong araw ko sa kanila. Diba!?!?!? Though, may open position daw sila na iba. Maging personal assistant daw ng chief executive officer nila. Kinonvince ako na maganda raw yun. Sa loob loob ko pu* niyo di naman yan yung gusto ko na trabaho. Nabanggit din nung human resources Head na bagay daw ako dun kasi nga patient daw ako. Lalo na at perfectionist daw yung sister niya na yun at  inigaw. No thank you po. Ayaw ko maexploit at masigaw sigawan.  Ang ending wala akong napala. Nakauwi ako sa amin mga mage-8 pm mahigit na. Tangina halos 12 human resources kinain para lang sa wala. Nabbwisit pa rin talaga ako every time na naaalala ko. Ang maldita ko pero sana mabankrupt sila. O sana di nalang palagi masarap ulam nila. Nakakainis kasi. UPDATE: Ngayong 8:50 pm, nag-reach out sa akin yung human resources Head ng company. Iniinvite ako ulit for interview sa December 1. Ano kaya ang mas nakakainis matanggap mula sa akin? No response at all or ireject ko saying na I have found a much BETTER company? Hahahahaha.","Recruitment process na inabot ng 12hrs long post ahead!

2023-01-20 10:07:31,Text-only,"A guide on immediate resignations, absent without leave and abandonment","* Reposting this guide that I posted on the other sub. Figured that information technology might come in handy for AntiworkPH just so people are covered in case they are planning to resign. Adding a line or two as well about health concerns as a cause for immediate resignations * So lately I‚Äôve been seeing some posts on this sub about what happens if you choose to go absent without leave or file for immediate resignation for whatever reason. Thought of writing this simple guide for everyone on the implications and next steps should you decide on passing your immediate resignation for whatever reason. FIRST, why file for immediate resignation? As the name implies, immediate resignation is the voluntary resignation of an employee with immediate effect. However, one cannot simply pass their immediate resignation and expect information technology to be valid without them incurring liabilities to their employer. For your immediate resignation to be valid, your reasons must indicate just causes as the Labor Code provides. Actually, if may just causes ka nga, hindi mo na rin kailangan magpasa ng resignation letter. SECOND, what are just causes for immediate resignation? According to the Labor Code, these are just causes for your immediate resignation:  serious insult to the honor and person of the employee; inhuman and unbearable treatment accorded the employee by the employer or his representative; crime committed against the person of the employee or any immediate members of the employee‚Äôs family; Other similar causes.  Na-estafa ka ng employer mo? Pwede ka mag resign immediately. May libelous statements na ginawa ang employer mo against you? Posible kang mag resign kaagad. Kinulong ka via padlock ng employer mo sa opisina? Resign na yan. Di mo na matiis yung trabaho? May iba ka  g opportunity na hindi makapaghintay? Na-insulto ka na mababa ang pasahod sayo? Wait lang, hindi ka pwede mag-resign kaagad. Mag-render ka muna ng 30 days notice mo para wala kang sabit. If wala kang just causes pero di mo na talaga matiis and nagfile ka ng immediate resignation, the employer can consider you as absent without leave which can be grounds for abandonment. THIRD, what‚Äôs absent without leave and abandonment? absent without leave - as the name implies, it‚Äôs being absent from work without properly filing for a leave; information technology can be just one instance or habitual instances of being absent from work without following company guidelines. Abandoment - a failure to report to work or absence without valid or justifiable reasons; there must be a clear intention to sever the relationship with the employer. Magkaiba ang absent without leave and Abandonment. While absent without leave is not automatically Abandonment (since going absent without leave just means na hindi mo sinunod ang company policy for being absent), information technology can lead to Abandonment if may balak ka talagang umalis na sa employer mo. Being terminated for going absent without leave is also different from being terminated for Abandonment, FYI. FOURTH, what are the implications if you‚Äôre tagged for Abandonment? Okay, the burden to prove that you abandoned your job falls on the employer. However, they can consider you terminated if they‚Äôre able to prove that you did, in fact, abandon your post. Termination is not an easy matter, though, as the employer also needs to do their due diligence and afford you due process. FIFTH, how can an employer terminate you for abandonment? As evidence of abandonment for an employer to terminate you, the employer must attempt to contact you several times through different mediums (such as your personal and work emails, contact number, and last known physical address). If hindi ka magrespond to any of these and documented siya ng employer, the next step is to formally provide you with a Notice to Explain, an administrative hearing, and if di ka pa rin sumipot, your notice of termination. LASTLY, what are the implications if na-terminate ka for abandonment? Like any other instances where an employee was terminated for neglect of duty or other issues like harassment, wala kang separation pay. Irerealease lang rin ng employer yung 2316 mo and COE but hindi rin maganda yung record mo if your future potential employer conducts a thorough background check. While your 201 file is sealed and considered confidential information by your previous employer, information technology doesn't mean that the human resources of your previous employer will not reveal your reasons (or lack thereof) for leaving during a background check. You can opt to not include the previous employer in your CV when applying for a new job, but again, your future potential employer can find out about your stint in your previous company when checking your SSS, etc. records. There are instances as well that an employer can seek damages, depending on your contract (especially if there are provisions regarding breach of contract; I‚Äôve seen a few contracts where employers stipulate damages that are worth 6 figures, but this is an extreme case). -- If wala ka namang just causes for immediate resignation, best to render at least 30 days pa rin or negotiate a shorter window with your employer. BUT what about health concerns? Are they valid for immediate resignation? However, this doesn't mean that health reasons are strictly invalid. The same goes for mental health concerns. Proper documentation is crucial. Note that there might be a bit of negotiation required here as well since not all employers will be willing to bend the 30-day notice period as required by law.  In this case, proper documentation of your health reasons and a plan to facilitate the proper turnover and clearances will be crucial here. In short, health reasons for immediate resignation are on a case-to-case basis. ** EDIT: What are the implications for a regular employee vs a probationary employee? Okay, so if regular employee ka na, all the provisions stated above apply. However, if probationary employee ka at nag-decide ka mag immediate resignation without just causes, here are possible scenarios that can apply to you:  Employer will still require you to render 30 days as prescribed by law just so you can finish work and do your proper turnover and clearances. Employer can offer to negotiate a shorter window for your notice period if they're kind, lol. If nag pakatigas ka sa immediate resignation mo without ""just causes"", the employer can consider your status as ""not regularized due to abandonment"", meaning hindi mo napasa yung probationary period bilang umalis ka. This would still require a paper trail though, such as the employer trying to contact you through several mediums.

You'll get a more objective perspective not cluttered with politics. Beyond that, information technology depends on what kind of help you need:  If what you need is to vent: turn to your best friend outside of work, a partner, parent, or counselor. Often, just getting the issue out can help relieve the burden. If the issue is work politics: much of information technology just needs venting, but more experienced friends or mentors in other companies are great resources for advice on playing that game. If your concern is so deep that you are concerned for your own mental health: turn to a counselor. Many larger companies provide them at no charge, and they are quite ethical about not leaking inside the company. Outside of the company, you could ask your doctor or the local community mental health resources for a referral.

2022-05-31 16:25:49,Text-only,"I wanna hear your ""walk out"" stories","Nag walk out ka ba sa interview? Sa job? Sa boss mo? Sa office? Share natin kasi small win natin to. Me first! Story 1 Nag apply ako sa isang startup sa Philippines but the chief executive officer was a foreigner.  Day 1 - Interview with chief executive officer agad (kasi startup nga) was scheduled at 2pm. I was there at 1:40pm. 2pm, wala pa. Sige, baka late lang. Then, sabi sa akin ni human resources na delay lang daw si chief executive officer and can I wait some more? Sabi ko, sure. Ito  gyari until 4pm then human resources told me resched na lang and she was super apologetic about it. In hindisight, red flag na nga but I really thought their company was impressive and baka nga may unavoidable emergency si CEO. Day 2 - Arrived at 1:40pm again. chief executive officer didn't arrive until 2:30pm and then proceeded to HANG OUT in his office. His office was a glass wall so I saw him typing some stuff on his laptop and even talked to a few people. I was sitting directly outside his glass office so kitang kita ako and he knew I've been waiting. Naalala ko naka stretch pa paa niya na relaxed. 3:30pm, I fucking walked out sa harap niya. information technology was so disrespectful and a waste of my time. Hinabol ako ng human resources but I said sorry, not interested anymore and this was very unprofessional. They tried to resched me for a 3rd interview but fuck that. I think intentional power trip move yun ng chief executive officer for some reason.

Ano ""walk out"" stories niyo?","I wanna hear your ""walk out"" stories Nag walk out ka ba sa interview? Sa job? Sa boss mo? Sa office? Share natin kasi small win natin to. Me first! Story 1 Nag apply ako sa isang startup sa Philippines but the chief executive officer was a foreigner.  Day 1 - Interview with chief executive officer agad (kasi startup nga) was scheduled at 2pm. I was there at 1:40pm. 2pm, wala pa. Sige, baka late lang. Then, sabi sa akin ni human resources na delay lang daw si chief executive officer and can I wait some more? Sabi ko, sure. Ito  gyari until 4pm then human resources told me resched na lang and she was super apologetic about it. In hindisight, red flag na nga but I really thought their company was impressive and baka nga may unavoidable emergency si CEO. Day 2 - Arrived at 1:40pm again. chief executive officer didn't arrive until 2:30pm and then proceeded to HANG OUT in his office. His office was a glass wall so I saw him typing some stuff on his laptop and even talked to a few people. I was sitting directly outside his glass office so kitang kita ako and he knew I've been waiting. Naalala ko naka stretch pa paa niya na relaxed. 3:30pm, I fucking walked out sa harap niya. information technology was so disrespectful and a waste of my time. Hinabol ako ng human resources but I said sorry, not interested anymore and this was very unprofessional. They tried to resched me for a 3rd interview but fuck that. I think intentional power trip move yun ng chief executive officer for some reason.

Somehow, later part of last year, ung ugali nilang pagkareligous was affecting like if may Di ako natapos na work, sasabihin nila na Whatever you do, work at information technology with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for human masters. Nainis ako dito and Sabi ko sobra ung work loads kulang ang Tao! Ayun Sabi nila ginagawan Naman Ng parang. Eh putcha pag nagiinterview sila, after interview nilalait nila mga candidates so wala halos nahahire.

Sabi nya puro bunganga Lang daw ginagamit Ng team leader ko and chismis Lang ginagawa sa office which was nakakatawa. At the back of my mind, both team leaders na religious are nagpaplastikan haha. Somehow, later part of last year, ung ugali nilang pagkareligous was affecting like if may Di ako natapos na work, sasabihin nila na Whatever you do, work at information technology with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for human masters. Nainis ako dito and Sabi ko sobra ung work loads kulang ang Tao! Ayun Sabi nila ginagawan Naman Ng parang. Eh putcha pag nagiinterview sila, after interview nilalait nila mga candidates so wala halos nahahire. Sila ung literal na if you can't practice what you preach, better keep information technology yourself.  Yan mga experiences ko sa kanila Kaya medyo lumayo ako sa mga taong ganto.

When looking for jobs, magbase kayo sa Job Description, wag sa title. Kasi titles, especially sa information technology industry, are bull****. Background: I applied to this notorious company on their entry-level Software Engineer role expecting I will be coding and doing development. Instead, I was put in a niche tech stack doing stupid tech support. 0 coding, 100% ticketing and tech support with calls na may halong backoffice jobs like reports. Sobrang niche as in ma-pipgeonhole ka. Narealize ko what I did did more harm than good sa resume ko. I should've gotten out early, kaso the pay was good and I managed to save enough to stay unemployed for about a year. The job has been clawing on my mental health every day since I hate my work everyday, and kada araw parang pababa ng pababa ang chances ko to get an actual development role the more I stay. I am now about to resign, probably unemployed for a few months or who knows baka a year (wag naman sana). Going to finish my portfolio and try to apply again. Wasted 1 year of my career here. Nadapa pero go lang. I think this is the best move, kesa mag atrophy pa skill ko at mastuck sa useless piece of technology na to. Please ingat lang sa predatory tactics ng companies. Hindi lang dito sa company na to, pero talampak siya sa industry. Actually there are now companies that have been lying sa Job Description so mahirap na talaga mapinpoint alin ang legit at alin ang hindi. So bawiin ko sinabi ko earlier. Don't trust titles.

Now most of the time clueless ang recruiter, then red flag na agad yon. Or paabutin niyo sa technical interview then tsaka kayo magask. Don't let these companies prey on talent. Marunong ka magcode pero sa call center ka ibabagsak para ma-appease yung foreign clients ng supply of talented people who are overqualified sa job. This is why you shouldn't trust outsourcing.

Sa panahon ngayon where high-speed computer, internet, office tools, CRM, and AI tools exist, you really think there's no way someone can finish their task within 8 hours? Honestly, the only viable reasons someone shouldn't be able to (assuming they come in time) are:  1.) they have a workload intended for 3-5 persons (which happens a lot in this Godforsaken country unfortunately),  2.) senseless meetings which took away 3-4 hours of their precious time, and  3.) tech problems like nawalan ng Wi-Fi, kuryente, office mainte ce, and other shits that hindered them from working during their allotted work time.  But other than that, a normal workload should be doable within a day.

2023-08-09 21:23:36,Text-only,From 38k to 25k for a blended account in a busy inhouse company. Exploitation malala.,"I'm currently happily employed for another company. This rant is basically after I referred a friend to another friend who's currently working from home. Call Center setting kami, and the company in question is in-house but work from home.  I was aware na 38k yun current package ni work from home friend 1, pero the work is very very busy at gamit na gamit din sya. If queueing sa calls, sa calls siya. If queueing sa chat, lipat sya sa chat and if queueing sa email sa email sya. In short, walang avail time sunod sunod lang na work at para kang pagpapasa pasahan. Friend 1 was a pioneer agent, and did not have to negotiate for her salary.  A friend of hers even quit kasi iniinvalidate nun boss nya yun mental health issues nya caused by work. At dahil work from home they're required to use their own device, maintain and fix information technology if broken and sagot din ng employees other costs like internet at electricity. However, as a practical girly, we are both aware na sakto yun package at 38k for both the salary and the upkeep as well as the opportunity to work from home and workload.  Enter friend 2 na looking for work, with Business process outsourcing experience amongst other jobs she's had. Since nasa malayo siya, we have referred friend 2 sa company ni friend 1. We also set her expectations on the tasks, the environment as well as the salary. Wala kami ineexpect or hinihintay na referral fee. This is all for friendship lang. Imagine my shock when friend 2 was interviewed and she is offered 21-25k only and is expected to perform same job as friend 1. They both roughly had the same work experience. Napaka inhumane. It's so unfortunate that the companies who brag about family at work, competitive salary and employee welfare would exploit workers the moment they get the chance. Expecting their employees to pay for the cost of business, but will pay them bare minimum salary and stress the hell out of them with heavy workload and uncaring leaders. Sana sa mga people here looking for work from home do not agree to this kind of set up. Times are tough pero if a company requires you to use your own device and pay for your own bills to do your work, 25k is a LOWBALL. You can argue na kasi work from home so naka tipid sa pamasahe, but if your device goes down due to heavy apps they use at work and if yun health mo ma compromise due to stress kulang pa yan sasahurin mo. On my first company sa Alorica, I have a very hard working team leader na exploited and generous with her overtime sa company. She got sick due to overworking and was comatosed and billed more than a million pesos. Let's just say Alorica barely paid 10 percent of that bill and she was back to overworking after getting healed. Take care of yourselves and have pride in your work. Do not allow the disrespect to continue.","From 38k to 25k for a blended account in a busy inhouse company. Exploitation malala. I'm currently happily employed for another company. This rant is basically after I referred a friend to another friend who's currently working from home. Call Center setting kami, and the company in question is in-house but work from home.  I was aware na 38k yun current package ni work from home friend 1, pero the work is very very busy at gamit na gamit din sya. If queueing sa calls, sa calls siya. If queueing sa chat, lipat sya sa chat and if queueing sa email sa email sya. In short, walang avail time sunod sunod lang na work at para kang pagpapasa pasahan. Friend 1 was a pioneer agent, and did not have to negotiate for her salary.  A friend of hers even quit kasi iniinvalidate nun boss nya yun mental health issues nya caused by work. At dahil work from home they're required to use their own device, maintain and fix information technology if broken and sagot din ng employees other costs like internet at electricity. However, as a practical girly, we are both aware na sakto yun package at 38k for both the salary and the upkeep as well as the opportunity to work from home and workload.  Enter friend 2 na looking for work, with Business process outsourcing experience amongst other jobs she's had. Since nasa malayo siya, we have referred friend 2 sa company ni friend 1. We also set her expectations on the tasks, the environment as well as the salary. Wala kami ineexpect or hinihintay na referral fee. This is all for friendship lang. Imagine my shock when friend 2 was interviewed and she is offered 21-25k only and is expected to perform same job as friend 1. They both roughly had the same work experience. Napaka inhumane. It's so unfortunate that the companies who brag about family at work, competitive salary and employee welfare would exploit workers the moment they get the chance. Expecting their employees to pay for the cost of business, but will pay them bare minimum salary and stress the hell out of them with heavy workload and uncaring leaders.

From my experience, applying to foreign clients / companies are even better since they only want your resume and portfolio, an interview with possibly a Filipino HR/Recruiter/Department Senior and then finally an interview with the boss and it's done.

2022-10-25 20:32:55,Text-only,Rejected a client's request for screen monitoring,"Short intro. Got hired by a US client, full-time 40 hours per week. Pay is good and all and the client is a little bit old but super friendly during the interview. He only wants someone to work on his social media accounts while he does his business. So G naman and all. Fast forward to 2 weeks later, he sent an email request to download a screenshot monitoring app on my laptop. I checked the app and information technology screenshots your entire workspace (all monitors), monitors your website surfing, and checks the activity rate of your keyboard and mouse. I ignored the email since we were going to have a meeting naman on that day so I planned on talking to him about this. Client forgot all about information technology for another week and so did I. But as soon as na-bring up niya ito during our daily meetings, I asked if he can remove the function for screenshot and website monitoring. I told him I am comfortable with monitoring the work hours (basically logging every task and time) and the activity rate of my keyboard and mouse. He asked why and I told him that since he's not providing a work laptop, I am using my personal laptop to do all my tasks. That means that while I'm working, there  are other windows that are open such as Viber, FB Messenger, Whatsapp, and my personal social media accounts. I mentioned that I'm not comfortable with an app that randomly screenshots my entire workspace since I value my privacy. We never reached a decision. I never settled with downloading the app and he mentioned that it'll be his homework to study the app first so information technology will be better for the both of us. So ano point ko? Wala. Laughing out loud just kidding. Let this be a lesson I guess that it's okay to reject some things at work without arguing or creating a scene. As you can see here, binigyan ko agad siya ng good enough reason bakit ayoko ng screenshot monitoring (pero siyempre of course baka makita niya while working naka open netflix ko lmao). He insisted but I never settled since I'm sure na magiging problem ko siya in the future kapag may super personal message akong mahagip sa screenshot. How about you, guys?

I thought so too during my first 2-3 months. Until the downside presented itself in the form of the most toxic upper management I have ever experienced in my near-decade long career. What do I mean?  Manager has made guilt-tripping, threatening, physical sexual harassment, crude and tactless words a norm in the office, especially in her team. Uses company resources for her own benefit. Asst. Manager is a middle-aged pervert who basically did nothing at work, passing down his tasks to his subordinates, credit-grabs the sh*t out of your work, catcalls women at work and makes r*pe jokes on the daily. HRAdmin specialists and staff who lack empathy towards the people, is the first one to spread false information, backstabs and looks down on shopfloor operators, acts like a god and is inflexible to the needs of the people. Ancient-aged managers who refuse to evolve and improve the system, gossips and bullies verbally, entitled and dishonest; and many more.  Literal na isusuka mo mga kasama mo. I tried, I really tried. The attrition rate for the position I left is abysmal - literally no one would last for more than a year: only I did. Why? I tried to give information technology a chance, I wanted to stay for the people. To help them get through the barrier of the shopfloor-office staff stereotype. But I just couldn't anymore.   I lasted a record of 1 year and 3 months before I got scouted for a higher position in a different province. I felt sad leaving the others, but my mental health and sanity was hanging by a thin thread. But information technology was such a difficult decision, because the benefits were amazing. Looking back as I start in my new company, I sleep better at night now, my acid reflux from the stress and anxiety has calmed down, I'm losing weight slowly and am not craving too much of my comfort food like before. No matter how tempting the benefits are, the environment still matters by a mile.","The Golden Handcuffs I recently resigned from a company wherein, from the outside looking in, it's a really good company.

I thought so too during my first 2-3 months. Until the downside presented itself in the form of the most toxic upper management I have ever experienced in my near-decade long career. What do I mean?  Manager has made guilt-tripping, threatening, physical sexual harassment, crude and tactless words a norm in the office, especially in her team. Uses company resources for her own benefit. Asst. Manager is a middle-aged pervert who basically did nothing at work, passing down his tasks to his subordinates, credit-grabs the sh*t out of your work, catcalls women at work and makes r*pe jokes on the daily. HRAdmin specialists and staff who lack empathy towards the people, is the first one to spread false information, backstabs and looks down on shopfloor operators, acts like a god and is inflexible to the needs of the people. Ancient-aged managers who refuse to evolve and improve the system, gossips and bullies verbally, entitled and dishonest; and many more.  Literal na isusuka mo mga kasama mo. I tried, I really tried. The attrition rate for the position I left is abysmal - literally no one would last for more than a year: only I did. Why? I tried to give information technology a chance, I wanted to stay for the people. To help them get through the barrier of the shopfloor-office staff stereotype. But I just couldn't anymore.   I lasted a record of 1 year and 3 months before I got scouted for a higher position in a different province. I felt sad leaving the others, but my mental health and sanity was hanging by a thin thread. But information technology was such a difficult decision, because the benefits were amazing. Looking back as I start in my new company, I sleep better at night now, my acid reflux from the stress and anxiety has calmed down, I'm losing weight slowly and am not craving too much of my comfort food like before. No matter how tempting the benefits are, the environment still matters by a mile.",69,11,0.98,Story üó£Ô∏è,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/15uf16c/the_golden_handcuffs/,15uf16c
