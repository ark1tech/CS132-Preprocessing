2024-04-20 14:50:31,Text-only,"Dodged a bad company and HR, I guess?","I've applied for one of the subsidiaries of Ab//oitiz and I'd really like to share how horrible the application process (or how the HR handled it, I guess) was.

Bale I just graduated from my electrical engineering degree this January and I've started to apply to a few companies including this subsidiary from Ab//oitiz. When compared to companies I've also done interviews with, like PL//DT, J//G Summit, and S//MC, sobrang nakakadisappoint yung experience ko with A//bo/itiz.

I had my expectations for Aboi//tiz since it was known to be one of the top companies and employers sa Philippines. Kaya siguro naman formal and may class talaga yung way kung paano makipagcommunicate yung HR, right? Kaso hindi. Para bang nakikipagcommunicate lang ako with someone sa isang low-end company who is deeply struggling in handling communications. Ang problema pa rito was that I was the one who was understanding and patient kahit na sila yung may lapses in handling my application.

Three months have passed and they've contacted me saying that my application was already being considered but it was placed on hold due to a problem sa vacancy ng position. With that, I just had to withdraw and say that I wasn't already comfortable with the process and how poorly they we're handling my application. I withdrew kasi baka my application was a hassle on their end pala tsaka baka hinihintay lang talaga ng HR na magbreak ako towards their treatment/attitude.

Nagreply yung HR sa withdrawal ko. Hindi ko malagay exact phrases but here's the gist. HR said the usual stuff muna like ""We're deeply sorry about the inconviences made on your end blablabla sorry to see you go"" tapos ayon sa dulo sinabi na sobrang arte ko raw for complaining and that I should ""man up more"" to understand real-life problems that are being encounted sa office nila. I shouldn't be complaining din daw kasi hindi naman ako employee to ask for something on their end.

What I was just asking for was respect. Here's one (one out of a lot) inconvenience/problem that happened: They asked me to attend an F2F interview sa office nila. The two hour travel going to their office didn't matter kasi I was enjoying my stay sa province namin to avoid the city heat. However, when I arrived then waited for two hours sa lobby, nobody sa division (division ata or department kung saan yung mga mamemeet ko) remembered that I had a scheduled interview. The HR responsible for this was called to have a meeting sa ibang office at a different city so nobody was left sa office nila to where I was to arrange/conduct the interview.

So ayon, ending was that I was asked to go home instead. Forgave them for that kasi understandable na baka may miscommunications sila sa office.

Kaso ayun lang. Binerate pa ako ng HR.",26,2,0.93,Story üó£Ô∏è,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/1c8jhvr/dodged_a_bad_company_and_hr_i_guess/,1c8jhvr

Student Coordinator name nung role, and it sounds nice for me naman kasi I'm going to be assisting students and all tapos remote pa so that's awesome. pero the issue I have is 46 hours a week ako tas paiba iba yung oras nung shift (e.g. 9 hours ako ng M, T, Th and F, tapos 8 hours nang W). tapos may 5-hour shift ako every saturday. so idk, unless super chill nung role, parang ang magiging pahinga ko lang linggo diba :( eh siyempre i need to take care of things around the house rin kasi independent ako ever since 20 ako. not to mention, siyempre i have to take care of my health rin kasi it's also not the best right now haha. ayun, sorry kung sabog ako, dala nalang rin ng pagod at kaba.

2024-04-20 17:34:24,Text-only,Not my fault na mag-oovercompensate ako dahil kakaunti lang kami dito.,"TLDR is yung title. Long story told is:  


Nakakainis pumasok. Mga 2 days na din akong absent and I'm basically asking for a suspension. Warehouse staff ako at mostly preparation ng mga requested box ang gawa ko. Last wednesday, nag-out ako na malinis ang area ko - iilang caster board lang ng box (mga 15 box ) ang nakalagay sa may harapan ng area ko. Pagbalik ko ng Thursday ng umaga, parang binagyo at sabog sabog ang nandoon na mga box lalo na sa harap.  ""Kaya to matapos hanggang OT"". Bandang 2 ata, dumating ang Head na Hapon at nakasalubong ko. Puro continouos ang request ng box kaya tumambak na sa harapan. Isama pa yung mga box na naandoon na, punong puno ang harapan.  


Nag-aayos ako ng mga box noong parang may narinig ako na tumawag sa akin. Lumabas ako pero akala ko yung iba pang katunog ng pangalan ko ang tinawag kaya bumalik ako sa loob para mag-ayos ulit. Tinawag ako ng OIC at medyo naiinis ata na hindi ako lumapit agad. Sinabihan ako na 'wag masyadong pabalik balik at tapusin muna ang isang bagay bago pumunta sa isang lugar para naman sa iba pang bagay. Ang ginagawa ko kasi, prepare ng box at palabas ng box, magpapasok ako ng bagong dating box at magsosort, tapos prepare ulit. Rinse and repeat. Tama nga naman na medyo kalat kalat yung mga box. Pero naiisip ko, kung hindi ko gagawin iyon, dadami nang dadami ang tambak sa akin. Nagsabi ako na dahil nga nadagdagan ang gawain ko dahil sa mga Nightshift. Wag ko daw isisi. Nagrason ang ""leader"" namin na kesyo nga kakaunti din ang tao sa kabila. Galing ako sa kabilang shift at palagi silang nakaub-ob kung walang ginagawa kaya nga tumatambak ang mga box. Di na lang ako nagsalita. Kapag galit ako, mas binibilisan ko ang kilos at bina-block out ko lahat ng mga bagay kaya hindi ako makausap. Nagdecide ako na mag-out ng 6 imbes na 7. Naabutan ako ng OIC na paalis at tinanong ako kung mag-oout na ako. Parang humihingi ata ng explanation kung bakit at nahahalata na naiinis ako sa nangyari. Nagsabi ako na kesyo pawisin na at maglalaba tapos tumalikod ako para pumunta sa Biometric. Gusto ata gumawa ako ng presentation at sinabihan ako na nag-uusap pa nga daw. Bumalik ako sa area ko at pinicturan ko ang nakita ko na tulugan na nakatago sa mga boxes na nasa harapan ng area ko. Hindi ako pumasok ng biyernes at baka ""kausapin"" ako. Teambuilding dapat ngayong sabado pero hindi ako kasama. Iyon pala minove sa linggo kaya eto, 2 days akong absent.

Medyo wala ako sa sarili ko dahil ganoon din noong nasa small Construction Company ako ng stepfather ko at noong nagthethesis ako : pagod na pagod ako kaka-overcompensate sa mga taong wala tapos ako din ang masisisi.   


479 ang rate namin at nagiging 700 iyon with OT. Maliit nga kumbaga pero ayoko ang ""Galawang 479"" dahil nasanay ako na laging gumagawa sa bahay namin kasi kung hindi ay ""Lumayas ka nga dito"" lang ang maririnig ko sa stepfather ko at sa mismong nanay ko. Nagmumukha tuloy akong bida bida sa trabaho. Tapos ngayon nga ito, nasisi ako kahit miminsan na lang din ako nagbrebreak.  


Gusto ko na magquit kung hindi lang ako gipit ngayon sa pera. September 27, 2023 ako nasimula as on-call pero December 1 ako pumirma ng contract sa kanila. Last tuesday lang naibigay sa akin ang uniform. Naghihintay ako maka 6 months nga kumbaga at kukuhain ko na CoE ko at sisibat na ako.",4,1,0.75,Story üó£Ô∏è,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/1c8lxcu/not_my_fault_na_magoovercompensate_ako_dahil/,1c8lxcu

Job 1: Medical field, twice a week duty, 24 hrs per duty. Allowed 1 month VL. Not stressful but super brain-fog. 

Job 2 (new job): HR field, Solo HR, compressed 5 days working (8am-6pm) lots of training shouldered by the management, 1hr away from home, and based on working there for 2 days pa lang naman, very welcoming, humble, and humanitarian yung CEO and management. 
But di ko lang kasi sure if kaya ko i handle less than a hundred employees and ako lang mag isang HR, im sure it‚Äôs going to be stressful. Better salary compare to Job 1.  

So nag start na ko mag work as HR generalist sa Job 2. Hindi allowed sa Job 2 ang moonlighting. Pero allowed naman kay Job 1.
But now, pinag iisipan ko kung mag re-resign na ba ako agad kay Job 1 kasi ang plan ko sana, i-try mag work for a month kay Job 2 and see if kaya/magugustuhan ko para kung hindi, babalik ako sa kay Job 1. Allowed naman kami mag leave sa Job 1 for a month so walang problem kung di ko to papasukan ng 1 month and pwede pa mag extend. Should I take the risk ba?

2024-04-19 13:21:07,Text-only,Work Dilemma whether to resign from my current company or not,"I need advice, comments, and thoughts regarding the situation I'm in right now with my career.

For context, I was unemployed since February. I received numerous rejections from different companies I applied to from February to March 2024. Right now, I've been employed at a company for three weeks. I already received the job offer since most of the companies I applied to mostly just ghosted me when I followed up on my application after the final interview. At that time, I was also waiting for a response from a second company I applied to, but they ghosted me for a month after I had two rounds of interviews last February. 

This was the first company I applied to before applying to the company I'm working for now. In the first week of March, I was assigned a case study for this second company since the HR reached out to me, stating they had to restructure the hiring process, and asked if I'm still interested. I said yes since there was no job offer on the table for me from other companies. Then the HR didn't reply for two weeks about whether I passed the case study or not. 

Eventually, they replied, and I was interviewed by the COO on Holy Monday. That day, the company I'm working for now gave me the job offer, and I only had the whole day to accept it. It was a hard decision since I wanted to wait for the results of my last interview from the second company, but again, the HR kept replying late or might ghost me again, so I took the job offer since it's better to have a job rather than no job at all. But now, it's just my third week at work, and I'm already mentally and physically exhausted since we are required to do overtime four times a week on-site. 

The commute to BGC is really tiring and expensive. The second company gave me a job offer, and the salary is way beyond what I asked for during the interview and far from my current salary. The thing is, I can't just immediately resign from my current company since the policy is 60 days rendering, even though some former employees are requesting immediate resignation due to health reasons, but they won't accept it. It really says a lot about the management and how they care for their employees. Additionally, I'm dealing with a case regarding sexual harassment since I was the complainant, and I talked about this to my current manager and the head of HR, but they weren't empathetic. 

They said that work is work and they are more concerned regarding the KPIs since it's a fast-paced environment.
With that being said, your input will be really helpful for me since I need to make a decision today whether I'll immediately resign or not. And how should I handle the 60 days rendering.

2024-04-19 12:07:33,Text-only,[HYPOTHETICAL] Employer launches new training platform. Requires employees at least 1 hour per week outside of work to take it.,"Hypothetical Scenario (weh?):

  
An employer launches a new self-paced training platform that requires employees to take the training for at least 2 hours per week to keep on track. Of those 2 hours, 1 hour would be during work hours and 1 would be **OUTSIDE** **of working hours**. Employer emphasizes that the more time we dedicate (of which only 1 working hour per week is allowed) to this learning platform, the faster we can progress.

  
Take note:

* The transition from the old self-paced training program has not yet been ironed-out.
* The platform is not launched for all employee levels simultaneously.
* Based on previous experience, the employee launches trainings around Q2 or Q3 of the year which will most likely be busy.
* Based on previous experience, a huge portion of these training are basic concepts you already took in college. 
* These self-paced trainings do not affect your current pay/salary.
* These self-paced trainings DO however AFFECT YOUR ANNUAL PERFORMANCE EVALUATION which also affects the rate of your annual increase. It is 20% of the evaluation.

What say you?

Binigay ni gf pero blurred ang compensation. Sabi ni TL, hindi dapat blurred. So binigay niya na para matapos. Days later, yung ibang TL may sinasabi sa kanya na related sa new sweldo niya. Ang tingin niya, sinend ng TL niya sa boss pa ng naka CC ang other TLs. Allowed at legal ba to????

2nd scenario, naging employee si gf ay June 2022. Come mid 2023, sabi ni company may ibibigay daw ng COLA (cost of living allowance) kasi di daw naibigay. So ang intindi namin ay COLA for 2022. Ang catch, pag nagresign ng until June 2024, babawiin. Nagresign si gf ng Dec 2023. Sa backpay, binawi ang COLA. Pwede ba tlgang bawiin ang COLA kahit na ba technically na earn mo na yun??",3,5,1.0,Company alert üö©,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/1c6xt9n/bpo_company_na_hiningi_yung_jo_sa_lilipatan_and/,1c6xt9n

2024-04-18 17:10:39,Text-only,Is my compensation fair for weekend on-call work setup?,"Does anyone here know what the proper compensation for weekend on-call work should be? I already sent an email to DOLE but I haven't received a response yet. Baka lang may nakakaalam sainyo.

I work 8 hours a day from Mon to Fri, and on some weekends, I'm required to be on call for 24 hours a day. Currently, my company compensates me a minimum of four hours' pay, plus any additional hours worked when called.

For example: 
(1) On a Saturday, even if I'm not called, I would still be paid four hours.
(2) If I logged in at 8 AM for a call and logged out at 10 AM, rendering two hours of work, I would still be paid four hours.
(3) If I logged in at 8 AM for a call and logged out at 2 PM, rendering six hours of work, I would be paid six hours.

Now, my question is, is this compensation fair? Or should I receive a full 24-hour pay for being on-call, considering I have to wait all day in case I'm needed for work? Or kahit 8-hour pay man lang?

This setup restricts my personal time. I can work on-call from my home, but I cannot freely go outside or use my time for my own purposes, given that I would be held accountable for any delays related to work.

The on-call requirement was not included in my original contract, but the company now requires me to be on-call on some weekends in case there are incidents.

If meron may same case dyan, please share your experience. Salamat!",1,0,1.0,Advice Needed ü§î,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/1c6ythv/is_my_compensation_fair_for_weekend_oncall_work/,1c6ythv

What do I mean na ang kapatid ko may speech defect? utal utal mag salita, repetitive words, repetitive phrases, lapses in both oral and written filipino and english grammar pero makukuha mo ung point na gusto nyang sabihin pero may challenges talaga sa grammar kahit itinama na ng magulang, may times na irrelevant ung mga 'irereport' sayo.

What do i mean may autism spectrum? may characteristics siya na kapag kinakausap mo, his eyes look at the ceiling, sabayan pa ng mga characteristics ng mga nasa speech defect, laging secluded or isolated, nagbabad sa computer maghapon doing 2D digital art, mahilig sa mga vaporwave music and the like na music

what do i mean of post traumatic? when he was a kid, nabangga siya ng jeep and nabagok ung ulo, which made him having speech defect today and an identifiable huge keloid on his right foot. meron din siyang characteristic na low self esteem. siguro dahil na rin sa pagpapalaki sa amin ng magulang naming super ultra mega over protective sa amin di kami maka step up.

let us fast forward in 2019 when he graduated in Bachelor of Arts in Multimedia Arts. after nyang grumadweyt, sinubukan niyang mag apply sa isang multimedia company sa northgate alabang, kaso hindi siya natanggap. when pandemic strike, siyempre sobrang hirap makahanap ng work dahil no face to face interactions, more on virtual lahat. nung sinubukan niyang mag apply rin sa isa pang company in makati, hindi rin siya tinanggap. i asked him why. his speech defect-ness. iniisip tuloy ng recruitment kinakahaban siya dahil utal utal siya dahil na rin sa speech defect nya. kaya dahil dyan, i encouraged him to get PWD and present it to any companies na aapplyan niya para alam nila kung saan siya pwede ilagay that would maximize his skills kaso hanggang ngayon hindi pa rin siya nakakahanap. and now i heard na he will be trying call center. i'm speechless na susubok siyang pasukin ang napaka toxic na BPO world lalo pa't lately he acquired getting flipped kapag nacocorner na siya mentally. madalas pa naman sa industry natin sa BPO, especially taking in calls, unang bungad kadalasan mura mula sa frustrated customer. eh paano na lang macorner ang kapatid ko mentally and verbally mag flip si kapatid towards the customer over the phone? edi elbow. kadalasan pa sa mga hiring process at hiring postings, mga voice or blended accounts (pero 90 per cent voice, masabi lang blended kasi hindi 100 per cent voice account). sabi ko sige try mo mag call center training sa tesda, baka pwede at palarin kahit may speech defect, autism spectrum at post traumatic stress spectrum siya.

sinubukan na rin nyang mag online job, mag sub-contract. oo nagkaroon nga, once lang. digital logo earned less than P5000. then poof wala nang sumunod.

i'm getting upset with our current situation lalo na ang hiring selection. are PWDs with speech defect not allowed to grow professionally and personally kahit may ample skills naman sila liban sa oral communication? I wanted him to be a somebody na we can be proud of. I wanted him na he will be earning his own money para kung mawala man kami sa mundong ito, he can survive with his own money. ayaw ko kasi umasa na lang siya later sa kamag anak dahil baka iba maging trato sa kanya.

i dont know if this is the right place to ask on behalf of my sibling na trabaho na fit for him.

2024-04-18 10:11:16,Text-only,Salary Deduction ,"

About 3 months ago, I was promoted to Quality Officer in a BPO company. 

The promotion itself has trails of documents and emails explicitly confirming my promotion (role, responsibilities, salary, internship date, etc.) which I've compiled since. 

The Quality Leader to whom I was to report informed me at the time that I am yet to start as they still need to fill the headcount for the said role. 

Two months went by without me performing the duties of the role I was promoted to whilst receiving
the internship pay.

It was only after today during a meeting with management that I've found out that I wasn't suppose to have received those payments as I, according to them did not assume the role. 

During the meeting, they've admitted that it was a mistake on their behalf for not noticing and I should not have received the documents in the first place. 

I was also informed that the payments were to be reduced to my salary. 

The only problem is I'm about to resign from the company and cannot afford any pay deductions considering how large it was. 

For those of you who've been in a similar situation, what do you think?

Will I stand a chance given the proofs I have, if I am to report this to DOLE?

It was like I made the contract to them that I will be giving services in an exchange of money (independent contractor sila) na hindi mababawasan ng tax, so buo ko siya makukuha.

After reviewing that JO, I immediately ask if magkakaron ba ko ng incentives or benefits from the principal company, then they stated na ako na daw yung mag-ask sa kanila since hindi daw sumasagot as of the moment.

Then, I also noticed na walang nakaindicate na Project There was no specific campaigns, or goals na kailangan kong mahit before the possibility of being absorb or end of contract. It only stated na my contract is for a year and I will be working for them.

I am literally confuse right now and alam kong may mali since I am project-based employee but there's no project kaya hindi ko na din muna pinirmahan yet I am working with them as of now.

I decided to ignore it until I forgot about it. Then yesterday, I started receiving numerous calls, which I assumed were interview calls.

Then she asked, ‚Äúsan kaba nakatira‚Äù! With the higher tone!  which was annoying. I told her to call back later because I had errands to run. She asked when she could call again and what time, and honestly, I wanted to block her, but I realized she was using a different number. It‚Äôs obvious this is a scam!

2024-04-16 22:38:13,Text-only,Need help should I start fresh or get COE,"Hello, sorry for posting this here kasi I don't know what to do kasi and medyo. For context:

4 years ago I went awol sa first bpo company ko (I was a VA before ako nag apply sa bpo kasi gusto ko magka insurance and para maexperiece ko din yung company settings since VA ako after graduating college), I stayed for 4-5 months there. 

Naaksidente ako before I went awol, napilayan ako sa right foot ko to the point na umabot na siya pagiging kulay violet-itim at medyo gumapang na din yung pain sa tuhod ko. Nagpacheck up ako and binigyan ng medcert, pinasa ko sa TL ko ng Abay that time yung medcert at picture ng paa ko, binigyan niya ko ng go signal para mag rest din at siya na daw magsasabi sa actual TL ko yung nangyare. 

after ilang araw nagchat sakin actual TL ko na pinilit ako pumasok at hindi daw accepted yung medcert ko at hindi niya daw ako magbibigyan ng LOA. Sobrang nakakafrustrate that time kasi hirap na hirap ako maglakad talaga at pinilit ko na lang. Kinausap ko TL ko non at nakita niya nga lagay ng paa ko, sabi niya hindi daw talaga accepeted  yung medcert ko at may mas malala pa daw sa sitwasyon ko na nakakapasok pa. Kinausap kami ng OM that time at nag irrevocable resignation ako (mind you na nakapagdecide na din ako magreresign kasi sobrang toxic the whole process and I felt unsafe for my wellbeing sa kanila).

Hinatid ako ng kuya ko para magpasa ng immediate resignation kasi hindi ko na talaga kaya sobra yung panggigipit nila at pressure sakin that time. Hindi tinanggap ng HR yung letter ko sabi sa TL o OM ko daw ibigay.

After that hindi na ako pumasok ulit umabot ng almost a month bago gumaling yung paa ko at nagkaron ako ng extreme anxiety dahil sa kanila kaya nagpahinga ako mag work, nasaktuhan naman na pandemic din. 

Ngayon nag ttry ako mag apply ulit and nagpapasa pasa, hindi ko lang alam kung dapat ko ilagay sa cv ko yung ex company ko or start fresh na lang with my VA exp. Sabi din ng friend ko na matagal na sa bpo na wag ko na lang isama, pero naiisip ko yung record sa philhealth at BIR.",0,0,0.5,Advice Needed ü§î,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/1c5hpvj/need_help_should_i_start_fresh_or_get_coe/,1c5hpvj

2024-04-15 17:16:50,Text-only,Uncovering Tax Evasion of Global Tech Giant in the Philippines,"Spilling the tea on a global tech brand with office in BGC‚Äîallegedly switching legal name to avoid taxes. Not hating but something's brewing.

It's a story of alleged tax evasion, where the company is said to have engaged in a peculiar dance of legal name changes, seemingly to evade their tax obligations in the Philippines. But what's truly intriguing is how this maneuver seems to benefit certain employees, particularly those of Chinese employees.

Now, before we dive deeper, let me be clear‚ÄîI harbor no ill will towards the hardworking employees of this company, regardless of their nationality. In fact, it's quite the opposite. Many Chinese employees reportedly enjoy hefty salaries of 300k-1M pesos, and here's the kicker‚Äîthey're allegedly tax-free.

But let's pause and ponder: How can such a discrepancy exist? How can some employees enjoy the sweet nectar of tax exemption while others carry the burden of financial responsibility? It's a question that raises eyebrows and stirs murmurs among those in the know.

As the truth begins to surface, it's evident that something isn't quite right in the halls of this global tech giant. So, sinetch itey. üçµ",57,13,0.96,Rant üò°,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/1c4hrss/uncovering_tax_evasion_of_global_tech_giant_in/,1c4hrss

So I applied and got accepted to this known company in the country. I was excited lol. They asked me if I can use my personal laptop for my first week of work, since they were still 'requesting' a work unit for me. I gave them my laptop specs, and they replied that it wasn't enough. I'm aware that it wasn't tho, and I told them about it. I'm a creative so they said that I should use high-end unit so that I can use editing apps smoothly. I agreed, and they advised that I should sign a 50-50 payment agreement so we can purchase a new unit. I was not aware ha, na magbabayad pala ako para sa work laptop?! Sinabi lang nila once I already signed a job offer kaloka. So ang mangyayari is idededuct nila sa salary ko every payday yung 50% amount ng bagong laptop, since another 50% ay sila ang magshoshoulder. Sorry pero sobrang low ng salary offer nila sakin pero inaccept ko padin kasi nga ""known company"" baka madami ako matutunan. Actually di ko naman need ng bagong laptop since meron na ako, and yung gagamitin pang work sana naman provided ng company? Since last few companies ko sila fully nagprovide ng work unit. And sabi nila once I resigned daw, ibabalik sakanila ang laptop and yung binayad ko monthly parang yun daw yung lease payment ko, so parang nirentahan ko pa.

Add ko lang din: sobrang strange na wala silang HR. From start to job offer, yung head ang kumakausap sakin. But they are a well-known company promise. Walang HR? And another thing is walang interview. I'm thankful na wala actually, pero kinda sketchy for me.

Confirmed na known company sila, and hindi sila scam I'll tell you that.

Super super disappointing lang on my part. Now, I'm thinking of withdrawing my application. Possible parin kaya yun?

Also, l'm not sure if l'm just dramatic pero diba parang matic naman na company-provided dapat yung work unit, and not 50-50 payment? Hays.

2024-04-12 12:55:09,Text-only,OJT being bullied by officemates. ,"TLDR: Title. (warning: super long post ahead) (another warning: idk if this belongs here, pls kindly tell me nalang if it doesn't, i just really wanna know your insights) 

So I am currently rendering my OJT and at first akala ko it would be great but it was the full opposite of great. My workmates were kind at first but overtime, they showed their true colors. For context, matatanda na sila like 40 up. There are times na sinasabon nila ako like ginagauge nila yung ""yaman"" ko (i'm middle class lang naman) just because OJT palang daw and nakalatest iphone na ako and branded bag. They went so far as to ask about my siblings' salary, position, where we live, what businesses we have, etc. Akala ko naman nung una okay lang kasi bago pa ko baka curious lang but it didn't stop - when I went to another country for a certain concert they asked me magkano ticket, sino nagbayad, saang hotel and what airlines like why do you have to know? 







So at first naassign ako sa admin, and so I was doing admin work. Scan here, photocopy there, and everywhere. Minsan taga stapler ng papel, taga tanggal ng stapler, taga alis ng paperclip and what have you. There's also this one time na pinagawa sakin ng isang officemate ko yung blue book nya for notary. 500 documents arranged AND handwritten sa book na yon. You can imagine yung nakalagay don sa hinandwrite ko, name of parties, witness, ID number, etc., 500 of that in one book. Eh tatlong libro nya pinagawa sakin yun. Edi okay, yes lang nang yes kasi pabibo ko e. Tuwang tuwa naman sila sakin. One time, tinanong ako if gusto ko na ba sa company na to maregular (usapan namin at first ay iaabsorb ako that's why sakanila ako nagpunta), umoo nalang ako kahit deep inside ayaw ko kasi walang ginagawa masyado, no growth talaga. Sabi ba naman sakin, ""oo, dapat ganyan ka lang oo ka lang nang oo sa utos para maregular ka dito"". ??? ano ako puppet ??? 



 One time, may pinascan sakin and nagkamali ako when marami na naprint, my other officemate shouted at me like literal na shout kasi rinig na rinig ng ibang dept eh sabi nya ""ako na nga! nabbwisit ako sayo mali mali naman gawa mo!"" edi okay. i let it pass, di ko pinatulan. pero after that, I went to the HR manager and asked to be transferred departments because hindi ako naggrow sa current position ko. and while I know it may sound demanding, unpaid internship to and knowledge talaga habol ko.... ano makukuha ko sa pagsstapler na knowledge? haha. pero di ko na minention yung pagiging toxic, i thought kakayanin ko. not until nakalipat na ako ng dept and kung ano ano ginawa nila sakin. 













everyday nalang may issue. sa suot ko, porke paiba iba daw ako ng damit. sa paglipat ko, porke magpphotocopy lng din naman daw ako dito. btw, that's not true at all. dito, natuto ako magprocess ng documents, nakakausap ako ng clients, natututo makipagcommunicate with government offices and nalalaman pano gawin ang mga bagay bagay. 


anyways, ayun nga inaattack talaga nila ako. one time an officemate told me ""ganda ng suot mo ah pero naka motor ka LANG naman."" Ok? And? Anong mali sa motor? Ngayon naman I heard them saying na kaya lang naman daw ako nagpalipat dahil ayaw ko matuto. There was also one time na may pakain na donut and sabi sakin kalahati nalang daw akin. And simula ng nalipat ako at nabigyan ng sariling office, lagi silang nagpupunta sa harap ng office ko (transparent door), and tinitignan ano ginagawa ko. Malas naman na lagi ako naabutan na tapos na sa work so pinagkakalat naman nila ngayon e natutulog lang daw ako sa office. 





Ang dami pang iba like sobrang hostile ng treatment sakin pero tiniis ko lahat kasi kailangan e. But now na I'm nearing the end of my OJT, tapos na ko makisama. Now, I wanna know your insights. I have documented everything (screenshots, voice records, video, pic, etc.). May karapatan ba ako to report this? May maiiwan pa kasing mga OJT after ko, and I badly wanna break the cycle. Even my boss and other departments - same ng kwento sakin, na ganyan talaga sila.



I'm just wondering if pasok ba to sa Right to a Safe Space or what? What do you think I should do? 









P.S. I talked to the HR manager already about this, and sabi nya lang sakin ""Ganyan talaga ang buhay. At least now you know. I'm not sorry for your situation."" so talking sa HR would do no good. I'm thinking about coming straight sa executives as I have their contact naman. 


P.P.S., sorry for the format I'm on mobile.

2024-04-12 20:06:33,Text-only,Title or Compensation? Also shifting jobs to a client?,"Been on my 1st company (an foreign-based company with around 100+ employees in SEA) for almost 1.5yrs now as an Engineer, currently earning a base salary of 20.5k Pesos and they annouced last week they would elevate my position to a Senior role by the start of May due to ome of our seniors resigning. The elevation would come with a training in a foreign country and possibly a 1yr bond with it. Would probably get an increase to around 25k or 28k if I'm lucky enough haha. But due to the nature of this company, more on the implementation/construction side, work-life balance is almost non-existent din and the stress is slow building up on me even on a lower role. Handling around 5 sites at times, supporting and teaching junior engrs despite being a junior myself based on the yrs of experience.

Now there is this other company which is a client of ours aswell and been working on a project for them since the start of the year. It is a well known government based company in Manila, and you've probably seen this company anywhere. They have been offering me to apply for an outsourced engineering position for the job I'm currently working on for them for around 36k as per the Engineer I've spoke to. The nature of work would be diffrent as it would be more on the operations and project management side instead of being the one implementing. I've told the engineer that I want to focus on developing projects more over than the operations side if I am to apply for the said role, in which he did agree, knowing that I'm really after the experience. The application in this company usually take 2-3 months to finish.

The problem now is wether I choose to stay on my current company and take the senior title, training, and 1 year bond but probably end up with a lower compensation or choose the other offer with a higher offer but as an outsourced engineer. Also comparing the commute, my current company is based in Pasig which is farther that that in Manila as I'm currently staying in Sampaloc, Manila which is far better both in time and money.

As I've also mentioned the other company is alsonour client, it may be a bit awkward to tell this to my current employer. Would like to know more tips on how to handle this types of things too.

1. Hindi ako nakapagdownload ako ng copy ng contract ko and QA rules so I was thinking if sa conference wala akong copy nyan, mag go pa din ba yung case?

2. I was terminated without notice. That same night, sinabihan lang ako na huwag ng mag log in. 

3. As for my QA reviews, I received final written warning in one of the opportunities but the cleansing period is 90 days, unless makareceive ako ng isa pang failing QA anytime, that it the only time na magdedeliberation sila if for termination ako or not and I have not received any failing QA reviews on that same opportunities for two weeks prior my termination.

4. If sa Cebu ang location ng office and nasa Rizal ako, paano ang decision making noon sa case? What will happen if hindi sila magshow up sa scheduled conference twice, may schedule na kasi for first conference sa April 18.

2024-04-12 02:26:02,Text-only,Healthcare BPO Shrouded Misdeeds in the Call Center Sector - Featuring Sagility,"
As Labor Day shines a glaring light on the workforce of the Philippines, it exposes the unsettling truth lurking within the call center realm, with Sagility emerging as a juxtaposition of excellence in healthcare services and a harbinger of labor malpractice.

Beneath the veneer of professionalism and the crucial domain of healthcare assistance lies a narrative of bias deeply woven into Sagility's core. The recruitment procedures, the inaugural interaction between employer and employee, are tainted by whispers of partiality and discrimination, overshadowing competence and sowing seeds of discontent from the very beginning.

For those navigating this skewed path to employment, the assurance of timely remuneration often fades into a harsh reality of wage delays. This not only destabilizes financial security but also exposes a troubling disregard for the fundamental rights of laborers. The weight on an employee awaiting a belated paycheck transcends mere oversight; it epitomizes a blatant neglect for the sustenance of the workforce.

More alarming are the accounts of unlawful dismissals, a specter of uncertainty looming over every employee. This anxiety is exacerbated by the purported acceptance of sexual misconduct, a reprehensible stain that corrodes the essence of the workplace. These occurrences, often swept under the rug and veiled in silence, not only victimize the workforce but also embody a corporate ethos that values profit over the welfare of its people.

Rather than standing as a beacon in the healthcare sector, Sagility appears to capitalize on the vulnerability of job seekers, many of whom feel compelled to endure such hardships. The company's operational approach, seemingly prioritizing cost efficiencies over ethical standards, casts a foreboding shadow over its integrity and sparks vital dialogs on the sustainability of such business paradigms.

This Labor Day, the clarion call for transformation reverberates loud and clear. Entities like Sagility must be held answerable for their deeds. Merely pursuing economic prosperity at the expense of moral decay is untenable. The time beckons for industry-wide metamorphosis, stringent regulatory surveillance, and a unified stance against the exploitation of Filipino laborers. While we laud the toil and commitment of the workforce, let us pledge to shield them from predatory behaviors. The valor of a flourishing industry ought to be gauged by the respect, equity, and dignity it bestows upon its workforce.

2024-04-11 11:44:03,Text-only,I'm tired of working for this company,"Created this burner account because I don't want to use my main reddit account. lol  
So I'm a developer from this company(you can guess what company) for 3 years na. Got lucky to get a project that aligns sa role ko, but now that yung hybrid setup nila is more strict, need na pumasok at least 4x a month which is so draining in my part. I live in the province btw and it's a 12-15 hours trip to manila. for my hybrid set up I opt to go 4 days in one week since I have to comply, may pa check in narin kasi na application if nag office ka on a certain day.

Going for the 4 days straight in a week set up, here's my routine. Travel from my province before the work day at night after shift via bus, then on the next day after arriving sa manila go to office without rest (wala naman makakaalam di pa naligo haha). Then after work check-in on some cheap hotel then checkout for the next day, and repeat until last day of office week.

They probably didn't plan this stupid hybrid setup well, since i go to office struggling to find a seat to find out someone is seated there, note that seats can be reserved but still difficult specially on thursday and friday where majority of employees like to go to office on these days.

Does the company pay my travel expenses? NO!

So here's my experience of why I'm so tired na.

Sahod ko is 0 after this office trip, since wala ako titirahan sa manila i have to check-in on a cheap hotel, my expenses on food and water goes to convenient store food just to not go hungry for the day. don't even force me to find a place to rent since I'm a dev i need a place with stable internet preferably my own ISP, i dont want some random public wifi, and at this time and situation in manila I feel it's impossible to find a place to rent.

Personal life has been a rollercoaster. I'm a breadwinner and giving allowance to my sibling who is studying in manila, thankfully they're set to graduate in a few months. Another is i have a parent that has a medical condition that of course needs money to be treated i.e. maintenance medicine etc., not just this, I my self also take meds to be specific psychiatric meds, let say i have depression i wont disclose further details. with this hybrid setup yung financial stability ko is going down the drain.

That concludes my story haha, gusto ko lang share while i contemplate if makakahanap ba ako ng new work, preferably remote since in my experience ngayon that manila feels like hell and will become worse. I have two 2nd round interviews atm and hope i proceed to the next phase.

2 weeks ago sabi sakin ng supervisor ko magpasa na raw ako by April 9. So basically he already gave me an assurance that I'll be regularized. 
Last Saturday yung pinakaboss nakita ako sa station ng workmate ko na admin kasi nag aask ako ng details about sa regularization (eiya nag aasikaso non). Foreigner siya so di niya naiintindihan pinaguusapan namin akala nakikipagkwentuhan lang kami. At that same day piniem ng mga leads yung dalawang kausap ko, ako hindi. It was only a couple of minutes talking to my co worker tapos they had to schedule a meeting that same day.
nung pumasok ako after our day off (April 9) I messaged my supervisor about the details ng regularization form na ipapasa ko sa website then suddenly sinabi sakin na di raw ako ireregular kasi nakita raw ako nakikipag chat lang sa iba ???
Then pinapunta ako sa HR, even yung HR di makapaniwala, kasi kung d raw mareregular one month pa lang sasabihan na, pero mag sisix months na dapat ako at yun na yung day ng pasahan ng form. Then kinonvince ako na magresign na lang on that same day tas bibigyan nila ko ng severance pay mga 50k+. 
So nagresign na lang ako agad kahit sobrang gulat ako sa mga nangyari. It just fucking sucks, it's so unfair, it's so stupid and now I have to look for a new job but it's hard to look for a job with the same salary na meron ako sa company na yon. I did my fucking best, kung performance naman eh mas maayos pa trabaho ko kesa sa senior nila. I was forced to resign kasi yung higher up nakita akong nakikipag usap sa katrabaho ko? wtf

So I‚Äôve been in my current company for almost 3 years and I‚Äôve decided to resign because I finally got physically and mentally tired from everything I‚Äôm doing ‚Äî things like biyahe, people you have to work with, demand at work, and all that stuff. I spend most of my time commuting (I live in Taguig and my office is a bit far that it takes me 3-4 hrs to get there and probably 4-5 hrs going home.). 

I barely have time to prepare anything in the morning and at night because I need to make sure I make it to work because I don‚Äôt want to be late. My bf mentioned that I‚Äôve been agitated lately, always sleeping during our dates and  barely having any energy to spend time with him on any activities(bless his patience).

Just a few days ago, I submitted my letter!  But I don‚Äôt have a job yet, all of my leaders are asking me to retract and they kept mentioning that they‚Äôll give me a raise so I could stay and possible rent but I don‚Äôt want to rent and be away from my family since I‚Äôm also contributing sa stuff sa bahay and I don‚Äôt really like the place I‚Äôm working at anymore to be honest.

Problem now is I have to find one ASAP because I have 2 weeks left from my chosen last day and I don‚Äôt have that much of a saving that would last me till end of this year, baka nga 3 months lang e hahahaz

My leaders are still okay with me retracting my resignation pero would you choose ba to be unemployed for x number of months just to rest and find a better opportunity that‚Äôs more healthy or should I just bear with everything till I find a new job?


Edit: adding some addtl info that might help in you guys giving your opinion

1. I perform well naman ata in my job hehe, I‚Äôm given big tasks and I‚Äôm actually in line for a manager position but I don‚Äôt think I want it din kasi I don‚Äôt feel I‚Äôm at that level yet

Isa ako sa mga pioneer. Wala pang HR na pinoy so mga british na HR nag handle sa amin at nag onboard. fYI, ( UK company kami. Probationary period is 3 months lng. Tsaka 3 months ko na and I was sending a meeting invite for probationary and performance meeting in which i extend daw ng 3 months probationary ko since Philippine law require 6 months in which they follow once hindi naregular ng 3 months. I've got worried since nag hire sila ng second batch sa amin. First is 4 lang ang hinahanap. Nalaman ko na 5 na ang na hired at nagsisimula na sila next week. Just afraid dahil bakit 5 yung na hired baka papalitan ako. Pero yung back ground ng company is more on pro employee. I raised it sa HR at manager ko na they will hands on sa mga upcoming performance ko since parang Virtual style ang work namin dahil mga ka team ko mga UK tas nag oonsite lng kami para makihalubilo sa ibang department in which konti kami. Dapat ba ako matakot since 5 ang na hire nila? They will have an option na if hindi mo mapasa ang probationary ay ililipat ka sa ibang project?

2024-04-07 21:33:56,Text-only,Micromanager got worse after I messed up,"I just transferred to a new role for a pioneer team this year. Our boss is also new to managing direct reports but they had previous experience as a project manager. 



SO ETO NA NGA -- Nag VL ako a couple of weeks back and had to turn over my tasks to a colleague. There was one task on my turnover that I emphasized was very critical and needed to be closely monitored during the time I will be away.



Kaso, may iba pa palang issue na sumabog during that time kaya ayun yung natutukan ni colleague. So ending, I had to catch up on the critical task when I came back.



All was sort of well after that, until it wasn't. Granted, I do believe na may lapses ako along the way, and that I could have done most things better now that I thought about it. Pero at the back of my head, pioneer team din kasi kami and I am still learning some of the ropes. There were some things I couldn't have had the foresight nor the agility to react on because it wasn't that familiar to me yet.



So andito na tayo sa part na sumasabog na. Manager kept at it on the chats, asking all the questions. At sa bawat tanong na nasasagot ko, meron siyang mga 2 to 3 questions pa.



Again, since may sabog tinanggap ko yung pag-helicopter niya. Down to the point na naka-bullet form na yung next steps of action ko at tinanggap ko na lang. At bawat galaw ko kinaklaro ko din kung okay sa kanya.



Pero dumating yung time na sobrang hindi ko na kinaya yung micromanaging during the crisis. It reached at point na yung mga ginagawa kong tasks to prevent things from turning worse to worst got affected.. kada chat ni Manager nara-rattle na ako so ending nagkakamali na ako sa mga updates at outputs na binibigay ko.



Nung napapansin ni Manager yung mga mali ko, sinabihan niya ako na ""nagbabago yung mga updates ko sa management dahil nagbabago din yung binibigay mo sakin"". Yung utak ko gusto nang sumagot ng: ""k\*ng ina, kung binigyan mo ako ng onting space kesa chat ka nang chat every 5 mins baka nagawa ko nang tama yung kailangan kong gawin to fix this in the first place.""



Sa last call namin during the crisis, aware ako na nagkaroon na ng tension sa aming dalawa ni Manager, aware din ako na nagreflect yung tension na yun sa tono ng boses ko at some point. 



But this ""sabog""/crisis was not the first time I felt that I was being micromanaged. I already started seeing signs after returning from VL. I knew of the tips/articles on how to handle micromanagers (reverse micro, communicate, etc) pero di ko ginawa before this crisis kasi iniisip ko na baka may pressure din kay Manager as the one leading our pioneer team. But I also really have this strong feeling that my Manager doesn't trust me. At all. Most especially after the crisis that had happened.



\*\*\*\*What do I do next?



May 1on1 kami soon and honestly I don't know whether to still hope for the best. I know I should expect the worst, but that's it. Nung nag request ako ng 1on1 sa kanya tinanong ko kung aware siya sa feedback ng iba about me (malaki daw kasi ulo ko -- just bc I am outspoken and can be blunt if needed) pero sabi ni Manager hindi daw siya aware at wala daw siya pake. Dapat ba ako maconvince? My overthinking brain is spiraling.



Now, just seeing their name, imagining the next time we will talk, already brings me so much anxiety that my head and breathing couldn't handle.



Other concerns:



1. Manager is also strict about the team reporting to the office daily kahit may WFH credits kami. Hindi daw pwede gamitin yun since hindi naman nacommit sa management na may WFH sa weekly schedule namin. But the credits are still part of our comp/ben.

---- On the other hand, Manager is on a 2x a week WFH sched



2. They assign tasks that are out of our JD but are part of their JD -- including coaching other team members.



3. Their micromanaging doesn't end with us but extends also to other cross-functional colleagues. Kapag may task that we need support from those people, iba daw yung tono ng pakikipag usap niya virtually. Parang nag uutos lang sa subordinate kahit same job level.



4. During KPI discussion, Manager started by asking questions to seemingly check-in on me but it sounded transactional. The aligned KPIs were thankfully based on my JD but right after that session, they just went back to delegating tasks that weren't part of my job nor contributory to my KPI.



Ayoko mag resign kasi okay naman ako sa company at sobrang okay ako sa ibang kawork ko. Pero bat ganun si Manager? HUHU",6,5,1.0,Rant üò°,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/1by4mip/micromanager_got_worse_after_i_messed_up/,1by4mip

3am - entered the virtual meeting room 
3:15am - wala pa si interviewer so nagemail ako and told them Im na and waiting for host to accept 
3:35am - no reply so nagemail back ako kasi my gad 3:35am na wala pa!

May mga experience rin ako na hindi maganda like may HR sa isang private company na nagpapunta sa akin for initial interview tapos nagpapunta ulit for the second time na akala ko 2nd interview (nag-email and text sila kaya inassume ko na talagang pinapapunta ko) tapos kung kailan nakapunta na ko dun sa location at nag-commute (2 jeeps pa sinakyan ko) tsaka sasabihin na nagkamali daw sila. Di man lang nagsend sa akin ng regret letter kung talagang rejected ako.

Come March, nahire ako sa isang private company as probi. Malapit lang yung location sa amin at ginrab ko na rin dahil wala pang response dun sa ibang companies na inapplyan ko. In line din siya kahit papano sa tinapos kong course.

Kaya lang napansin ko na medyo mababa yung rating nila sa mga Job Seeking sites at wala pang 4.0. May mga negative reviews din from former and current employees.

Nung app process, napansin ko rin dun sa HR office yung mga kasabay kong employees nila na nagfile na for resignation at nagke-clearance na at yung iba inaasikaso final pay nila. Compressed din yung work week and may mga rules pa pagdating sa clothes and hair color.

After 1 month of working, parang medyo may regret na inaccept ko yung offer to work there at nakita ko yung point kung bakit nga mababa yung rating nung company. Nakasulat sa pinirmahan ko na Monday to Friday yung sched ko kaso sabi gagawin daw Tuesday til Weekends. I have two bosses pa and magkaiba yung KPIs na sinet nila for me. Sa totoo lang parang di ko alam kung sino sa kanilang dalawa yung susundin ko. Yung isang boss na sinabing stick muna sa Mon-Fri sched, biglang hinahanap ako ng weekend (Sat) kahit di pa officially narerevise yung sched ng Tues-Sat.

Gusto niya yata wag na ko magholiday eh. Hahaha.  Sa totoo lang, kahit they're trying to be organized, narealize ko na ang gulo ng sistema nila. Wala pa rin akong laptop til now. Tsaka kapag pumapasok ako sa office, parang ang dull or blue nung feeling. Parang ganun yung nafefeel ko sa working environment/atmosphere. Parang hindi ako ganun ka-motivated or lively na pumasok.

Nafefeel ko rin na may mga ka-team din akong aalis at eventually baka sa akin ipasa yung tasks nila at baka maging one-man team pa ko. Which I don't want kasi feel ko hindi ko rin mamamanage nang maayos.

Aminado ako parang naging desperate din ako because of my financial situation at pagiging unemployed for several months kaya ginrab ko na kahit may mga nabasa kong negative things about the company.

As a probi employee, I need your advice. Should I just finish na lang my probi term then wag na magparegular tapos leave na? Or pilitin kong kahit maka-1 year lang then go na?

Nung una, nag pass ako kasi 18k lang yung offer, and then tinaasan nila ng 20k because nalaman nila sa friend ko na plan ko sanang kunin yung offer na 19k sakin from another company which is along Caloocan lang, but hindi ko rin pinursue iyon.

Now, undecided pa rin me kung itutuloy ko ba yung sa Ortigas for the following reasons:

Cons:
1. Super long distance, 2 hrs away from Valenzuela. 4hrs away balikan. Maraming sasakyan and mahabang lakaran. (Ortigas pasig-Valenzuela) so, if aalis ako ng 6am makakarating ako ng 8am, uuwi ng 5pm makakuwi ng 7-8pm dipende pa sa traffic.
2. 6 days a week duty. + Less time with my pet and loved ones and I really value my time with them. 
3. No work-life balance

Pros:
1. Annually salary increase
2. Quarterly and Christmas bonuses
3. Increase salary once good ang performance
4. I think im going to like working with them due to age level.
5. Work experience in HR field since itong career talaga gusto kong kunin.

Anyhow, masaya pa naman ako sa work ko ngayon at hindi ko pa naman sobrang kailangan mag resign but nasasayangan kasi ako sa panahon na dapat ginugugol ko na sa career na gusto kong pasukin. 

Pls share your thoughts about this, do you think it‚Äôs worth it? Itutuloy ko ba o wag muna?  Like what do you think will happen once na tinuloy ko? May experience na rin ba kayong ganitong issue?

2024-04-05 14:47:39,Text-only,IQ-EQ na walang EQ,"Long story ahead.

This is one of the most unforgettable experience I've had sa isang company sa Pasig na IQ-EQ nung 2019.

After working in Accenture for 2 years, I stopped working for a year because of depression and then once I was ready to work again, I applied for this company.

I applied for a Senior Accountant role, but I told them during the phone interview that as long as the pay is good, I am very much willing to accept other roles na accounting related and kahit hindi senior level.

I was invited for a face-to-face interview and assessment na may english language assessment, accounting assesment, and last yung excel assessment.

I arrived on time. I waited for almost an hour because I was told that the interviewer didn't arrive yet.

When she arrived, we immediately started the english assessment which is naperfect ko since sanay nako sa ganung klaseng exams since madame na ako naapplyan noon pero sa computer to ginawa. Then next is the accounting exam which is Literally the EASIEST EXAM na natake ko sa pagaapply ko, because it was just a basic accounting exam and magtrial balance ka lang then adjusting entries. 

I was told nung start ng exam, na depende sa score ko kung anong makukuha ko if assistant accountant, accountant, intermediate accountant or senior accountant.

Before the exam started, i asked if may extra pen si interviewer since i noticed na yung binili ko is defective and i showed her. Nung nasa exam room na ako binigay niya saken padabog yung pen and paper then pabagsak ng pinto paglabas. I just let it pass. Nung phone interview naman kasi she was really nice. Baka pagod lang. Haha.

Then sure akong perfect yung exam kasi super dali. I waited for an hour before lumabas result and sinabay iannounce sa interview kung anong score ko. I was so disappointed when the interviewer told me that ""i barely passed the exam"" in a rude tone, and i told her if i could see how the exam was checked if possible, since i told her nicely na i believe the exam was very simple and nagtututor ako ng basic accounting sa ex ko and sa juniors noon sa college. Haha. Ayaw niya. Gusto ko lang alamin san ako nagkamali..HAHA

She mentioned na yung score ko is pang assistant accountant lang which is pinaka mababang role and yung salary was super lowballed. If ever daw ang offer lang is 18k wherein nung umalis ako sa ACN nasa 21k na ako after promotion to CL12 and salary increase.  I was shocked. But we continued the interview and she asked me a lot of very rude questions like ""bakit ka umalis sa previous work mo? May ginawa ka bang hindi maganda sa work mo at kaya ka umalis and kaya ka nagstop magwork ng 1 year?, ""why didn't you bring an extra pen for emergency cases? what if i hindi kita pinahiram edi bagsak ka na?"", ""are you willing to work overtime? Kasi di pwede samen yung onda palagi and dapat laging on time pumasok"".

I was like, hello? Sino kaya late sating dalawa ng 1 hr? Madame pa pero i forgot na yung iba. Tapos bes padabog siya gumalaw. Malapit na sana ako mag snap at lumabas init ng ulo ko buti nalang natapos na interview. She said that I passed the interview and next is excel assessment and final interview.

I was told after that na if i'm willing to continue, balik ako ng after lunch for the excel exam. 4 hrs na akong nasa kanila tapos babalik pa ako ulit. I told her na babalik ako pero as soon as I went out of the building, tinext ko yung number ng interviewer na sobrang rude niya and unprofessional and I was really uncomfortable during the entire interview and exam sa padabog dabog niya and etc na I almost snapped sa galit sa kanya. Sinabe ko na di na ako babalik and sana wag nila gawin yung ginawa niya saken sa future applicants nila kasi ang pangit talaga ng experience ko sa kanya. I went there full of hope na finally mukhang nakakita na ako ng maayos na company ulet then biglang disaster pala. Haha  Sayang mukhang magandang company pa naman. Haha. ü§£ Binlock ko din number niya before she could even respond and para akong nabunutan ng tinik after that. Haha.

2024-04-04 22:40:09,Text-only,Maglalabas lang ng sama ng loob dahil sa nangyari sa akin dati,"Lumipat ako ng company na pinagtratrabahuhan (from this kilalang IT company to a multi-national oil company). Ang rason ko para lumipat ay dahil sa laki ng sweldo na inooffer.

Pero nagkamali ako ng desisyon.

Sabi nila, dun sa company na yun, may work-life balance. Mababait ang tao. Naloko nila ako.

I was bullied at work. May mga ‚Äúalpha females‚Äù dun na pinaparinggan ako, kesyo ‚Äúwala daw akong magiging kakampi‚Äù, ‚Äúalam namin rate mo‚Äù, etc. (pasigaw yan ah). As in kinakawawa ako. Pati mga kasamahan ko na lalaki, nakikisali sila dun. Tahimik na nga lang ako dun, dami pang ginawa sa akin na masama.

After a few months na nagstay ako sa company na yun, di ako makatulog ng maayos. Kada darating ang Sabado, dun pa lang ako nagiging maligaya. Kapag darating na ang weekdays, parang hinahatak ko sarili ko sa kama. Dumating sa punto na parang susukuan ko na yung buhay ko, tipong magpakamatay.

December ng 2016, nagpacheck-up ako sa psychiatrist. I was diagnosed with clinical depression and anxiety.

Lahat ng kaibigan ko ng college, iniwan ako. O mas pinili ko na din na iwan ko sila kasi iniwan nila ako nung kailangan ko sila. Nung babang-baba na ako sa sarili ko, mas pinili nila na di ako pansin para maging ‚Äúmature‚Äù daw ako at harapin ko daw yung masamang nangyayari sa akin. Ganun na pala definition ng mga kaibigan ngayon? Iwan-iwan? Haha!

Nagresign ako sa company na yun at sinabi ko na nagkadepression ako dito. Sabi ba naman ng pinaka-boss namin dun, ‚ÄúMababait naman yang mga kasama mo tsaka yang sila K####a, sadyang strong women lang sila. Tsaka yang depression mo, di naman dahil siguro sa company yan. Baka dati pa yan‚Ä¶‚Äù

Ede wow, pagtanggol mo pa. Gaslight pa more! Strong pla yung kapag wala kayo at nakatalikod kayo, nambubully ng kasamahan porket bago? Lol

Nagresign ako agad agad, walang ipon. Walang lilipatan. Nakatambay lang ako sa bahay ng 2017.
Feeing ko talo ako nun. Pabigat. Lalo na yung meds ko para sa depression at anxiety, inaasa ko nun sa nanay ko. Nahihiya ako.

After a month or two nung nagresign ako, yung company na yun nagkaroon ng campaign about mental health. Kita ko sa LinkedIn at FB Page nila. HUWAW? Apply-apply din natin sa real life yung mga ganyan ano? Manong alisin nyo yung mga culprits ng mental health issues dyan? Haha!

Ngayon, happy ako at thankful kay Lord kasi binigyan nya ako ng magandang trabaho, mababait na mga kasama, at company na inuuna ang work-life balance at mental health. Naisip ko na baka pinagdaanan ko yun dahil si Lord tutulungan din ako!

Lesson learned sa akin at sana matutunan natin lahat:

1. Huwag papasilaw agad sa laki ng salary na inooffer ng kabila kung naghahadali sila maghanap ng employee. Always ask the HR bakit open ang position;

2. Ask kung mataas ang attrition rate nung team na papasukan mo dapat. Lagi nyong tatanungin sa interview bakit nabakante yung posisyon na yun. Yung kaso nung akin may umalis din pala na same position ko, at one month pa lang sya. (Jusq HR, di pa ba kayo nakakahalata ng problema sa existing na tao ng team na yun?);

3. Okay lang na mag-burn ng bridges sa mga kaibigan lalo na kung di sila maganda sa mental health mo at ang gusto lang nila at ‚Äúhappy-happy‚Äù lang, kahit kasing tagal pa as college classmates at mas matagal pa üòä

4. At ang huli: Mas importante ang mental health mo kesa sa kahit anong trabaho. Kung di mapakawalan ang toxic na trabaho agad agad para sa pamilya o para sa pera, magtiis muna then gumawa ng game plan para makaalis sa mga p_nyet~ na yan. Pero remember MENTAL HEALTH is also WEALTH! Wala tayong paggagamitan ng pera kung patay na o nagbabalak na magpakamatay. 2024 na, open na lahat about sa Mental Health. Kung meron di pa, we can educate them. Kapag naooverwhelm ka na at kailangan mo ng kausap, go to the Philippines Mental Health Association Facebook page. May makakausap ka dun.

* Lying by omission (management mentioned that we will be receiving performance bonuses last year, but until now wala pa rin + many of my teammates have asked follow-ups but we didn't hear jackshit)
* Favoritism (CEO cherrypicks the best performers and shames the underperforming + roasts people for their mistakes over and over again until it gets dehumanizing)
* Blatant ignorance and rejection of feedback to the management raised by teams in terms of bettering workplace conditions
* Little-to-no potential for career growth
* Understaffed

Pero bago niya ako ihold sa clearance, nasabi po sakin ng hr department na clear na po ako sa audit department at hindi daw po nila alam bakit ako hinold ng admin sa dati kong work. I don't know kung may laban po ako dito or kung makukuha ko pa po ang clearance ko. Kahit wala ng last pay pero kailangan ko po kasi talaga ng clearance at hindi po nila ako binibigyan ng maayos na sagot sa kung anong susunod kong gagawin para maayos ang clearance ko.

Sana po may makatulong at may laban po ba ako kung sakaling mareport ko po ito sa dole?

2024-04-04 07:42:07,Text-only,"Received a job offer from state-owned bank, but for a different position than the one I applied for","I recently took an assessment exam and an initial interview for a government-owned bank. There were five of us in the exam room, and we ended up getting to know each other and becoming Facebook friends. Today, I received my exam results and found out that I passed, but unfortunately, the other four didn't. Later, HR contacted me and offered me a position in the HR division. However, it was a contract job that didn't meet my salary expectations, and it wasn't the position I had initially applied for. I declined the offer because I didn't want a temporary job with uncertain job security or tenure, and the job description wasn't aligned with my career goals. The HR person said that they would put me in the pool of qualified candidates for future job vacancies. So mag-lutang lutang lang rin application ko. 

Applying for government jobs can be frustrating talaga and draining ‚Äòno, and I wish the system catered more to the applicants who are genuinely interested in the job. I hope that they‚Äôll contact me for a permanent position in the future.

Pero since good company nga, ang hirap makapasok. Grabe hiring process nila sobrang higpit, paper screening palang pwede ka na maligwak. 

My previous boss in Company B had the chance to get in Company A. 

I grabbed the opportunity to reach out if may vacancy sa team niya from a Product/Program role (which is my background for 4 1/2 years now). Luckily, meron daw so I submitted my resume and started the interview process. 

Again, swerte. I got JO not just with Company A but with another option, Company C. 

Weighted pros and cons, Company A won. 

I signed.... Happy ending? WRONG. 

i felt that my teammates are very secretive with the Program I'll be handling, I kept asking for a proper turnover but they kept sharing very high level information and ako pa nakipagkilala sa mga stakeholders for a walkthrough of what they do for the program I'm hired to handle. 

The reason behind the secretive tactic pala is yung MVP (Fresh grad na may opportunity to go to multiple units) decided to stay sa unit namin and handle my Program. 

Okay lang naman sakin pero nawalan ako ng trabaho, I became redundant. 

I raised this as a concern but the resolution was to give a role of Sales, which is not my background at all. however, may person in charge nadin for Sales. 

I was tasked to assist my existing teammates on their tasks. 

I became an assistant. (I'm of rank, currently, manager rank) so ang hirap tanggapin. 

Gathered the strength to tell HR. 

Tanong: Tama ba ginawa ko na sinabi ko kay HR yung nagffeel kahit yung prev boss ko na naging boss ko uli na nagpasok sakin sa company?

Im currently routing my clearance with my previous organization, and my boss wont sign my clearance due to ""missing"" files with my handover.

I ended with them last March, and had a meeting with another colleague for my handover documents. I wasn't made aware of any missing files when I had my handover meeting (which was a week before and then on my last 2 days as well). I did also reach out to my manager a week before my end date for the handover but she never responded to my messages. 

When I first routed my clearance, she noted that I should return the laptop ASAP and they will be checking my handover files. 

I returned the assets a week after my end date, but I was not flagged with any missing files or documents when I dropped by the office. 

I got her on cc on every email for the handover, and as requested by my colleague, I uploaded the files needed via our sharepoint as well and made an email about every task I had and the tasks that they need to do or continue.

There is also recording of the handover meeting as requested by my colleague so that she can back track everything.

When I dropped by the office to return the assets, to my surprise there were questions being asked to me by my colleague which was already discussed thoroughly during our handover meeting and it was also included in the email. 

Now I put my boss as my reference, since she is my line manager however the organization withdrew their job offer after receiving the reference letter from my former manager. 

I left the organization in a peaceful manner, no issues or whatsoever. ",1,6,0.67,Advice Needed ü§î,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/1bumxzr/my_boss_wont_sign_my_clearance_and_i_lost_a/,1bumxzr

It upsets me that she pushes her body to the limit that she frequently gets sick because of the toxic work environment that she has been dealing with for the past year. She also mentioned about the high resignation rates and job positions that are constantly open in her company which is automatically a red flag. 

When I searched about the overtime pay in the Philippines, according to Article 87 of the Labor Code: any employee shall be paid for overtime work at a rate not less than their regular wage plus at least 25%. For work done beyond eight hours on holidays and rest days, the rate is even higher‚Äîno less than the regular wage plus at least 30%. 

But it also stated that there are exceptions to this like managerial employees and certain types of field personnel which could be a loophole the company could be using. Are junior accountants not eligible for overtime pay?

2024-04-02 17:56:55,Text-only,I AM A MEAT VENDOR IN DIVISORIA AND MY EMPLOYEE(BUTCHER) FILED A COMPLAINT TO DOLE AND NLRC,"Baka pwede pong humingi ng tulong.

Ang scenario po ay..

* Siya po ay butcher na kasama sa pagtitinda, pero yung mga gamit po namin panglatag sa Divisoria tulad ng gantyo, timbangan atbp ay nakalagay po noon sa tricycle na dinadrive din niya papunta sa puwesto o yung workplace nila sa night market. Pero para gumaan din yung trabaho nila, bumili po kami ng multicab para mayroon silang sasakyan na dadalhin sa Divisoria at para doon na lang nakalagay lahat ng gamit kapag tapos magtinda at hindi na ipapasok pa sa bahay.
* Nagulat po kami ng biglang nagreklamo siya sa Bitag na hindi raw namin siya pinapasahod ng 3 years na sa pagdadrive dahil noong 2020 raw ay bukod daw ang sahod sa pagdadrive niya at pagiging butcher niya. Hindi po namin alam na may problema pala sa kaniya ang pagdadrive at nalaman lang po namin yan nung tumawag yung staff ng Bitag.
* 700 pesos a day ang sahod po niya. Nakukuha niya po ito pagkatapos namin magtinda araw-araw. 10:30 pm hanggang 4:00 am ang paglatag sa Divisoria pero mga 7:00 am na sila natatapos. Ang sahod niya po ay walang kaltas sa SSS, Philhealth, at Pag-IBIG. Wala po kaming company ID dahil small business lang. Walang payslip; pagtapos magtinda receive agad ng pera.
* After tumawag ng Bitag, ilang days palang ay nagpaere siya at sinabi niya yung reklamo niya sa pagdadrive. Without my consent, inere nila yung picture ko at yung picture ng meatshop namin sa baba ng bahay namin (na hindi naman niya pinagtatrabahuhan dahil sa Divisoria na pwesto namin siya nagtatrabaho). Ang permit po namin sa Divisoria ay nakapangalan sa kapatid ko dahil siya na po ang nagmamanage doon at ako po ang nagfifinance. Sa meatshop naman po namin sa baba ng bahay ay asawa ko po ang owner.
* Nirefer po siya sa DOLE tas nagpadala ng notice of conference. Nakaaddress po sa meatshop namin sa bahay ang letter, at nakalagay doon na iniimbita ay management ng meatshop namin. Dumalo kami at ang nakalagay po na reklamo ay walang 13th month pay, walang Service Incentive Leave, at wala raw pong benefits. Naset aside yung initial niyang reklamo na dapat naming bayaran siya sa pagdadrive ng bukod, dahil ang narereceive niya raw dati ay meron pang additional na 500 pesos sa pagdadrive. Ang niraise niya rin pong concern is ginigipit din siya sa pagbabale, na ayon sa batas hindi naman namin pala obligasyon.
* After ng paguusap, inaask niya kami ng 150,000 for settlement. Nagoffer kami ng 70,000 tas kakaltasan ng 20,000 (balance niya sa pagbabale) bale malinis na 50,000 ang makukuha niya. Humingi po kami ng tulong sa abogado, sa totoo lang daw po generous amount na ang 50,000 para sa ganitong case. Ang bigat po ng 150,000 para sa amin dahil vendor lang naman po kami. Ayaw niya po pumayag dahil gusto niya 150k at nirefer na po kami sa NLRC.
* Klaro po samin na gusto niya ng pera, dahil ganyan po ang ginawa ng kapatid niya sa company nila at nakareceive ng 200,000. Ma'am/Sir, hindi po kami kumpanya..vendor lang po kami.

Questions:

1. Paano po ba namin siya pagbabayarin sa ginawa niyang kahihiyan sa amin through media kung saan wala naman pong katotohanan ang mga sinabi niya?
2. Posible bang madismiss ang complaint/case na ifafile niya sa NLRC? Ano po ba ang basis nila sa pagaaccept ng mga reklamo?
3. Ano pong masasabi niyo 150,000 na asking amount niya for settlement? (Ang hirap lang po kasi parang naeextort kami kasi uuwi pala siya ng probinsiya pagkatapos makareceive ng pera at gusto raw nila magsimula doon)
4. Magkano po kaya ang aabutin na babayaran ko sa kasong ito?
5. Paano po namin mapapatunayan na sa Divisoria siya nagtatrabaho at hindi sa meatshop namin? Kapag po ba parehas ng owner pupuwede pong iaddress niya sa meatshop ang reklamo? (Katwiran niya, sa meatshop daw namin nanggagaling ang baboy)
6. Gaano po katagal namin marereceive ang summon from NLRC?

2024-03-31 23:22:20,Text-only,Pagod na akong mag-benta ng product na wala pa namang bumibili,"Gusto ko lang mag-release ng saloobin ko at manghingi ng advice dito. Medyo mahaba to, so maraming salamat sa mga makikinig sakin dito.

Background ko is, fresh graduate, with no prior experience to sales and business to business relation.

And right now, I'm handling a product for a year already with ZERO Sales. I am the second person to handle this product, and ever since this product was acquired by our company, it has never got any closed deal or income for the company.

Imagine? Ganon na katagal.

And to give you more insight sa sitwasyon ko, hindi rin siya yung type ng product na super necessity sa isang industry. It was just an upgrade for an existing market.

Sobrang nappressure na ko, since some of the consumables of the equipment I'm selling will be soon expiring in the middle of this year, pati na rin yung license to sell it dito sa Pinas.

Don't get me wrong, marami na kong ginawa sa part ko para mebenta to:

-joining tradeshows/exhibits

-cold calling (lead generation)

-offering it with zero down payment, with 12 months installment package

-tinanong ko na rin ang boss ko kung pupwede ba na directly akong magpunta sa companies so I can meet my clients personally, since when i pitch the lead to our salespeople who have a car, they don't prioritize it kasi nga alam nila na wala pang nabebentang ganito, and hindi siya super necessity.

Kaso my boss didn't allowed me to do so since I don't have a car yet, and for me to establish a relationship, he said I need to visit them constantly, therefore it would mean that I would commute alone to every entity that I have a lead, which is very tiring and costly on my part

-nagawa ko na rin mag conduct ng effective and strategic product presentations and demos, na may comparative slides with clients current set up using other alternatives, and how they're better when they acquire our machine.

Yet after presenting it to the client, the usual  responses would be:

\\- Hindi pa namin siya priority

\\- ""we actually don't need it, since we are currently using this ""alternative"".

\\- Wala pa kaming budget diyan, may iba pa kaming priority

\\- maybe we will try to pitch it to our bosses next year for purchase

\\- our business would still function without your equipment on it, therefore it isn't really a necessity.

\\- And some would also think that ""I am just selling a useless product"".

Sobrang degrading sa pakiramdam bilang isang professional na habang nagppresent ako sa clients, makikita ko na pinagtatawanan ako ng mga customers ko, nagbubulungan, mostly sinasabi is ""hindi naman gaano ka-essential yung product niya"".

Ang sakit honestly. Na ginawa ko lahat ng makakaya ko para aralin yung machine at galingan during product presentation, tapos pagbubulungan lang at pagtatawanan habang nagpproduct presentation. Iniisip ko baka may mali na ko habang nagppresent.

Alam niyo yung tingin ng audience na, ""sinusubukan lang ako nito bentahan ng hindi pa naman ganun ka importanteng makina.""

Also, my target market were so busy, and they medyo mahirap din sila makausap kasi nasa restricted area sila.

May mga inaabutan din ang salespeople namin ng brochure ng product na handle ko, and then binabalik lang sa kanila, sinasabi na, hindi naman namin to kailangan. :(

To be honest, I feel so frustrated and hopeless about it. It feels like I am pouring in a broken cup. Nauubos lang lahat ng pagod at effort ko para sa wala.

This is my first experience of working in this industry, and at hindi ko na alam ang gagawin ko sa product ko na hindi maibenta-benta.

Konti na lang, magreresign na ko sa sobrang pressure ko. At sobrang sakit sa dibdib. May mga pagkakataon pa na after presentation, gusto ko na umiyak kasi pakiramdam ko, hindi sila ganun ka-interesado sa pinepresent ko.

Alam niyo yung pakiramdam na excited ka mag-kwento tapos yung kausap mo, tinatawanan ka lang, and seems uninterested? Ganon. Ang hirap, tang-ina. How I wish nasa fast moving goods ako naka-assign.

Ang sakit din na tuwing nakikita kami ng boss ko or nakakasama ako during meeting with sales, lagi niya nabbring up na ""failure"" ako pagdating sa pagbebenta nitong product na to.

Hiyang-hiya na rin ako sa colleagues at lalo na sa boss ko. Kasi yung zero sales na to, it reflects who I am eh. I take full responsibility of the situation naman, to the point na pakiramdam ko minsan parang wala na kong ginagawang tama.

Pagod na ko sa paulit ulit na makakakuha ng lead, kokontakin, magseset ng schedule, magppresent, then tatawanan lang habang nagppresent/pagbubulungan lang ako, tapos after presentation sasabihin, ""ay sorry di pa kasi namin siya priority ngayon"".

Iniisip ko baka kulang lang ako sa strategy or proper sales training and handling negotiation. Pati kung paano mag add ng urgency sa presentation.

Gustuhin ko man mag-resign, ayoko naman mag-mukhang failure na iwanan na lang ang boss ko at ang company na wala man lang silang napala sa lahat ng ininvest nilang training at pasahod sakin. Kaya hanggat kaya ko pa, gagawa ako ng paraan para lang maka-close kahit isang deal nito. Ipit na ipit ako sa nararamdaman ko sa totoo lang.

Pagod na ko pero ayoko sukuan kasi nakakahiya naman sakanila at ayoko rin umalis na failure sa company, dahil hindi naman ako quitter.

Sobrang nahihirapan ako mag-benta. Kaya sana maging mabait naman kayo sa mga tinatawag niyong ""ahente lang"". Pinag-aaralan, pinagpupuyatan, at pinagpapaguran po namin tong mga product na pinepresent namin. May mga pamilya rin po kaming binubuhay kaya sana irespeto niyo kami kapag nagppresent.

Hindi po lahat ng ahente, gusto lang makabenta tapos iiwan na kayo sa ere pag after sales na. Yung iba, willing talaga kayong tulungan sa current problem niyo at ready to assist hanggang after sales.

Salamat kung umabot kayo dito. Gusto lang mag-release ng frustrations ko sa work ko. Kasi di ko na talaga alam kung sinong pagsasabihan ko nito. Ipit na ko sa pressure ng boss ko, at pressure na wala pang nabebenta.



And if may ma-aadvice kayo sa sitwasyon ko, salamat rin, sobrang maaappreciate ko talaga. :(

Hi I‚Äôm 24F and I need some help and a different perspective on what I would tell my current employer, who I‚Äôm on probation right now, that I plan on leaving. Don‚Äôt get me wrong they‚Äôre a great company, it‚Äôs a small growing company, the work environment is good and I‚Äôm learning a lot everyday however the pay is low and the travel going there can take me from 2-3 hours depending on the traffic, since I‚Äôm from QC and my workplace is in Makati. The other company on the other hand is a big company and travel can take up to 1 hour and 30 mins only and the pay is bigger. This time though I would have a different role which I am interested in too. The problem is, the new company that wants to hire me wants me to start before my probation period ends in my current company and I clearly stated that I‚Äôll only be available after the end of my probation with my current employer. I honestly wanna grab this opportunity with this new company because I don‚Äôt think any other company offers this type of role in Metro Manila or PH in general. But ayun I think they kind of disrespected my expected starting date. I emailed them about it na and they gave me a new starting date which is still before my expected starting date. So I‚Äôm really torn on what I should do :(

2024-03-30 20:52:31,Text-only,Advice needed ,"Hi there, as the title suggest. I'm(25M) (Mechanical Engineer) thinking of leaving my company. My current job is a Data Center engineer in an IT company here in the South but my family is out north. After working here for a year and a half, I feel like I should quit in order to earn more money. I think there's a lot that I'm losing out on. Many reports here on reddit suggest that people switch jobs during this period of time and have a chunk of salary increase . Salary wise, this company compensates me more than 20k with 13th month pay and even a bonus that can give you a range of 2x-3x your current salary and also it increases every year around 10-12%. This company also gives Internal training but it comes with a price of bonds but the duration is very short. My Bond should finish this August but they're planning on making us get the ITIL exam this December. Why do I think of leaving this company, after all this benefits? here's why? feel like I can do more with my achievements right now. I just recently got my 2nd PRC license. this February. We also have Internal Training here and recently got an CDCP certificate last year. I'm planning on getting a CCNA Certificate this year. I'm super grateful for my Manager and the culture here, but we can't have it all. Can we? the Lead on our team can't even teach us about a thing or two. We just need to atleast figure it out on our own. No guidance and whatsoever. Whenever I ask a question, he would just shut me up and won't even answer. I can still remember when it was still my probation period . He would sometimes ask questions about the fundamentals and I couldn't answer the right question everytime, I mean it's been months since I last reviewed. He would say out loud are u really an engineer? feeling ko ang bobo ko dito sa part eh. Man that hurted alot and even now. I think this is one of my main reason I think I'm stagnating because I feel like I'm not learning well. I also think that even having all of this achievements acquired. I think that I will never be good enough. All of my co workers here are smart and have technical skills and have different backgrounds rather than me having zero experience prior coming here.

2024-03-30 13:17:50,Text-only,Time to Resign üôå,"Time to Resign üôå (Repost ko nalang para don sa nag reklamo na dalawa) Haha

So currently I am working on a big company here in Ph (MM) . I am working with them for almost 1 year na this coming April. 

First, I work with them as a Graphic Artist pero Multimedia Artist yung JT ko. So Nag start
ako with them yr 2023. Nag final interview ako
with the RM and yung dating MA nila which sya magging immediate head ko. Onsite ako ni-last interview so nakita ko yung office maganda, maayos madaming employee. So shempre napa wow din ako and since final interview na yon next is yung offer and I accepted it na. Habang iniinterview ako numg RM and yung IH ko, mejo blinded ako that time na something wrong with my IH. Siguro sa sobrang overwhelmed ko na pumasok sa magandang company, mejo ok na sahod hndi ko napansin yon. I just ignored it, until my first day. 

On my first day shempre diretso ako sa HR non, pirma time ng contract, discussion ng benefits etc etc. So After that may pinasagutan sakin before ako pumunta sa area ko and yung IH ko sinundo ako. When she came, no ‚ÄúHI HOW are you!, Im ~~ and ako yung maggng head mo :)‚Äù But she just entered the room and sit and asked me ‚ÄúTapos kana?‚Äù and since i am blinded sakania  na may something sakania inignore ko lang. So tapos nako mag sagot dun sa pinapasagutan  so nag sabi ako sa HR and submitted the paper. Yung IH ko nag ccp lang sya while I‚Äôm answering yung pinapasagutan nila. As in CP no talk, no conversation. Then she asked me again ‚ÄúTapos kana?‚Äù and I said ‚ÄúYes po‚Äù. So tumayo sya, tumayo na din ako and I remembered what she said ‚ÄúIkaw na mag dala ng laptop mo, mabigat yan eh‚Äù. Like where‚Äôs the warm welcome there? Hahahah. Not saying na sya dapat mag dala kasi willing naman ako mejo nakaka OFF lang yung attitude. 

And the days past by nakikita ko na hindi nya ko gusto as her subordinate. So ayon hanggang sa 3rd, 4th month ko up to now nasanay na kami na mag uusap lamg pag may task nako. May time na buong 8Hrs hndi kami nag uusap, pag dating nya sa office uupo lang sya no kamustahan, no goodmorning. May times dati magchachat pa sya to the fact na magkatabi lang kami. Kaya simula non na ilang nako. May times din na naka earphones ako since working hours no talks talaga naka silent mode as in so shempr kinig nalang ako spotify ng mga podcast. Eh tinatawag nya pala ko or may need sya, for my opinion kasi MAGKATABI lang kami ano ba naman yung kalabitin or tap nya lang ako sa balikat dba or chat nalang ako sa viber kung may sasabhn sya well TINAP nya ng sobrang lakas yung table side ko which is nagulat ako and since open area kami mej napahiya ako ng beri beri layt. 

Then yun after non may scenarios naman na binabara nya ko like nung kausap ko yung isang ka office mate namin and then may tinanong ako dun sa kausap ko about someone na ka office mate din namin basta ang pagkakatanda ko ang tinatanong ko is may sinasabi yung ka office mate ko na may isang taga ibang dept na ka same ko ng lugar kung saan nauwi eh since bago pako tinanong ko yung ka officemate ko if may idea ba sya if saan sa *lugar namin* yung sinasabi nya taga ibang dept, and sa hindi inaasahang pang yayari sumabat yung IH sabay sabi *‚ÄúKahit naman sabihin namin sayo dimo rin kilala‚Äù* LIKE SHOOKT. ü´¢ HHAHAHAHAHA 

After nyan ilang na talaga ako, tho may comm pa din kami pero work related nalang like pag may papagawa sya and about sa mga tasks ko like revisions etc. 

The main point is when I worked with my previous IH or ‚ÄúMentors‚Äù sobrang dami kong takeaways from them and mron kaming personal bonds as in close ko. Never akong naintimidate, never akong kinabahan makipag usap as on sobrang smooth ng transactions and comm. but not this one. Feel ko pumapasok nalang ako do the tasks and sahod but not doing the tasks while learning and earning. Some jobs na unrelated sa designing pinagawa rin sakin which is isa sa tasks nya before yun. May times din na inutuusan ako before maglakad ng permit sa isang place i dunno if part pa yun ng JD ko, may times din na pinadala sa office, sya yung contact person may gnagawa ako and ako pinakuha tinanong ko if bayad na pero dipa daw so nagdala ako since ilang ako and trusted ko naman na babayaran nag wait nalang ako and since IH ko sya nahiya naman ako manigil.

Ayun so currently I‚Äôm starting to applying na pero still employed pa rin since may mga bayarin hehe. ",0,2,0.33,Story üó£Ô∏è,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/1br9ye1/time_to_resign/,1br9ye1

Tbh, hindi naman toxic yung work, mabait mga workmates, and malapit lang din yung worksite sa house ko so 10-minute jeepney ride lang siya. Yun lang, mababa sahod (below 20k) and inaccept ko lang siya kasi first job ko siya. For experience lang sana.

We also have a carenderia na medyo matagal na (20+ years, yes older than me. Baby ‚Äòyan ni mommy dati, mas mahal niya pa kesa sa akin charot) and that‚Äôs earning pretty well. Sales are averaging around 60-70k per month, net sales na. Our staff is trust-worthy, and they work well on their own. Hindi ko na need everyday bumisita sa pwesto, kasi nagkukusa na silang maghatid ng sales and inventory sa akin kasi alam nilang may work ako. I‚Äôd say we built a pretty good relationship with the staff as well.

Wala naman akong family na binubuhay‚Äî only my dad now, na pensionado na rin naman. He worked abroad his whole life too, kaya may savings siya for himself.

I‚Äôm thinking of resigning, kasi I don‚Äôt see the point, at least for now, of me working when may business naman. Pero naisip ko lang din yung possibility of the business going bankrupt (sana hindi naman) and everything else that might happen in the future. Plus yung HMO and benefits ko pa, sayang din.

Nasasayangan din ako kasi maluwag yung sa trabaho ko ngayon, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be able to find a job with a similar set-up in the future. But then again, yung sahod ko naman for a month is equivalent to just a week‚Äôs sale ng tindahan namin. So idk.

Ito lang yung halos laman ng contract:

1. Monthly compensation
2. Schedule ng sahod
3. Start date
4. Clause ""Your employment with \*company name\* is ""at will"", which means the company may terminate our employment relationship at any time, with or without cause or advance notice."".
5. Isa pang clause ""Accepting this agreement creates a binding contract between you and the \*company name\*. You are also bound by the \*company name\* policies, rules, and regulations as set by the company and other similar policies."".
6. 5 months probationary.

Full time job yung inaplayan ko sa kanila tapos nasa job description din na full time role ito at regular employment. Mas mababa yung offer nila compared sa previous employer ko. Wala din akong copy ng company policies, rules, and regulations nila.

Eto naman yung mga wala sa contract namin:

1. Govt mandated benefits
2. HMO
3. Rendering period
4. Work setup and work schedule (day shift daw to and fully remote sabi sakin sa interview)
5. Company devices na ipapagamit sakin. So I expect na sariling laptop/pc gagamitin ko.
6. Allowances
7. OT Pay
8. SL and VL

18k lang yung offer. I also found out na wala sila sa list ng sec registered companies dito sa PH. Fresh grad lang ako pero grabe naman ata yung gantong offer. üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",15,23,1.0,Rant üò°,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/1bougy6/disappointed_sa_jocontract/,1bougy6

Damay mo pa yung Manager ng kabilang department na gusto laging urgent kahit kulang na kulang kami sa manpower at mahilig mag pasa ng trabaho.

Tinitiis ko na lang din dito kahit mababa sahod dahil mabait yung manager ko, at yung mga taong nasa baba ko, madami akong natututunan sa kanila sa totoo lang.

Naopen up ko to sa Manager ko at binigyan naman ako ng basbas para makipag-sagutan, pero paminsan hindi ko na kase matiis, gusto ko na makipag sigawan. Nahihiya lang ako makipag sagutan kase baka sabihin ""bago ka pa lang dito"" pero nakaka puno na din kasi.

2024-03-27 08:24:45,Text-only,"Nakakainis yung mga ""leaders"" sa team namin","Di kasi ako makamove on talaga on how my colleagues acted today. We have this monthly business review kasi, and isa ako sa main person na magconduct non. So, every area may mga in charge to prepare and discuss their PPTs. And every one is compliant naman despite the super busy sched we have the past few weeks. Those identified owners really put an effort in making their slides and sending it to me on time. Except sa supervisors namin.

What happened, yung unang sched namin (which is last week) ay pinamove nila (supervisors) kasi di pa sila nakakapag-update ng slides, and nagreason sila na imove namin pagbalik nung isa naming kawork (the one who usually conducts it) kasi last business review nya na with us dahil lilipat na ng ibang team. So I consider the request, and move the review today.

So today, I reminded the owners to update their slides para okay na lahat later sa review. And then yung supervisors namin nagdemand na naman sakin na imove ulit, and nagreason out na naman sila ng kung ano ano, well in fact di lang naman talaga nila naupdate yung slides nila. Kaya ako, pinilit ko talaga na wag mamove kasi nakakahiya naman sa mga nagpasa on time, kasi parang di nirerespeto yung time nila. What annoys me is sumagot pa yung isa and sinabi na ""Kaya naman yan ng quarterly!"" In which I replied, ""Bat pa natin ginawang monthly to kung quarterly pala gusto nyo."" And to be honest, mas kawawa yung owners na affected if quarterly ang gagawin kasi their reports are more crucial kesa dun sa hinihintay na report from those supervisors, and di madali magcollate ng data for 3 mos at gawan ng comparison yun.

Niraise ko sa manager namin na okay na lahat, yung slide nalang ng 2 supervisor and kulang, and yun nalang hinihintay. And yet, ang action ng boss ko is to cancel the meeting, kasi kung ano ano na din yung nireason out sa kanya nung 2. Wala na kong nagawa. Eh may invited kaming manager mula sa ibang team, and even her nagulat sya na nacancel yung review today, and yet ang reason ng Manager ko ""madami kasing training"". Gusto kong sabihin na ""wala po kasing slides pa until now yung mga supervisor namin"". Sobrang inis ko, di nalang ako kumibo na, nasira na yung mood ko.

Yung mga involve persons na magpepresent sana, nagsipag-rant sakin na bakit daw na-cancel, lagi nalang daw ganon kaya nasasanay yung 2 supervisor na di mag-update ng part nila kasi laging pinagbibigyan. I understand where they are coming and I symphatize with them. I tried to defend them, kaso wala eh. And now, I'm so mad kasi napaka-unfair talaga. 

Plus factor pa na ako yung tao na gusto naka-plan ng maayos yung mga bagay, and pag naset ko na yung utak ko dun sa plinano ko and biglang naiba or di natuloy, nahihirapan na ko magfunction effectively, kasi nasisira talaga mood ko.

2024-03-27 00:09:16,Text-only,Contract vs Labor Code,"For context, I was hired last year as a senior web developer, things are actually pretty good with this company other than the contract and schedule arrangements.  


So last year nung 2 months palang ako sa company, my employer sent me an email notifying me that the contract was amended so that developers are only paid with a fixed amount, essentially removing holiday premium pay, night differential pay, and RDOT pay, in exchange for what they call ""flexible time"".  
The first few months with the new contract was actually fine lang kase the normal work schedule ng development team namin is around 3pm to 11pm, and we are seldom asked to stay late lang talaga, and if ever we have to stay late, we can offset a few hours of work for the next day. So we thought di masyadong big deal yung contract...

However, pagkadating ng around late november, dun na kami nagka issue sa contract... Kase medyo cramming na kami sa deadlines on phase 1 completion ng project. So basically, dun ko napansin na inaabuso na ng management ang contract arrangements namin. We are asked to work na starting 8pm to 4am every day. Which I think is the first breach nila sa contract arrangement without night differential pay... Then come the holidays, sinagad talaga yung workhours namin, minsan kahit sa weekends and some non-working-holidays pinapa work parin kami para lang daw makuha yung deadline, pero ang masaklap walang RDOT pay, at holiday premiums... There were also like 3 weeks sa early 2024 na pinapunta kami sa office every day, and palagi overtime pa, para lang daw makaabot sa deadline. Though nilibre naman nila lunch namin that time, pero I think di parin justified yung hours na tinatrabaho namin para lang dun... Then early february, sinabihan na talaga kami na graveyard schedule (10pm to 6am) na daw kami until further notice until now...   


Palagi ko binabanggit sa team leads meeting namin with HR yung issue about sa contract at kung pano inaabuso ng management (CTO) namin ang contract... Pero parang wala parin movement sa HR ehh.. Since January ko pa ni re-raise yung concern ko about the missing benefits as per Labor Code, pero wala talaga movement ehh kase parang sunod-sunoran lang din si HR ng CTO and CEO na Americans...   


Ano ba pwede ko gawin as manggagawa? :( Burn out na ako sa kaka trabaho ng gabi, holiday, and sometimes weekends, tapos kulang pa yung binabayad...  


Ngayong holy week sa 28 and 29, tinanong ko kung ano arrangements namin sa work, sabi work parin daw kami 10pm to 6am, tapos offset nalang daw sa following weeks ng di sabay sa ibang team members.. Ni raise ko yung concern na dapat yung holiday offset is equivalent sa 4 days na no work kase supposedly double pay yan ehh... Kaso, nireject yung proposal ko, kase dapat 2 days lang parin and offset na mga araw... Sarap mang away ng CTO talaga.. :(

&#x200B;

Pero ano ba choice ko? pinapasweldohan lang naman ako.. :( Irereport ko na talaga sila sa DOLE.. :( Pero gusto ko lang malaman kung nasa tama ba ako, or kung ano recommendations nyo sakin..

I work in a supervisory position as part of the operations. Sa nature ng work, hindi pwedeng walang kapalitan or mabakante. I already understand that ""just work within your time"" and all but that's not the issue.

Sa scheduling namin, usually may overlap ang duty - around 1.5hrs. But due to issues beyond my paygrade, saktuhan na ang oras - like if you end ng 5pm, the next starts at 5pm. Kaso nagkaroon ng culture ng matuusin ang mga tao rito ang eventually even yung mga supervisor and managers are doing the same, Honda sa pasok kasi may unpaid overtime daw since nageextend daw sila after ng duty hours nila. Then, comes the IRR of the service charge law recently release last Feb na apektuhan ang service charge ng mga employee. Lalo na naging matuusin sila sa oras.

So ano yung rant? Remember na nasabi ko bakit always need may tao sa shift? It is because of the turn over ng duties. We do have a log book but hindi lahat pinagpala sa gramming at reading comprehension at need ito isuppliment ng verbal. Pero meron silang olympics kung sino ang pinaka dikit sa bago malate pagdating sa biometrics. Like, yeah, hindi ka nga late pero paalis na ako. What's worse? Pag di naintindihan yung turnover, tatawagan ka pa after office hours. Magagalit pa yan pag di maayos yung turnover kaya mapipilitan ka din magextend hanggang maintindihan yung gusto mong sabihin kahit full effort na plain as day na naipasa sa kanila yung turnover.

IMO, I'm not requesting them to come in very early before the time but at least give a damn to come in at most 5mins before the time. At least may condensed version na ng turnover ang maibigay sa inyo. It is the respect towards sa oras ng ibang tao, hindi kunpanya.

Pero nasagad ako, na halos lahat ng sinasabi niya sakin (na masasakit na salita for me), yun nadin yung nagiging tingin ko sa sarili ko. Tas dumating din ako sa point na tuwing tatawag siya kinakabahan ako kasi baka may mali nanaman akong nagawa. Tas every morning, bago pumasok sa work naiyak ako kasi makikita or makakausap ko nanaman siya.

I'm a Junior Interior Designer. Nag-wowork ako for a Architecture + Interior Design Firm. However, ang Architecture Team namin is composed of 5 people (2 seniors and 3 regular employees) plus 3 OJTs. Sa Interior Design Team, 2 lang kami doon (1 senior and me na regular lang). Obviously, sobrang lamang ang Architecture Team namin at sobrang lugi kami sa Interior Design Team. 

Yung Senior Interior Designer namin, parating wala and late pumapasok ng office kaya lahat ng trabaho niya binibigay niya sa akin. Nagpapatong-patong na mga gawain ko na nasisira na time management ko. Ako na sumasalo ng work niya pero ang pay ko ay hindi pang-senior. Lately, nagtanong HR namin sa Senior Interior Designer namin kung nahihirapan na ba ako sa mga workload ko. Sabi ng Senior Interior Designer, ichecheck niya raw. Kaya nagtatanong HR namin kasi balak niya mag-hire pa ng isang Junior Interior Designer

So nagtanong nasa akin Senior ko kung nabubulunan na ba ako sa workload ko. Sumagot ako na nahihirapan na ako kasi sabay-sabay ang demands sa akin tas ang dami rin pasingit na work kasi sinasalo ko na work ng Senior ko. Hindi ako pinakinggan ng Senior ko at sinabi niya sa akin na ""Kaya mo yan. Dapat masanay ka na"". Sumabat pa yung isang Senior from Archi Team at sinabi sa akin na ""Dapat mag-step up ka na. Sa totoo lang, di ka naman talaga nahihirapan. Nabibigla ka lang sa mga nangyayari"". Magsasalita pa ako kung ano pa nararamdaman ko kaso cinut-off ako ng Senior ko na parang pinapalit niya ang topic. 

Nakakainis lang na nagtatanong pa sila sa akin kung okay pa ako pero di naman ako papakinggan. Ginaslight pa nila ako. Kaya ang ending, hindi na mag-hihire HR namin ng isa pang Junior Interior Designer kasi mas pinakinggan nila yung Senior ko na parating wala at di naman ako binabantayan.

We didnt know na unregistered sila at nagtatago sa BIR until a week into the job. Kaya pala halos 4 kaming sabay na bago kasi puro nagreresign tao nila.

I want to report all their wrong doings, but IDK how and where to start. Lalo na at a friend who previously worked there told us na malakas sila sa DOLE at BIR dahil tinutulungan ng kaanak na lawyers. 

Here are their violations (that we know):

‚Ä¢ Unregistered E-commerce Business. Expired license (pinatago kami once, dahil may inspection pala at dapat 1-2 employees lang makita)

‚Ä¢ Hacked one of our FB accounts days after resigning, then proceeded to harass and fire 5 employee dahil sa nabasa sa gc nila

‚Ä¢ They illegally purchase and consume 100+ sims daily

‚Ä¢ Force us to use our own ID to make bank accounts na sila ang gumagamit (ranging from 3-5 banks each nagawa namin na nakapangalan samin/fam namin pero sila gumagamit)

‚Ä¢ Our tasks includes creating dummy accounts for them daily

‚Ä¢ Sexual harassment by said boss to most of us. Ate Secretary - pwinersa halikan ilang beses (also happened to the maid). then dinala somewhere in disguise of work daw pero resort pala and nilalasing lang sya all throughout the ride. Then ilan saming mga babae hinahawakan sa tagiliran, balikat, aakbayan without our consent + despite us saying NO repeatedly 

‚Ä¢ Verbal and physical abuse sa kinakasama/mistress nyang BUNTIS. Sa harap pa namin + sa gc binubully ni boss. Then a few times umiimik si girl na may pasa pa raw sya at masakit katawan na (the office is inside their home, katabi ng bedroom nila kaya rinig namin pag sinasaktan o minumura ni boss)

‚Ä¢ Hired a minor girl na di nakatapos then pays her 350-400 pesos only (city rate dapat)

‚Ä¢ Forces us to drink during duty, ang di uminom/malasing di nya pauuwiin

‚Ä¢ Wont give our backpay

2024-03-21 12:52:06,Text-only,Struggling with the Transition from College to Work,"Hey fellow Redditors,

I'm 22M who recently graduated from college last January 2024, and I'm feeling an overwhelming sense of nostalgia for my college days. As an irregular student, I've always felt a bit out of sync with my batchmates. While they were already working, I found myself pressured to jump into the workforce as well. However, now that I'm a few months into my job, I can't help but think that maybe I needed some time to rest and recharge before diving into the professional world.

Currently, I'm caught in an existential crisis. On one hand, I feel the weight of societal expectations and the pressure to continue working. On the other hand, I yearn for the carefree days of college and wonder if I should take a break to regain my energy and find clarity.

Should I continue pushing myself through the pressure and fulfill my work obligations, or would it be wise to finish my current contract and take some time off to rest and reflect? I'm torn between these two options, and your input could be invaluable in helping me make an informed decision.

TL;DR: I recently graduated as an irregular student and feel pressured to start working immediately. However, I miss my college life and wonder if I should take a break to rest before continuing my professional journey. Seeking advice from those who have faced a similar dilemma.",1,3,0.6,Advice Needed ü§î,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/1bjykfw/struggling_with_the_transition_from_college_to/,1bjykfw

I applied sa isang company na base in Au pero meron dto sa ph. They invited me for an initial interview last march 13 and since nagka conflict ako on that day and time. I tried to reschedule the interview. So tinry ko yung link for scheduling na mag resched yung calendly ata yun pero may error message so I decided to email the recruiter na contact person ko so I emailed her and I asked her na mag re-reschedule ako for next week ‚Äî March 20 (same day, same time) and she responded with ‚Äú It‚Äôs fine, just use the same link for rescheduling.‚Äù I got confused kasi sinabi ko na sakania sa unang email ko na hndi nag wowork yung rescheduling link so I emailed her back and clarified if meant nya ba is yung link na inischedule nya before which is the google link, but sadly ‚ÄúNO RESPONSE‚Äù As the days pass, no email from her regarding my concern or if close or open pa yung position so I still assumed that my initial interview will be still on going. 

Mar 20 nag decide ako mag halfday because I‚Äôm still assuming na tuloy pa rin yung interview since wala pa naman akong natatanggap na email from the HR manager na hndi na tuloy. Gumising ako maaga, nag prepare and 15 mins before the interview nag email ako sa HR and tell her na nasa meeting room nako ng (google meet) and guess what nag email back sya ng ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have schedule with you today. I am sorry to inform you that the position has been ALREADY FILLED‚Äù

Like wt. Napaka unprofessional kasi yung tone ng email nya is parang wala syang alam na nag pa resched ako and she confirmed it. First time

2024-03-20 13:59:12,Text-only,Termination due to disease/illness,"2 yrs mahigit na ko sa company namin. Last year, around July, nadiagnose ako with cancer. Nung una, pinapayagan nila ko mag-WFH since sa support naman kami. 

Pero around last week ng July, pinapabalik na nila ko sa office. Sinabi ko sa kanila na hindi ko na kaya physically magcommute (office is sa Makati; bahay is Bulacan) so nagrequest ako na kung pwede magWFH muna ko hangga't kaya ko and while naghihintay sa chemo session schedule. Hindi sila pumayag kasi unfair daw sa ibang employees. Binigyan nila ko ng options: it's either magoffice na ko or magindefinite leave na ko. Ayoko pa sanang magleave since medyo kaya ko pa naman magwork kahit WFH sana pero wala akong choice kasi di ko naman kaya yung travel paoffice. So, August 1, I filed my indefinite leave. 

After 7 months, they contacted me again and asked me about my plans. Nakakailang sessions na rin ako sa chemotherapy pero hindi pa rin bumabalik sa dati yung katawan ko, dagdag pa yung mga complications every after session. So I told them na gusto ko na sana bumalik ng work because yung finances namin is hindi na okay pero currently, hindi pa possible. Tinanong nila ako about sa prognosis ko and wala pa rin talaga akong masabi sa ngayon kasi unpredictable pa rin yung condition ko. Sabi nung admin namin, they've been arranging the organizational chart daw and hindi nila alam kung saan ako ilalagay kasi floating daw yung position ko (which is I think is not true kasi hindi naman limited sa kung ilan lang yung pwede magkaroon ng job title na kagaya nung sakin sa company namin), so inask ulit nila ako kung ano daw sa tingin ko yung pwedeng gawin if hindi pa rin daw pala ako sure kung kailan ako makakabalik. 

Alam ko that time na they know na ang sagot pero gusto lang nila na sakin manggaling so I answered, ""Resignation"". Which is alam ko na pagkakamali kasi I could've answered ""terminate nyo nalang po ako"". 

If termination due to disease, may makukuha pang separation pay hindi po ba? Did they just got me into saying resignation para hindi na sila magbayad ng separation pay? May definite po ba sa law natin kung ilang months lang pwede nakaindefinite leave yung employee? Ano po kaya yung magandang gawin dito sa situation na ito? Thank you in advance po sa sasagot.

Until now kasi pag may nakikita akong post regarding sa file ng leave na titrigger pa din ako. I've been working in manila for almost 2 months pa lang and first time ko lang din sa corporate world magtrabaho so wala akong alam sa mga rights ko that time and wala akong pake coz nakafocus ako para kumita ng pera. So, one time nag file ako ng 2 days leave dahil birthday ng anak ko and gusto kong umuwi sa province namin dahil na hohomesick na rin ako. After ko magfile ng leave kinausap ako ng immediate supervisor ko na bakit daw ako mag li-leave ng 2 days. So nagpaliwanag ako and nabanggit ko din na 2 months na kong hindi nakakauwi sa amin and na hohomesick na din ako sa manila, since wala naman ako malapit na kamag-anak dito or kaibigan, then, I thought maiintindihan ako ng ""immediate supervisor"" ko kasi taga probinsya din siya, instead, sabi niya lang sakin ""ako nga ilang years na kong hindi umuuwi sa probinsya namin, hindi naman ako nag file ng leave"". So pinagpaubaya ko nalang yon. Hindi ako umuwi ng 1ST BIRTHDAY ng anak ko dahil sa sinabi niya. Instead na magalit ako e. Tinatak ko pa sa isip ko na siguro ang hina lang ng loob ko kaya ako nahohomesick at dapat maging gayahin ko siya kasi ina- idolized ko pa siya that time (after ilang days nakausap ko yung ka work ko na matagal na din sa company, binanggit niya sakin na kaya hindi umuuwi ng province si ""IS"" dahil kasama niya pala yung family niya dito sa Manila. But still, I let it pass nalang. Pero after 2 weeks, nung naaksidente father ko. Naka duty ako that time. Exactly 2:23 P.M tumawag sakin kapatid ko and wife ko na naaksidente yung father ko. So nagsabi agad ako sa ""immediate supervisor"" ko (rinig na rinig niya while umiiyak wife ko habang sinasabi niyang naaksidente father ko). But guess what? Ang sinabi sakin ni ""IS"" ""bakit? Ano bang mga ginawa mo ngayong araw? Ilista mo mga ginawa mo bago ka umalis!"" (With a pagalit tone pa siya). So, kahit kating kati ako umuwi e ginawa ko pa rin yung sinabi niya kasi akala ko dati may rights siyang ganunin ako. Then nung nakauwi na ko sa province, nagmadali ako pumunta sa hospital. Then kinuwento ko sa kapatid ko yung scenario at doon niya pinaliwagan lahat ng rights ko as a worker.  after a week nag decide ako magresign, kinausap pa ko ni ""IS"" na pag-isipan mabuti kasi hindi na daw ako makakakuha ng opportunity na kagaya ng offer nila, which is a minimum wage salary lang naman tapos hindi pa bayad yung OT pagka hindi ka umabot sa 1 hour and kung magpapatama ka naman para maka 1hour pupunahin ka maigi ni ""IS"". 

So to all workers jan. If your boss doesn't approve your filed leave. That company is not worth it. Always choose yourself and family, dahil kayang kaya ka palitan ng company na pinapasukan mo. Pero yung family, time and moment with them will stay forever with your heart. ",20,4,1.0,Rant üò°,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/1bhpwav/anong_mga_ginawa_mo_ngayong_araw/,1bhpwav

As the title itself says, I am asking for an advice to any of you here folks. Medyo mahaba to kaya bear with me. 

I started my job to this company in our city last June 09,2023. Btw, telco pala to. It was very nice to be in this company and campaign dahil chill lang tho I came from telco before which is prepaid then ngayon postpaid na. Okay yung management before, okay rin yung 2 TLs ko kasi the first was transferred to nesting and the latter, resigned due to personal reasons. We were transferred to another TL last Dec 4 and the dilemma starts here. 


Ang lala ng ugali ng TL nato and di mo maintindihan kung moody ba or masama lang talaga ugali niya. Ayaw nya ng late pero sya mismo late. Since kami yung na add sa team nya, sinasabi niya sa OM na bakit sila daw mag aadjust sa RD eh number 1 sila sa cluster and turns out, hindi sila number one and second to the last sila sa ranking. Anyways, this is irrelevant na. Going back, pag may supcall, super nakakairita sya na parang ang sarap niyang sakalin. Naiintindihan ko naman na kailangan mag de escalate pero ayaw na talaga ng customer and gusto niya ng supervisor pero ayaw niyang tanggapin at tatawagan daw si customer within the day tapos pag may dsat, ikaw pa sisisihin kesyo ganyan,ganto. Ang stressful sobra. 


Then December came, we transitioned from billing CSR to Sales na as per business needs ng employer namin. Dito, stress na stress na ako. Di ako nakakahit sa quota pero di rin naman ako na zero sa sales. Ang malala pa, pag di ka nakakahit sa quota, di ka allowed mag leave kahit deserve mo yan. As in, everyday pumapasok na lang ako para sa bills and may araw rin na nagkakasagutan kami ng TL na yan kasi sama pa ng ugali, siya pa ang reason bakit masisira araw mo.

Hi guys, Question lang? Is it possible na iterminate ako ng HR manager ko dahil daw buntis ako? I‚Äôm 2 months pregnant btw and I have a japanese boss na hindi marunong umintindi ng english he has a translator but that translator disclose information sa group ng HR‚Äôs namin dahil sila lang ang magkakacircle of friends. Anyway back to the topic I have a friend of mine sa office namin na translator din and guess what narinig nya last friday na pinaguusapan ng HR MANAGER ko at ng boss ko na japanese na iteterminate nga daw ako dahil buntis ako at wala pa benefits and under agency nga lang daw ako. Nung lumapit daw ung translator friend ko is HR MANAGER ko and nagsalita na ‚ÄúGusto kasi ni sir na iterminate si blah blah blah‚Äù sinangkalan nya ung boss ko na japanese at ito daw ang may kagustuhan na alisin ako to think na last friday ko lang din sinabi sa boss ko na japanese na preggy nga ako oras palang ang lumipas and yet ung boss ko na japanese is nagdecide agad na alisin ako ganun ba yorn!? Ang sabi daw ng boss ko na japanese is pagiisipan nya pa ung sinasabi ng HR MANAGER ko na aalisin ako. Anyway, till May nalang ung boss kona japanese and may papalit na new boss japanese ulit so si Translator number 1 na nagdidisclose sa mga close friends nya ng information is possible na mawala or if magstay pa is questionable na dahil wala naman na sya itatranslate pa dahil ung papalit na new boss is fluent na magenglish. I guess na sya ang papalit sakin kaya gusto nila ako tanggalin. And my Friend na Translator din is rendering nalang sya till mid of april dahil nagresign na sya. Mga ka-HR i need your opinion about this. And it is possible ba talaga? I forgot to mention nga pala na we are not close ng manager ko since gusto nya ako sumama sa circle of friends nila na mga HR pero masasama ugali at pinupulutan ang buhay ng iba. I do my job professionally of course transparent lang ako sakanila thats why gusto nya ako alisin na nakikita ko is hindi nya ako magawang tuta nya.",17,22,0.95,Advice Needed ü§î,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/1bgn7gg/termination_dahil_buntis/,1bgn7gg

But then I was diagnosed with Lupus (Same as Kris Aquino) which I know pang mayaman. I was admitted sa hospital for 40 days from December to Feb this year. Dami kasing tests na naconduct para madetermine yung sakit ko. Yun din ung reason why I'm physically weak since na decondition ung katawan ko dahil sa pagkakahiga sa ICU nang matagal. 

Now I'm under several medications and maintenance. I became depressed gusto ko magwork tho I don't think na I'm still fit to work pa since sa case ko maraming affected organs ang nadamay ng sakit (kidneys, blood, and ung heart rate ko is tumaas. Not to mention yung physical state ko as of the moment. Laki ng pinayat. There are times na sobrang lutang ako due to medication or baka dahil na rin sa Lupus ko.) 

I'm feeling a bit hopeless kasi akala ko maganda na start ng career ko this 2024 but eto yung nangyari. I always thank God for His reasons but I pray na He will guide me sa throughout this battle.

Nanghihinayang ako kasi malapit na ako mag 8 years sa company sa september. Nanghihinayang ako sa benefits like HMO ng parents ko mbl 130k(though binabayran ko to less than 1k/monthly), up to 16th month pay at pag maganda ang kitaan ng company aabot 17th month, may pension plan ka na hinuhulugan si company once na umabot ka sa 5 yrs above and 5 days wellness leave on top of my sl vl conversion. Maganda naman sa Company namin kaso napakababa ng sahod at di maganda yung management sa department namin.

Eto naman yung mga dahilan bakit paulit ulit ako nagdedecide na gusto ko ng magresign.

‚Ä¢ 7 years going to 8 pero sahod ko nasa 22k lang sobrang hindi sya enough since may bahay ako binabayaran sa pag ibig, required magbigay sa parents ko and nagbabayad din ako ng rent sa boarding house ko plus my groceries.

‚Ä¢hirap mag leave ng 2 days magkasunod, ang dami pang negosasyong magaganap. Kaya may times di ko maiwasan di mag SL makapag pahinga lang at umiyak maghapon.. (Sorry sa mga TL at manager dito)

I said mandatory yung 13th month.

May nabasa naman akong exempt sa mandatory 13th month pay yung mga distressed employer. So ang tanong ko ay: 

Exempt naba talaga sila?

The startup company that I am working for told us last Thursday that they failed to secure an investment in which resulted to us getting laid off. I have worked for four years there and given that it's my main source of income, I am really saddened.

No hints about the lay off was given to us. A few months ago, they shared that they are applying for an investment grant and they did not tell us that the grant might make or break the company. So we really don't have any idea that we're going to be laid off few months later.

No severance pay. They said that they're still going to pay us for a month's worth. However, it's been a week since we're told about the lay off and they still don't have a specific date for our last day of work. It's really unfair because our pay period is every 24th. Beyond 24th, I will have no means of income. It means I have to be onboarded with my new job at least on the 25th.

2024-03-14 09:33:22,Text-only,Gusto kong sumabog at magsabi ng masasamang words! :(,"Hello. So first job ko to, and I‚Äôm already working 1+ year na. This is actually a big company and I‚Äôm not gonna disclose more info about it, but I‚Äôm a designer. Medyo mahabang rant to huhuhu.

So eto na nga, super rush palagi ng mga pagawa dito. I‚Äôm okay with it naman lalo na sa fast-paced environment, since nakaka-adapt naman ako and mabilis ako magtrabaho. Nakakainis na part lang is grabe yung utos nila lagpas na sa JD ko. One afternoon, ni-rush ako ng boss ko na gumawa ng logo design, take note, di ko to trabaho since may mga designers na nakatoka dito. But my supervisor told me na wala daw nagugustuhan ang VP sa designs na prinesent nila. Kinabukasan na agad need ang logo, and sad part is first time ko siya gagawin, and walang direction or guidance man lang since yung direct supervisor ko ay di naman maalam sa technicals ng design. Since bago palang ako nun, nag self study ako ng isang oras and gumawa ng ilang draft, luckily napili yung design ko. And now ginagamit na nila yun officially. Pero wala akong natanggap na reward dun, kahit thank you nga wala. Ang sabi lang sakin, ‚Äúbat mo ginalingan? sayo na tuloy mag-uutos yan hahaha‚Äù :‚Äô)

Also, super OA magwork ng lahat ng tao! 10hrs a day kami weekdays onsite, then inoobliga din magreport sa work ng weekends. Wala akong pake sa OT pay kasi mas gusto ko magpahinga and ayoko nagtatrabaho pag rest day. Nakakainis pag nagsasabi ka ng dahilan, iguguilt trip ka nila ng malala.

Another thing, since super introvert, shy, and socially anxious ako. Namimilit sila na isama ako sa mga performance, like sayaw ganyan. I told them my reasons naman na I can help with other things, pero sobra silang mang-asar. I took an SL nung christmas party kasi di ko na talaga sila kaya. Halos lahat sila extrovert and sobra akong naddrain sakanila. Tipong nagwowork ka ng maayos sa area mo, bigla may lalapit sayo tapos aasarin ka, then lahat ng attention ng tao nasayo na. I hate bida bida talaga!

But ito pinaka ayaw ko. Yung may ambagan pag may birthday/celebs. Juskoooo, halos lahat ng birthday obligado ka magbigay. Tapos ang mamahal pa ng mga binibili nila, since ‚Äúsosyal‚Äù daw sila.

Last thing. During my render period, I took a 1 day SL kasi I don‚Äôt feel like working that day. Super drained ako eh. And I just recently earned my paid leaves btw. After magpaalam kay supervisor, he told me na during this period daw wag daw muna ako mag-leave kasi unfair daw sakanila yun. Ewan ko bat ganun yung word na unfair, kasi sa pagkakaalam ko almost done na ko sa tasks ko, and wala naman ako masyado need i-turnover, I can even finish all that in one day eh. But eto pa malala, I asked HR if convertible ang leaves, and sabi sakin hindi daw sya sure, upon approval daw ng upper management pero hindi 100% sure. So feeling ko naman parang dinaya ako if ever di ko gamitin leaves and di sya convertible. Ang dami pa naman nun. :(

I get it in some contexts na necessary skills siguro. or mga volunteer events, company ganaps, sige gets. pero in my experience kasi, sa mga napapansin ko, and stories I've been told, mas madalas ginawa siya dahil understaffed yung office.

kung admin task na related sa work mo or sa functions ng unit mo, then go, pero yung ibibigay sayo trabaho ng ibang unit kasi kulang sila sa tao at ikaw lang available sa division, that's just unfair.

madadagdagan lang yung tasks pero yung sweldo hindi tumataas. apektado pa performance mo kasi bawas time mo to do what you actually needed to do. in the long run, mas mahal maghanap at train ng specialized staff (lalo in my industry na highly specialized but underappreciated)

Been officially unemployed for more than 6 months and job hunting has been brutal. It's been gnawing at my self-esteem and I don't have the confidence to respond to people trying to check up on me because I'm embarassed.

I applied for civil service eligibility, but because of government inefficiency and bureaucracy, I was told I have to wait for at least 5 months before getting my certificate. During this time of waiting, I missed opportunities to work in government positions, job vacancies in intergovernmental organizations, and other NGO's that preferred applicants with civil service certification. All of them required a copy of civil service certificate and all I have is a small stub of paper with my receipt attached.

I am so mad. I know it's on me for choosing not to enter corporate because I resolved for my first job to be in an organization that deals in advocacies and social development; a job with a bigger purpose beyond lining the pockets of greedy CEO's and shareholders.

I keep scrolling through my applications and I see these missed opportunities just because the government couldn't be bothered to improve governemnt service to expidite printing a piece of paper.

2024-03-12 08:07:22,Text-only,Income o Health (as a middle child),"Hi. 26M. Middle child. 

Ang hirap magpatuloy sa trabaho na sobrang overworked at stressed ka. Umabot na sa point na araw-araw sumasakit na yung ulo ko. Parang pinipiga at pumipitik na lagi yung ulo ko sa bawat oras. Naranasan ko na ito nung college pa ako at halos isang taon ako nagdusa dito na kailang ko pa magpacheck sa mga specialist doctors to the point na I underwent CT scans and MRI. Wala naman problema pero baka daw dahil na expose ako sa sobrang stress. They told me na to avoid stress talaga which I did at eventually nawala ng ilang months pa after. Ngayon, I'm currently working in a construction company at araw-araw doon exposed ako sa stress which eventually triggered my headaches again. Stress sa workload, sa mga toxic na boss at pati sa environment. 

Sumasakit yung ulo ko weeks after my employment. Tiniis ko baka nag aadjust pa lang ako sa lahat pero kalaunan ay lumala na to the point na hindi ko ma tolerate minsan ang sakit. I filed my resignation last week dahil sa takot na lumala pa pag nagpatuloy ako sa trabaho nato at tsaka na trauma ako sa past experience ko. I could barely eat and sleep properly back at college dahil sa sakit. I was always absent for 2 semesters. Gigising na lang ako dati ng 4 am dahil biglang sasakit yung ulo ko at wala akong magawa kundi iiyak na lang. From there, I notice na parang bumaba yung stress tolerance ko. 

Ngayon, parang sinusubukan ako kasi sa 6 kami sa aming pamilya, yung mother ko lang at ako ang may trabaho. Both my parents are already senior citizens. Yung father ko naman ay retired na pero wala pang natatanggap sa kaniyang pension. Wala din siyang means to earn money. Yung ate ko naman ay naghahanap pa ng trabaho. Nabuntis kasi kaya she had to stop for a few years para maalagaan ang kaniyang anak. Yung bunso namin ay college pa. Ang hirap lang kasi maliban sa maliit lang yung income ng ina ko, sabay pa nun ay parang sunod sunod na araw parang sinusubukan kami ngayon in terms of finances. Nakakatulong din naman ako ng kaonti lalo na sa maliit kong pamangkin pero I was also watching out kung ilan na lang ang matitira sa savings ko kung sakali maka alis na talaga ako sa trabaho, which is fully decided na rin ako kasi hindi ko rin matiis magpatuloy, kasi I was planning to start a private practice kaya kailangan tight ako sa savings.

Hindi din kami mayaman. Kahit sabihin ko na average yung kita ko pero hindi kasi balanced yung ratio. 2 lang kami ang may trabaho sa pamilya. At maliit lang yung salary ng mother ko talaga. Medjo demanding din kasi yung dalawa kong kapatid when it comes to their expenses. Sobrang bait kasi ng ina ko na sige lang ng sige kung mag provide sa mga gusto nila. Ako naman, kahit ilang beses ko ipa realize sa kanila at pagsabihan ang mga kapatid ko na wag masyadong mag demand ay parang hindi pumapasok sa kanilang isipan. Ito siguro yung outcome na palagi silang bini baby noon. Actually, inamin din sa akin ng ate ko na ako talaga yung mas mature sa amin. I had to. Kasi kung hindi, kawawa ang kalalabasan namin.

Hays, I'm really praying na magkaroon ako ng big break after I resign and start my private practice para masustain ko ang family ko. May naka line up naman na mga prospective projects pero I'm praying na matutuloy. Mostly, plano pa lang kasi pero thankful parin na atleast meron. I know I'm taking a big risk at this point na magpatuloy sa resignation ko pero hindi ko kasi kayang ma compromise yung health ko. Even my mother and relatives supports me sa pag alis sa trabaho.

The tricky part is, the anger I feel at work tends to follow me home. Unfortunately, I can't seem to control or manage these emotions, and I end up lashing out at work. I used to be a hardworking and approachable person that everyone enjoyed working with. But now, my job's high pressure and unrealistic demands, leading a team of 600 people in a service industry company, have changed me.

I've raised my concerns with my boss and the CEO, who I work closely with, explaining that I often feel like I'm on the verge of a mental breakdown. Leaving isn't an option for me, as I'm the breadwinner. Despite reporting directly to them at times, no concrete actions have been taken. I'm the only manager in my team, and I don't have any relief. Moreover, despite considering our CEO a mentor, there are frequent one-on-one sessions where I'm asked for opinions beyond my work scope, and I find myself listening to work rants. This, coupled with constantly overthinking solutions even after work hours, is taking a toll on my health. I'm considering seeing a psychiatrist to regain control of my surroundings.

I want to hit the gym for my mental and physical well-being, but it's expensive, and I'm unsure where to start. Being gay adds another layer of complexity, as I feel the need to overcompensate at work due to societal differences. Even the idea of going to the gym is intimidating. I tried dating, but it hasn't been helpful ‚Äì our busy work schedules leave little time for each other. I'm exhausted and hope everything falls into place soon. There's no option to truly rest and be present due to my constant overthinking.",2,2,1.0,Advice Needed ü§î,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/1bbv4sh/work_struggles/,1bbv4sh

2024-03-10 17:53:25,Text-only,Work Travel Plans Foiled. 33K Airfare goes down the drain.,"We are supposed to have a face to face training in Manila this coming week. Since we are from a province where this is only one flight per day, as soon as the announcement was made and memo was issued, we prepared approval papers for travel and booked flights ahead since our airfare is really costly.

Here comes one department head who told me that me and my team mate shall join the Visayas Batch, not the Luzon batch. We are from a province in Luzon.Tickets booked be damned. I asked for reconsideration but, apparently it's still a no go.

My problem is the ticket I booked cost our branch more than 33K for roundtrip airfare for two person. I didn't get the go-flexi of the Yellow Airline Company because it will be much more expensive, so I cannot reroute or refund our flight tickets. I can only rebook but the flights are mostly fully booked. 

In the end, the blame shall be put on me. Not on their mismanagement. Worried that the unusable ticket purchase will be disallowed and will be charged against me.

I filed a resignation letter sa immediate head ko at na approve naman, tas sunod na pinaakyat sa department head pero ayaw niyang pirmahan at ayaw niya akong pakawalan agad. She negotiated that I will render 3 months pa para makapag isip pero decided na po ako na ayaw ko na talaga. Apektado na po yung mental health ko pati pamilya ko pinapaalis na ako sa trabaho. I'm willing to render the 30 days notice period which I included naman sa resignation letter ko. Binalik ng department head namin ang resignation letter ko without signing it.

And regarding sa HR naman, ang proseso kasi samin dito, kailangan dumaan sa department head bago makarating sa HR ang letter ko. I'm not sure if this correct pero sabi ng officemates ko ganon daw. Ipapabalik lang ng HR yung letter ko kapag hindi dumaan sa department head namin. Kapag dumiretso kasi ako sa HR na hindi dumaan sa department head ay magkakaroon daw talaga ako ng problema. Lalong lalala ying situation ko. Yun ang sabi sa akin ng mga officemates ko.

Will I be considered awol kung aalis ako sa petsa ng araw na nilagay ko sa resignation letter ko bilang last working date dahil ayaw talaga pirmahan ng department head namin at the same time hindi mapapaakyat yung letter ko sa HR?

2024-03-10 20:26:38,Text-only,Unfair suspension.,"I just wanted some steps, ideas and to do next if I'm submitting a formal complaint against unfair suspension po saken ng company ko.

What happened is I've been suspended for 10 days now due to my supervisor unable to edit my timecard. We have what we call ADP (wherein you can timein online). I just only clocked in 30 mins prior to my shift para mabilis nalang maayos ko tools ko and everything, note: hindi po binabayaran yung 30 mins prio ko na clock in. I just want to make sure I won't forget to time-in.

Nirequest kami pumunta onsite and I'm sick. I tried to timein early online kase nga routinary lang ito. I also advised my team that I might be late due to traffic. Pagdating ko office I was late, 10 minutes. Advised my TL first verbally and nakita ko nagreflect nayung late sa system namin and advised him also sa teams with a screenshot to edit my timecard online. 

Few weeks later binabaan nila ako ng papel to be suspended, I was given chance to explain pero bulag sila sa negligence ng TL ko na hindi nya inedit timecard ko and the company is accusing me of fraud. My TL obviously didn't speak up. Sinabi pa nyang hindi daw sha nagtatago ng mga ""maling gawain"" pero obviously its his fault kahit I did not failed to notify. Alam ko pag ganto power tripping to.

I also had a case na sa system namin unable to proceed sa system namin walang case kundi iedit lang some of the details para lang makacontinue. Which is a bug. I acknowledge na fault koto nung una pero narealize ko na its the system fault din to begin with which the company failed to even acknowledge. They initially used this case as a bias para patawan ako ng 10 days suspension. 

This is too much. Nasira mental health ko ng sobra sobra dahil sa TL na incompetent at company na sobrang bias. ",0,8,0.11,Advice Needed ü§î,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/1bb96z8/unfair_suspension/,1bb96z8
2024-03-09 14:51:58,Text-only,Torn Resignation letter ,"Hindi ko inaakala na kayang punitin ng boss ko yung resignation letter ko sa harapan ko mismo at itapon lang sa basurahan kahapon. I felt devastated and felt pity for myself.  Sobrang unprofessional at unethical yung ginawa niya. Pakiramdam ko nabastos ako ng harap harapan kahit nakangiti yung department head sa akin. She was assuming na I agreed on her terms kahit I na hind pa naman. Sabi ko pag-iisipan ko.

 I understand that I'm barely 2 months from my current job pero sobrang napapagod na ako mentally. Sa sobrang stress ko sumasakit na yung ulo ko araw2 to the point napapapikit na ako sa sakit. Maliban don, gusto ko din talaga umalis kasi ang toxic ng pamamalakad dito sa amin. Kung tanungin nyo pa lahat ng mga kasama ko halos lahat sila ay pareho ang opinion at may iilan na nag submit din ng resignation dahil hindi kinaya.

I decided to file a resignation early this month hindi lang dahil sa workload kundi rin sa pressure at anxiety na nakuluha ko sa mga boss ko. I had a history during my college years na I was exposed with a severe stress which caused me to suffer intolerable headaches for almost a year that I even had to consult 2 or 3 neurologists and went through CT scan. MRI pa sana kaso wala na kaming pera. Wala naman problema sabi ng doctor pero sabi niya dahil daw sa stress. 

Going back, ngayon na nandito ako sa bago kong work at lalo na dahil sa construction field yung profession ko, hindi maiiwasan na mastress ako at sumasakit na uli yung ulo ko araw-araw. Ayaw ko at ng pamilya ko na maranasan ko ulit yung sa past ko kaya pinapaalis na nila ako sa current job ko. Hindi lang naman ako nag suffer noon kundi yung pamilya ko rin. Last week i filed my resignation sa immediate head namin and she understood my situation and signed it. Yung effectivity is until the end of March. Pero yung hindi ko lang kaya is hindi ako pinapayagan umalis ng department head namin ng ganito kaaga which she just recently discovered I was filing for resignation. I was still thinking about her offer about how to solve my situation at para hindi ako umalis agad pero she just assumed na sumang ayon ako at pinunit na yung resignation letter ko. 

I'm still in probationary period. Sa pagkakaalam ko, it can go both ways for the employee and the employer. They can fire me on the spot and I can leave on the spot, tama ba?

My concern is, should I print another and have it signed kahit hanggang sa immediate head lang namin. Kasi kung ipapaakyat ko ulit sa department head namin, she made herself clear na ayaw niya akon paalisin ng ganito kaaga. And about my notice period, should I be concerned about it too, knowing na pinunit yung una kong resignation so hindi ba sya macrecredit sa 30 days notice period? My immediate head suggested to print another one na lang at kung ano yung sa tingin ko na makakabuti sa akin ay gawin ko.

Im considering na mag awol. I dont care na sa COE. I need to prioritize my health. Ayaw ko lang may hahabulin yung company ko sa akin after na umalis ako kahit hindi pirmado yung letter ko.

also, i am currently suffering from a fever and asked for a sick leave today. handbook states that i cannot use leaves during 30 day render unless it is a sick leave. i asked my manager about it because usually a day leave doesnt need a med cert and now he said that they need a med cert because mondays and fridays are now critical work days?? based on our guidelines, critical working days are announced a month tapos biglang may paandar na ganito. i had to hurry up to go to the nearest doctor pero buti the csr of the hmo said use their affiliated app na lang which i did

I recently went back to office since I changed my position in the company. For reference, I (29 M), single and closet bisexual has been WFH for a good chunk of my stay in my current workplace. 

I am usually straight passing (not a particularly good trait), but since I am bisexual it is not new. Since I started working I noticed that my field (which is engineering) is particularly peppered with ‚Äútoxic masculinity‚Äù men and adherance to ‚Äúmacho men‚Äù. I even left one of my workplace since I had a really nasty bout of teasing for not being a ‚Äústereotypical‚Äù single man. 

Anyways, my coworker, suddenly out of nowhere said to me and I quote:

Male Coworker: ‚ÄúAkala ko [name redacted], alagad ka ni Krystala‚Äù

Me: ‚ÄúAno yun?!‚Äù

Then followed a discussion about TV shows since I really do not know what he just said. 

Later on I asked some of my friends and they basically said that my coworker tagged me as gay. 

Anyways, I know that some of you might just say that I am just ranting because I am closeted. But being a member of the LGBTQ, I don‚Äôt really judge someone on their gender unless they say that they are straight, gay or another gender. I also believe that my gender doesn‚Äôt matter on the quality of my work or my performance. 

I would also like to add that most people had a ‚Äústereotypical‚Äù view of the members of the LGBTQ people. And would basically casually say something that are usually NSFW.

Obviously not talking about Fraternity Level Hazing (Unless you are aware of this, then please call for help), mostly in-office performances or what else na pakulo ng management na walang budget for teambuilding. I still cringe remembering being asked to crossdress to Jessie J's Bang Bang with 2 other guys. Wouldn't say it's gone though but there's less *kupals* in Lead positions now and there's no one actively pushing to dive in to gross topics and the ones being peer pressured. Definitely the move to Remote Work killed a lot of avenues sa mga manggugulang na ka co-workers and forced exposure.

Some context, I've been with my company for \~5 years by now, I've had teams come and go and my most recent staff is mostly newer younger people around my age. I don't think I've ever really had  any recent new hires go through the same embarrassment I did.  Every now and then there's still always going to be some jack-off sub-team who's assigned to do the In-Office Icebreaker who's agenda is to create something stretching the limits of what can be appropriate in an office setting.

I had a mini reunion with an older team of mine with mostly older folks who've moved on to other stuffs and most of their discussion were into raunchier in-office gossip (Like putangina sino nagchecheat sa asawa nila, sino may STD, sino sumisipsip). Makes me a bit happy that my current team of people, the raunchiest of gossip we got is like celebrity break-ups or what anime they're watching.

Nag simula kasi ito nung umuwi ako galing sa project namin which is nasa  Misamis Occidental, December 19 yun (pero ang usapan namin mga December 18 sana kasi mag prepare kami ng asawa ko sa wedding namin sa December 23) pero ayun nga pinapasok pa kami nun, kasi kinabukasan nun hanggang January 2 di ako papasok nun, pero alam naman nila kasi nga kasal and honeymoon, then fast forward, tapos na ang new year so pasukan na, nag report ako nung January 4 na, nagpaalam ako na di ako nung January 3 na di ako makakapasok kasi medyo nahirapan kami ni misis na makapag book ng bus sa Baguio. So ayun nga dumating na ako sa office then tinanong ko kung pwede ko na makuha yung 13th month ko, ang sabi ng asawa ng boss ko (yung asawa kasi ang finance manager nila) nasa boss ko daw yung 13th month ko, nasa sasakyan niya daw, nasa Masbate ang boss ko and na confirm naman ito ng boss ko na nasa kanya nga yung pera, tinatawagan daw ako ni boss nung 22, kaso siyempre dahil nga gahol na kami at dami pa naming ginawa sa preparation namin sa kasal di ko na naasikaso na tawagan or masagot ang call ng boss ko (somehow may mali din ako sa part na ito) pinapakuha niya daw kasi yung 13th month ko sa office nun. So ako sinabi ko na busy kami nung time na yun, kaya sabi niya pagbalik niya daw ibibigay, kaso kinabukasan nun flight namin bound to Mindanao project namin, so di ko na nakuha yung 13th month ko. So andito ako sa Mindanao panay follow up sa pera ko, kaso andami na nilang excuse na binigay, kesyo nagastos na daw ni boss yung pera, ibibigay daw pag nakasingil sa isang project, ibibigay daw pagpunta dito at ngayun pag uwi ko daw this March ibibigay sa akin. Nakaka frustrate pero kahit anong follow up ko ganyan lagi ang rason nila, pinagpapasahan ako ng boss ko at asawa niya. Anyways hope maibigay na nila pag uwi ko kasi pag hindi pa din, ireklamo ko na sila sa DOLE, at resign na din. Maganda ang salary pero walang benefits (sss,phic at hdmf) wala din ako pinirmahan na contract kaya not sure kung pakinggan din ako ng DOLE. Anyways salamat sa oras sa pagbabasa ng kwento ko. Update ko kayo pag uwi ko this Friday kung anong rason ulit nila. Again thanks ulit

I declined to provide the info requested. Aside from it being confidential, I think I‚Äôd be on the losing end if they got all those information without even a job offer from them. I politely told them that if they would extend an offer, they can provide the standard package for the role and we can negotiate from there. I was willing to show my payslips once a job offer has been extended. HR said they understood but still asked for my asking salary range (which I gave every interview).

I resigned from my previous job last year and I still have a pending clearance with them. Okay lang naman kasi may agreement na kami ng mga boss and managers re the issue.

Now, I found a new job and one of their pre-employment requirements is a certificate of employment (COE) from the last company. 

So, nag-request ako ng COE to my ex-employer's HR and they said na hindi nila ako bibigyan ng COE until hindi ko pa nase-settle yung pending clearance ko. 

Is the HR really allowed to refuse my COE request even though it is my right to ask for it, as a former employee, for whatever purposes I may use it for? Even DOLE's released a memo that an ex-employee may request for a COE and the company should give it to me within three working days upon request.

2024-03-05 17:51:18,Text-only,Is my issue DOLE-able?,"Greetings all!

I was a healthcare worker in a government hospital for a year. I submitted my resignation letter last year and the HR personnel gave me a date that I should put as my resignation's effectivity date which I followed. 

I unfortunately was not able to render service since I was having mental health issues and at the same time was preparing shits as I am about to migrate out of the country, hence the resignation. 

I was always reaching out to HR and going there personally to ask for the things that I need to do to get my clearance and possibly backpay. The HR  personnel then told me to not expect any backpay and I might be the one who's indebted to them since they'll be deducting my absences from my backpay since I have don't have any leaves left. 

I was confused since I thought that our policy was no work, no pay. So I at least should be paid for the days I came in for that month. She gave me the clearance form which has the list of departments I needed signatures from and I did it the same day it was given to me. Yet when it came to the HR head, she told me to leave the papers with her since the HR head was on leave. 

Days, weeks have passed and my departure date was getting near and still, my papers haven't been signed. I started feeling that it may be intentional since I feel like I did my part on asking what are the things I need to do or sign before I go and she kept on insisting that I should just have an ""S.P.A"" to finish things for me, which I found odd since I can do it while I am still here. 

But whenever I ask for an update, it's either she's on leave or the HR head is on leave. Mind you, this issue has been going on from Sept (the effectivity date of my resignation) and it's March now. 

I have a work friend who's consistently asking for updates on my behalf and today, I was shocked by something. HR called her to get my documents, which was my clearance form, and have it signed by the departments that haven't yet. THE CLEARANCE FORM I LEFT TO THAT PERSONNEL WAS JUST AS IT WAS BEFORE I LEFT THE COUNTRY. Meaning, nothing has been done since I left the papers with her. I find it absolutely ridiculous.

I just wanted to get everything over with as I know that I won't get any of my benefits if I am not cleared. Is it really like this working for the government? Does it really take this much time? Is it legal to deduct my absences from my last pay? And should I take my case to DOLE?

Since then, humina kami but I have monthly sales pa din as same noong pagpasok ko sa company. 

To make the story short, I resigned because of the pressure. Now yung Car naiwan sa kanila. Since hindi ko siya natapos bayaran. 

I got my last pay yesterday lang, but they told me hindi na nila ibabalik yung payment ko sa Car. Is it really like that? Or may habol ako?

Nakakatawa lang yung passive agressiveness - nakaleave kasi ako this week (1 day lang naman) pero dahil may mga miss ako last week, naimpromtu one on one ako at sabi sakin ‚Äúnakaleave ka pa naman, pero di ko sinasabi na icancel mo leave mo‚Äù 

Tapos tinatanong sakin ano daw ba nangyayare sakin. Bakit ang distracted ko daw, kulang sa passion, (kulang nalang ipoint out sakin dahil toddler mom ako. Ayaw daw dumatin sa point na irequire nya ako everyday RTO para makapagfocus daw ako.) 

Regarding sa KPI - nung una parang okay naman, kayang imeet yung targets, kaso yung mga dati kong client, lumalapit sakin, may bagong demand, shempre iaacccomodate ko yun. Sabay itatanong wala naman daw pinapagawa bakit parang naooverwhelm ako. 

Balik sa RTO, nacompare ako kasi mas madami pa daw nga na galing province samin at nagRTO samntala ako may car at hatid sundo ng asawa minsan nagrereklamo pa. 

Then lastly, I know I should act like my salary grade. Team Lead. Eh kapag ako magllead ng call, siya magttake over. Kapag naman hinahayaan ko, dapat I assert myself. Kapag nagassert, sasabihin nabypass. 

Lastly, nacall out ako dahil 2x ako nagstep out for 30 mins. Pati yon napuna. Eh inuubo nga ako tapos ang lamig lamig ng room at shempre ayoko makahawa at may mga calls din yun ibang teammate ko.

2024-03-02 00:30:46,Text-only,Is this considered power tripping?,"Gf is a nurse and works for a hospital as an ER staff. On the 3rd week of March, we will be travelling for a family event. She filed a VL for 7 days and it was filed the last week of Feb. The VL was approved by her supervisor (Head nurse) however this was rejected by someone higher from their department. (We'll call this person -- Person A)

The head nurse told my gf that her request was rejected. ^((1)) She says Person A said that they can't file a leave after the day of their day offs AND ^((2)) that she (my gf) has been given a chance since she used a LOA last year. ^((3))  Lastly, the head nurse told my gf that Person A said that it's either ""Resign or (Hospital name)"". Implying that they either have to work or resign.

^((1)) This doesn't make any sense especially in the past, my gf and her coworkers would take a VL after their day off. (Day off, day off, **VL**)

^((2)) Now, my gf had to use a LOA last year for almost a month to focus for her NCLEX exam. This was approved by everyone required to approve the LOA **including** Person A. After the LOA my gf went back working and she doesn't even have poor attendance at all and been working diligently. Sometimes pulling off a lot of OTs to help out after her shift.

This Person A just implied that employees from their department aren't allowed to take a vacation / trip with their family for a week then? It's either resign to enjoy your vacation (which you are entitled to) or work under a toxic management?

Points:

* VL request was filed 2 weeks earlier
* VL was approved by the Head Nurse who is in charge of making the schedule. (meaning the vacation leave was already considered and applied when their schedule for March was created)
* Person A, who has a higher position rejected the VL even tho their schedule was already good and there are nurses to cover for my gf during her leaves

Questions:

1. Is it valid for Person A to bring up the LOA when he himself was one of those who approved the LOA last year?
2. Is this considered power tripping?

We asked and asked for time to process this information because we JUST essentially lost our livelihood, and asked if this **redeployment** had a severance package to which they said **NO** to. Walang magiging separation pay, HR and Recruitment would find new ""homes"" for us at the company, and effectively we are already rendering our final 30 days with the company. And if makahanap si HR and recruitment ng bagong work for us within the company we would need to undergo reassessments and re-certifications. 

All of us that were laid off has 2+years of tenure. We asked about the basis ng pagpili sa list ng mga ma\*reredeploy\* and apparently they didn't even look at our performance evaluations, the only thing that they looked at was a ""Last hired, First out"" basis (naging stock pa kami sa 711) 

I just celebrated my 2nd year work anniversary with this company and hindi ako ang last hire within the team. Even based on tenure, I was previously a part of another team before I pioneered this team that I'm with right now. And sobrang nakaka confuse lang on why they didn't even look at our performance when deciding on who would be severed from the company.  

I'm so disappointed on how they handled our case and how they chose the names off that list kasi we were all performing well, we were all doing our jobs, and now we have to deal with the fact that we just lost it.

Ang kacheapan ng reliasourcing, hindi naman endorsement mangyayari, magaapply ka ulit sa client. Initial at final interview ulit. Kung ako dun sa mga naendorse wag na nila ituloy. Maghanap na sila ng bigger company. Don't be a bitch sa pipitsugin kumpanya. üñïüñïüñï

Yung mga trip naman nila pag-stayin kahit may mga benta, imbes na JO na naging 1 month probitionary pa. Yung isang performer is expected to bring $25,000 as monthly revenue. ü´®ü´®ü´®ü´®

üëπüëπ MIDLEADING üëπüëπ

Ewan ko ba nabola rin ko ng mga hayop. Yung production nila parang kuta ng pogo yung hitsura. Hindi maayos. Mema mema. When i asked about it sabi nila nakalaan daw yung pera ""pangmudmod"" sa mga performer.

Ipapakita during interview yung incentives ng mga performer. It will sound like na kaya kahit ng mga newbie na kumita ng 5 to 6 digits as incentives on top ng monthly salary mo. To good to be true talaga kaso nakakasilaw eh. Edi tuloy ako. 

Pagstart mo ng training, deputa. Pang-intern lang yung sahod mo for 1 week. Mababa pa nga eh. 59% ng regular daily rate ang pasahod. Minus the promised allowance.  PERO NAKAKADECEIVE talaga yung üåüüåü with unlimite commisionüåüüåü and PHP100,000 as incentives kaya nagtuloy lang kami. 

Pagdating namin sa production, ang konti ng tao. At mukhang come and go lang sila. Yung pinagmamalaki nilang comission are being distributed only to the elite fews. Tapos yung mga tenured na yun nagpakasasa na sa pambubudol.

Narealize ko...  Hindi attainable sa newbie yung 100k pangbudol lang nila. Sa mga newbie need mong makabenta ng $15,000 in a month with other metrics para makakuha ng $200. 

May benta naman ako bago ako mag-awol kaso di kaya ng konsenya ko magstay sa kumpanyang borderline scammer. Customers were ugly crying just to get refunded.

‚ùåBudol ang Reliasourcing. Cheap ng training at hindi stable ang employment. 

‚úÖ Apply ka na lang sa company na may JO day 1 pa lang ng training. Or may JO na bago ka pa start. JO is a good assurance na ike-keep ng company ang sinabi nila during the application process.

2024-02-28 16:55:17,Text-only,My boss wants me to work on my day off.,"Nasstress ako sa boss ko. I get it that we need to send email for our leave requests and I understand that it is subject for approval. We render OTs on weekdays and RDOTs on weekends (yung weekdays namin umaabot ng 8-10hrs yung nirerender namin plus another 8hrs RDOT) With that, parang covered na namin yung 7days and more pa a week na rendering ng work because of OTs. Now, nalaman ko na may update na pati pala yung pag ayaw mo or di ka pwede magrender ng RDOT ay need i-email and subject din pala for approval. Meron akong gagawin sana this weekend and hindi ko sya naisend kaagad sa email. Chinat ko kaagad yung boss ko na if need pa ba magsend ng email pra ipaalam na di ako mag rerender ng Rest Day OT. sabi nya oo and sige magsend daw ako ng email. So nag send ako ng email kasi nag usap na kami via chat bago ako mag email then nalaman ko na disapproved yung hindi ko pag render ng RDOT. I was actually mad kasi first of all, rest day ko iyon so bakit kailangan ko pa ipaalam na hindi mo papasukan and subject for approval sya? Now lang nagkaron ng changes ng ganito and madali naman akong kausap sa OTs. Pero nakakapag taka at nakakainis na need din palang iapprove kung ayaw mo mag RDOT. Kahit inis na inis ako, triny ko pakiusapan yung boss ko via chat and explained na mayroon talaga akong gagawin nyan na hindi ako makakapasok and I tried to compromise that I will render 2hr daily OTs for next week para makabawi. He again said sige and magreply ako sa naunang email. Again, I just read na ang nilagay nya naman sa email, approved yung hindi ko pag render ng RDOT BUT, I need to render 2hrs OT ON TOP OF THE MANDATORY WEEKDAY OTS. So kung may mandatory OT ng 1hr, I need to render 3hrs. if 2hrs, I need to do 4. Pagod na ako to be honest. Ayoko din mangupal kasi mas gusto ko yung maayos na usapan I am really trying to compromise sa mga mawawala ko pero feel ko na pinagiinitan ako ng boss ko and di ko alam kung bakit. Hindi rin naman sya nagsasabi sakin. Everytime may absences ako especially kapag sl, kahit 1 day lang, lagi akong may back up proof. Hindi rin naman ako pala absent pero eto lang naman yung hinihingi ko din na hindi pumasok ng weekend. Valid ba tong inis ko and pwede ba yun sa labor laws na hindi ka papayagan magtake ng scheduled rest day ang tao mo? or kahit yung extended OTs? Oo nga pala. Di pa ako makapag resign kasi naghahanap pa ako hahaha gusto ko lang din sana maglabas ng sama ng loob at the same time if mayroon kayong advice. Sana walang makakilala sa akin dito haha Thank you.

2024-02-28 18:58:12,Text-only,Job hunting here in PH,"Im in confused or maybe in tricky situation doing job hunting here in ph.

For context:

My first job here is in ph as implementation officer. Implementing business function on the client side, doing technical demo or training. Tumagal ako dito sa company na to hanggan sa napromote ako in Supervisory position.

Then after 3 years I left the company kasi parang wala na movement to go up. Saka I want to learn and explore more in depth in IT kaya nagresign ako then got my 2nd job as System engineer doing texc support, QA‚Äôs and back end support kasi maliit lang yun it group. So this job is good for learning a lot of new things in IT. Nasa track na ako in IT career king hindi lang nakakuha ng wife ko ng job sa U.S. as faculty.

At that time since, hindi naman ganun kalakihan ang sahod at may 4 na anak, nagdecide kami na igrab yun opportunity dun sa U.S. and with that reason, I resign to my work and decide to follow/support my wife. I moved to US and my kids as well to live in US. Got the job there but not in IT position. At that time, hirap makapasok as IT officer since hinahanap nila is yun may green card na. Pinanghahawakan ko lang is work permit but my visa is sponsorship visa lang. i got work there in Manufacturing industry. So i started as production associate and napromote din as Quality assurance officer. My job there is to do electrical/physical inspections of electrical switchboard. Yun mga malalaking electrical cabinet na to control electrical supply within the building. More on electrical engineering functions kumbaga ang ginagawa ko since im reading electrical designs, sde and other documents. Mapropromote na sana ako as Engineering Auditor kung di lang talaga maeexpired yun working visa ko.

Now come after my 5 years sa US at need na namin bumalik ph (span ng sponsoship visa) . We tried all avenues to stay indefinitely sa US pero wala talaga and decide na lang na umuwi na lang para walang bad record sa US kung may pagkakataon na makabalik. Nakabalik ako last year and decide na magpahinga muna since moving my family from US back here in PH is really stressful at may konti naman kami naipon para makapagrelaxs kahit konti.

So now naghahanap ako, mga inaapplyan ko is more on IT uli since yun naman background ko before ako umalis sa ph. At wala rin naman manufacturing company doing electrical panels/cabinet para suited dun sa last job ko pero im trying also applying in manufacturing company as production engineering or as test engineer thinking na in line naman kahit papaano to sa last job ko. Im applying, test engineers, production engineer, it support/system engineering ,service engineer or even QA. Mostly yun inaaplyan ko is mga level 1 or level 2 position basta may 20k na monthly lang pede na sa akin. Hindi naman ako nag aapply as Supervisor lalo na sa IT since yun experience ko is mababaw palang in IT.

With all those application na submit ko at interviews na napupuntahan ko, lagi ako nadedeny due to this reasons;

1. Yun inaaplyan ko is level 1 or level 2 lang pero yun resume ko is pang supervisor na raw. Overqualified daw kasi naging supervisor na ako though almost 10 years na nun naging Supervisor ako.
2. Applying level 1/2 jobs pero 36 na ako so seems na matanda na raw ako for that position.
3. Nakakaala daw sa kanila yun pag iba ko ng indust

Nag apply na rin ako as service engineer kaso wala rin ako experience dun sa product nila. Im applying for these position thinking na pede ko naman matutunan mga yan dahil may background naman ako as IT tech and support pero negative. Sometimes may feeling ako na intmidated din yun nag iinterview dahil sa experience na nasa resume.

Alam ko naman mejo weak ang resume ko since from IT naging manufacturing industry ako nun nasa US. So hindi ganun kasolid ang IT experience ko.

May masusuggest po ba kayo para magkajob na rin. Hindi naman ako nag aasam ng mataas na position o sahod. Kahit 23k to 25k lang na sahod pede na aa akin.",1,1,1.0,Advice Needed ü§î,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/1b23ctk/job_hunting_here_in_ph/,1b23ctk

Dati pa lang nababanggit na nya saken na ayaw nya tumanda na teacher. Well, masaya sya sa pagtuturo. Nakikinig ako palagi sa mga kwento nya sa naging atae nya habang nagdidinner kami. Gusto nya na nagdedesign ng slides and nagdedecorate. Kaso, na-reach na ata ang threshold nya. 

This month, observe ko yung pagod nya. Nagsabay-sabay ang school activities. Tapos expected pa sa kanila na tapos lahat ng checkables and grades the week after the school event na teachers din ang nag-organize (btw my partner works in a privage schooll). Sa kanilang mga teacher, isa sya sa binigyan ng maraming subject preps this sem. On top of it, may advisory pa sya and pinaghahandle ng event. Ako yung nahihirapan para sa kanya at sa sitwasyon nya. Pagkarating sa bahay, baba lang nh bag tapos scroll sa phone - ito na lang pahinga nya. Pagkakain ng dinner, work na naman. 

Tanda ko sunday non, pumasok sya ng room ko umiiyak. Pagod na pagod na daw sya. Gusto lang naman nya na makapahinga bg weekends and magawa gusto nya kaso need pa din magtrabaho. Ramdam ko yung bigat sa balikat nya at sa bawat hakbang nya, as someone na umalis din sa teaching. Kanina nagsabi na sya, gusto na nya magquit. This time, feeling ko heto na yun. 

Sinamahan ko sya hanggang sa makatulog sya. Sinusuntok nya kasi yung pader kaya alisto ako. Pero sa totoo lang, mas mabigat yung pakiramdam ko. Pressured din siguro sya kasi nanghihingi sa kanya immediate family members nya. And yes ang hirap ng buhay.

Enough with ""manage mo lang mga tasks mo"" advices because you're taking souls from people!! May hinanakit ako sa mga school adminis na hindi iniisip ang kalagayan ng mga teachers nila (i'm not talking about wellness seminars). Wag nyong samantalahin yung passion sa pagtuturo ng mga tao kasi kahit pagod sila physically, mentally, and emotionally sa unreasonable workload na ibinibigay nyo, they still try their best to show up... for the kids. Pero maawa naman kayo. Iayon ang pasahod sa workload tang*** 

Di ko alam kung papasok sya bukas. Di ko alam kung anong balak nya. Sabi ko na lang thru chat na kung anong maging decision nya, nandito lang ako. 

Sorry ang bigat bigat ng dibdib ko hindi ko alam kung anong dapat kong gawin o maramdaman. Hindi din ako makapagtrabaho nang maayos. Gusto ko din umiyak. Normal ba to? Huhu

Lastly, kapwa engineer ko na walang kakwenta kwenta, nagawa lang kung magpapasipsip sa boss(yup that's what my instinct says).

So first off, PIC ko, my time na 3 pa kaming field engineer, inom lang sila ng inom ako yung naiiwan parati sa site na 50+ hectares.

Eh yun na nga pinakisamahan ko na yung isa, dadagdagan pa. As of now, he's drinking alcohol na naman. HAHA

Secondly, Safety Officer. Very vocal na magnanakaw. At pot*ngina pakita lang sa umaga tapos na araw. Gusto mo pa kahit sunday na di napasok nakatime-in ka. 

Lastly, kapwa Field Engineer ko, yun nga sees himself so above others, also wala talagang kapaki pakialam sa mundo but seems like siya yung good shot kay boss. Maybe my fault kase simpleng reporting hindi ko mabigay. Eto pa, lasinggero din, kainoman niya actually ngayon yung PIC namin, for sure di na naman makakapasok ng umaga like everyday na siyang ganyan. What offends me the most dito sa kupal na to.

2024-02-24 00:05:33,Text-only,Feeling Company Successor,"So I work sa isang Substation as a ROW (Right of way) worker and our task is to communicate and negotiate sa mga land owners na dadaanan ng line ng mga towers ng kuryente. Yung sahod desente naman kaya bumuhay naman kaya talagang naenganyo ako pumasok sa company yun ngalang naassign ako da ibang substation na kabilang probinsya which is isang bus pa galing saamin di tulad kung saan ako nag apply na isang jeep lang nandun agad ako. Sakin goods naman yon dahil ayos nga yung sahod na ibibigay malaki laki kumpara sa iba kaya nag go ako kahit medyo malayo nag grab ako ng opportunity. Newly graduate pala kami halos na nag apply at sa awa ng Diyos naka pasok sa company do yun nanga bali kontrata kasi dito sa ROW department at second batch napala kami dito mga kasama ko nag apply kaya talagang back to zero kami at need pagaralan yung trabaho which is normal naman, wala naman siguro baguhan sa trabaho na super galing na agad diba? Naintindihan naman yon ng mga seniors namin at nag pursigi kami na matutunan yung trabaho ayos naman samahan sa work namin may mga panahon na wala ginagawa may mga panahon na sobrang busy typical na working environment ba. Hanggang nag start nakaming mag field which means na pupunta kami sa mga land owners na kakausapin at inenegotiate namin dito na nagstart yung tunay na trabaho. Eto pinaka mahirap sa trabaho pero enjoy naman yun ngalang yung field namen e halos 3- 4 hours dipende sa traffic bago ka makadating from the substation papunta palang yon. Tas pabalik ganun din katawag which means sa travel time palang kakain na ng oras, eto nanga unang field namen call time e 4am sobrang aga halos wala pangang masasakyan non pahirapan e galing pako probinsya almost 1 hour byahe 3am palang otw nako tapos before 4 am andun naako and waiting for our seniors and co workers bali company car sasakyan namin papunta sa mga land owners at nakarating kami dun ng halos mag 8-9am na dipa nakapg almusal dahil sobrang aga pa nang gising di naman ako nag aalmusan ng alas 3 ng umaga, so yun nanga pagdating namin don almusal muna which is own expense ahh yakr note ,at after kumain palang magstart ang trabaho which is pagpunta sa landowners and to negotiate 
. Tinuruan kame pano tamang procedures at natutu naman kami onti onti hangga magamay nanamin pano yung patakaran sa trabaho, lunch kami ulit nagastos kami din gumagastos da pagkain ng driver namin hati hati kami kasi medyo mababa sahod ng driver yun ata yung tradisyon niladon saakin goods man mag ambag dahil laking tulong din ng driver namin after ng lunch work ulit hangga natapos na yung work halos mag alas 5 na at nasa land owner pa kami non bali makabalik kami sa substation halos 8-9pm ng gabi at uuwi pako samin kaya minsan late na ako makauwi. Patuloy yung sa tuwing nag fiefield kami minsan maaga umuwi pero madalas late na uuwi .kung minsan naman friday to sunday yung field namin at pinapahotel kami don company pay naman yung accommodation yung umagahan libre na sa hotel minsan pero pag need magbyahe kahit nasa hotel na kami near sa mga land owner super aga alis na agad kahit dipa start ng working hours.

Ayos lang naman mag work ng overtime e yung pangit ngalang di nababayaran yung overtime namin bali kahit gaano pa kaaga meeting time namin at gaano man katagal bago matapos ang work di yun counted sa binabayad samin. Example 4am meeting time tas makadating kami ng substation ng 8pm which is 15 hours excluded yun 12-1 na lunch break hindi bayad yon. Tapos sariling gastos pa sa pagkain and pangit kasi don e may per dime na pinapasa para sa food expense pero di pinipirmahan ng teamleader namin yon kahit yung overtime dapat na maybayad din ayaw niya asikasuhin , at ang reason nya ayaw nya mamoblema sa company .

2024-02-23 16:58:56,Text-only,Can I resign immediately?,"This may be somewhat ironic, kasi as an HR alam ko na kailangan ung 30 days na rendering. Pero here are my several thoughts kung OKAY LANG BA NA MAG IMMEDIATE RESIGN NA AKO. 

1. I work in the HR dept. I was diagnosed with Major Depressive and of course most of my days is down talaga yung mood ko. As in. ganon. And namisinterpret ako ng mga co workers ko as offended or serious daw ganon, pero tbh, naka autopilot ako. There are times na feeling ko na lang is pinanonood ko sarili ko na magtrabaho. 
2. Yung private na usapan namin between me and my immediate supervisor, akala ko sa aming dalawa lang, hindi pala, nakakarating din pala sa iba naming ka-dept. considering na medyo private yung usapan namin. So and ending, namisinterpret na naman ako ng iba naming colleague. Naooffend daw ako sa mga jokes nila, which in my case, hindi ako naooffend, but there are some jokes na belong ung I.T namin na sobrang bastos at manyak talaga nung dating. Dun ako naiinis, kasi hindi appropriate setup para mangbastos ung office. Puro misinterpret, pero di naman nila ako kinakausap kung ano ba talaga yung problema. 
3. so nalaman ko from a friend na pinag-usapan pala nila ako during lunch time. Ang sabi, nagdadabog daw ako kasi yung pagstamp ko raw and ung pagbukas ko ng printer. Sabi ng isa naming colleague, nagsorry daw siya pero di ko raw pinansin (pinansin ko nman siya sabi ko ok lang yun), tapos sabi nung isang hr officer na hirap daw silang intindihin ako, tas ako na raw may problema. nagtatanong ako na bakit hindi na lang ako yung kinausap nila, instead na gawin nila akong pulutan during lunch. So nakarating sa akin yng news, yung hr officer na nagsabi na nahihirapan daw akong intindihin, sinabihan niya yung friend ko na ""I'm disappointed in you, sinabi mo sa kanya yung mga pinag-usapan natin."" Diba dapat sa sarili nila madisappoint sila? kasi mga supervisor sila pero ganon sila mag act sa subordinates nila? 
4. deliberate na nila akong iniignore, inunfriend na ako ng mga workmates namin, and hindi daw nila alam kung paano ako pakikisamahan. kinausap ko yung immediate supervisor ko regarding this, sinabi niya nga na ang draining ko raw sa work kasi ang moody ko raw and hindi raw nila alam pano daw ako pakikisamahan. Mood disorder yung diagnosis sakin, ang hiningi ko lang naman is konting emapthy and compassion. Mga Psych grad pa naman sila and yung immediate sup ko may RPm license. 
5. akala ko tapos na, kasi nag usap na kami nung immediate sup ko. sabi ko, saming dalwa na lang ung napag-usapan, tapos napagkwentuhan na naman nila nung isang HR Officer, tas ito na yung time na inunfrien ako ng most ng coworkers ko. 
6. Ayoko na pumasok considering na hostile na yung environment at expected ko na magiging hostile pa ito lalo na kapag bumalik ako after ng Sick leave ng isang linggo. Gusto ko na umalis. Hindi na kaya ng mental health ko to the point na nag increase yung dosage ng gamot ko becauase of the workplace stress.

2024-02-23 17:10:40,Text-only,Stand Up for Our Unsung Heroes: Support Better Salary and Benefits for Non-Uniformed PNP Staff,"Non-uniformed personnel of the Philippine National Police (PNP) play a crucial role in maintaining law and order, often working under hazardous conditions similar to their uniformed counterparts. Despite this, they do not receive comparable compensation or benefits. These dedicated individuals are exposed to danger during their duty in police stations and work under exigent circumstances, yet their remuneration does not reflect these risks. It is essential that we address this disparity to ensure fairness and encourage commitment among these vital workers.

&#x200B;

According to data from the PNP itself, there are thousands of non-uniformed personnel serving across the country. Their roles range from administrative tasks to technical support - all integral parts of our policing system. Yet, they face significant financial challenges due to inadequate salary packages.

&#x200B;

We call upon the government and relevant authorities to review and enhance the salary structure, allowances, and benefits for non-uniformed personnel within PNP. This will not only provide them with fair compensation but also boost morale among these hardworking individuals who contribute significantly towards public safety.

&#x200B;

Join us in urging for a change that recognizes their service appropriately by signing this petition today.

Hearing sched is Feb 26 Monday. (It was rescheduled 3 times already!)

Today, Feb 23, received an email from the company's legal counsel that my last pay check is available, but they are requesting me to withdraw my complaint to NLRC.
I dont plan on withdrawing my complaint. 

QUESTION/s:
1: I want to get compensation for
the 7 months inconvenience. Is that possible? If so, how do I say that during the hearing this monday? 

2. Will I have someone representing me during the hearing or will I be conversing directly with the company's legal counsel?

I recently posted on this sub about how toxic our management has become, and how I couldn't wait to resign. Today, I finally did ü•π

On Monday, I got an email for my JO with one of the companies I applied to. It took two weeks for them to get back to me and I actually thought di na ako ma-cconsider for the role. I also had 2 interviews that day tapos after ng mga yon, nanghingi akong sign kasi ayoko na talaga sa current job ko. Then I received an email regarding my job offer minutes later. At first, na-overwhelm ako kasi na-realize ko na medyo alanganin pala yung pag-apply ko. Bonus na kasi ng April and since natagalan yung job offer, I thought, why not just wait it out until then. Pero ayun nga nag-email na sila nung Monday. Naisip ko rin na wag muna tanggapin kasi if di okay ang offer, then I'll keep looking pa. Sa sobrang stress ko kasi, simula November 2023, nag-update akong resume ko para by January, makapag-apply na ako. Nagda-dalawang isip pa nga ako last month pero every time na merong di okay na mangyari sa office, nag-aapply ako pag-uwi. Parang every time I come in to that office and start my day, answering calls (CSR ako), lagi akong nabibigyan ng hundred reasons to leave. Everyday kong na-rrealize na hindi talaga siya para sa akin and hindi ko na kayang tumagal pa. Ang baba rin kasi ng sahod so bakit pa ako mag-ssuffer. The universe heard me and ito na yung sign na hiningi ko, yung matagal ko ng hinihintay. Buti na lang talaga na okay na okay yung offer sa akin. Upgrade talaga siya sa current compensation ko. I still have a long way to go, pero ganon naman diba, you really have work your way up to get better things. 

It was bittersweet, if I'm being honest, kasi I'm very close with my teammates and other officemates. Napalapit na rin ako sa kanila and ang sad lang na di ko na sila makikita everyday once I leave. Meron din akong work bestie na kasabay ko nung trainee days ko. We went through a lot together and siya talaga ang pinaka-mamimiss ko. But I have to choose myself and I will always keep choosing myself. Promise ko sa sarili ko this year na i-pprioritize ko na yung needs ko, lalong lalo na if involved ang work. If hindi ko na talaga gusto yung ginagawa ko, or toxic na talaga, I have to do something about it. So I'm really proud of myself for finally resigning because it took a lot of courage. Swerte ko lang din kasi I was able to find a new job kahit na Feb pa lang. Mahirap maghanap ng trabaho lalo na for a career shifter like me. Di rin naman ako privileged enough to resign and saka lang maghahanap ng bago. Hopefully, yung lilipatan ko magiging okay siya. It's a completely different role so I'll have to start from 0 ulit. But I do have a really good feeling about this one. Really looking forward to this new beginning. 

Just really wanted to share this big win for me! Kapagod maging corpo slave no? Gusto ko na lang maging Disney princess for real hahahaha

2024-02-22 02:50:14,Text-only,SSS Sickness Benefit Late Filing Issue,"SSS Sickness Benefit

Hello, question lang po. May issue lng po kasi ako regarding ng late filing sa sss dahil matagal na process ng accounting namin.

Bale po ganito yung timeline ng nangyari:

Dec 23: requested to bed rest dahil high-risk pregnancy. Nasubmit ko on time lahat ng requirements at na-forward ko sa HR at accounting na din. Bali 1 month bed rest yung required ko Dec 23 to Jan 19

Jan 3: dyan pa nila na notify yung sss kahit ilang beses akong nag-follow up sa kanila at nag-remind regarding na within 5 days lang dapat ang notification para hindi ma tag as ‚Äúlate filing‚Äù

Jan 19: na reject ng medical evaluation kasi dapat magsubmit ng certified true copy na ultrasound, which is hindi mn lang nag confirm yung hr or accounting na needed yun kahit tinanong ko sila ng paulit-ulit if needed ba. So ayun since na-reject, agad ko namang sinubmit yung kulang na requirements at finorward ko sa kanila. Then sa time na din nito, inextend pa din ang bed rest ko Jan 20 to Feb 19. So sinend ko nalang din yung requirements for second SN filing para isang galawan nalang.

Jan 25: dyan pa nila na notify uli sila sa first SN ko at second SN.

Feb 12: nag notify yung SSS na approve na daw for advance payment yung first SN ko, pero hindi nagbigay ng advance payment yung employer ko. Then yung second SN naman, rejected dahil hindi pa na settle yung first. So agad kong ni-notify yung hr at accounting about it when ma-reimburse yung advance payment pero walang response sa kanilang end kahit ilang follow-up na ang nangyari.

Feb 21: naka receive ako ng email ng SSS na ipa-confirm ko daw yung advance payment na na-receive (30 days count; which is wala naman talaga ni piso) at nakita kong 8 days lng yung babayran for reimbursement sa employer ko instead na 30 days dahil nga daw late nag file. Nag inquire ako nito, then sabi ng accounting na dapat ko i confirm daw para ma-receive yung reimbursement. Pero ang ending yung 8 days lng ang maibibigay dahil nga late.

Nag-reklamo ako na unfair sa part ko na mag acknowledge na naka receive nga daw ako nga advance payment (which is **,*** then yung ibibigay lng pala nila is *,*** if nag approve ako). Hindi mn lang half sa supposedly na matatanggap ko.

Ano po ba ang pwede kong gawin neto? Pwede bang mag reklamo sa sss mismo? Anong mangyayari if hindi ko i-coconfirm. Kase base lng sa email ng accounting, hindi daw i-rerelease yung payment kung di daw ako mag confirm or approve. At ang hirap pa, damay yung second SN ko dahil dito.

Kung gumagawa kayo ng LinkedIn, Jobstreet, Indeed, Glassdoor, or kung ano-ano or saan pang mga Job Hiring Site, try niyo na rin mag-effort na magbigay ng reviews, especially kung negative or bad reviews pa nga 'yan sa mga previous company niyo.

Ako kasi ginawa ko siya sa lahat ng mga previous company ko. Nilagay ko talaga yung salary ko roon, pros and cons. Napakarami sa cons talaga. Bawal company, sinabi ko talaga na yung cons and bad experiences ko. Sa good kasi, I don't know, kahit maganda yung company konti lang talaga nasabi ko kasi nga, parang yung mga magaganda na 'yon, bare minimum and common at basic naman na dapat sa isang company culture.

Masyado na kasi gasgas kung ang sasabihin ko lang *toxic management, delayed salary, no healthcard, powertripping colleagues, entitled tenured* halos lahat naman kasi may ganyan talaga. As in, sinabi ko talaga bad experiences ko sa mga department, ganito-ganyan, hindi maasahan yung department na 'to sa ganito kahit trabaho naman nila 'yon, mga ganyang bagay ba.

Nung panahong naghahanap ako ng work, as much as possible, chine-check ko talaga sa kung saan-saan makabasa lang talaga ako ng reviews sa company na binabalak ko apply-an that time.

Ako talaga, bilang ganti ko sa mga previous company ko, halos lahat may bad experiences ako, ang ginawa ko talaga sa halos lahat ng mga pwede ako magbigay ng reviews, nagbigay talaga ako. Kasi alam kong may nagbabasa talaga especially kung higher position. Pero sana kahit hindi higher, maglagay pa rin kayo.

Anonymous naman kasi tayo roon, walang makakaalam na tayo ang nagbigay ng bad feedback.

Hi. Need suggestion/s and/or advice po regarding my past job. 

So I worked as a sales in this company pero nagresign na ako last year. Ang nature of business ng company ay fabrication. What happened is after ilang months na resigned na ko, kinocontact ako ng past clients ko na may problem sa projects in which I contacted the company I used to work for but they are not offering any solution sa clients regarding sa projects na yun. Ang mali ko dito is ako yung nakapirma sa documents, kaya ako yung liable, pero yung pera na downpayment ay nakuha ng company. Now they are denying my employment and their connection sa projects na yun even though aware yung clients na nakipag transact sila sa company na yun at hindi lang sa akin. I have proofs and all pero kasi ang ginawa ko nung times na yun, inuna kong tapusin ang projects kesa sa ireklamo sila since napaka passive nila and unfair, para ma clear ang name ko. 

Sa mga lawyers po dito marami din po sana akong tanong, wala na din po kasi akong pera para kumuha ng lawyer üì∑ halos 150k+ po nagastos ko para tapusin yung projects na yun. Sana po may makapag bigay ng advice since di ko na alam gagawin ko, sobrang nakaka depress ng ganito.

I told her na I still have 5-6 days of accumulated holiday offset since October and hindi ko daw pwede yun magamit before I resign. Sobrang unfair nito sa part ko kasi I worked my ass off during those holidays and di ko naman hiningi yun. She's reiterating na pag binigay niya saken yung holiday off na yun unfair daw sa mga bago na di niya binigyan ng holiday off. I told her na resigned na ako at ano yun thank you na lang?

Like we have been down on operations since September and my job is being affected as being a data analyst, I barely or have no data to work with. The first three months after the down-time I was helping interns but the interns left and I have been doing basically nothing these past two months. I told my boss about my work but he keeps forgetting.

However that is not the problem now. The problem is that the company has been witholding everyone's 13th month pay. December pa I'm supposed to get it but it is feb and wala pa! I keep asking the operations head when activities will resume and he still said ""Hindi ko alam"". i asked the HR head about the 13th month pay and she still said ""Wala pa"". At this point I am job hunting because I just hate how bad the management is in the down-time. I gets na every manufacturer can have periods of inactivity and dormancy pero I imagined it only to last for 2 months, NOT 5 MONTHS AND ONGOING! PLUS NO 13th MONTH PAY PA! EHH WHAT IF I WANT TO RESIGN!

Now the reason I am doubtful of reporting this to DOLE is because, I got this job through my dad's friend. There was a time I thought I would get delayed in University due to thesis and I did not want one subject to deny me entry to the workforce (I mean having white collared jobs with a degree required). I decided to ask my dad if he has friends to give me an entry-level job despite me still being a student. He used his networking and he found a friend of his who has a manufacturing company and I just got a job there. I managed to graduate naman pero I feel that utang ng loob mentality because I did not get the job through normal means.

Or any type of leave po, possible na bigyan ka ng warning letter. And kapag po nagkaroon ka ng 5 warning letter sa loob ng isang taon, for termination na po. So last year, etong kaibigan ko po nagkaroon po siya ng 4 na warning letter, nagexpect po siya macclear na siya for this year. This month po bigla pong sinabi na hindi marerefresh ung number of offense niya. Sa tagal po ng stay namin sa company ngayon lang po nangyari to. Ang pagkakaalam ko din po kasi kahit sa mga previous work ko, macclear ung number of offense mo per year pero hindi siya mawawala sa record mo. Pero kung sakali na magkaroon ka ng offense pag tapak ng panibagong taon magiging 1st warnig na lang ulit siya.

Work is becoming too repetitive and it's showing on my performance that they may get stricter on me. I desperately want to resign na agad but I made a mistake of not putting any upskill the past year, so I don't know where to go. I can't resign din agad since I'm the breadwinner and none of my family are employed.

I know there's no choice but I have to grit my teeth, but is there a routine you guys do juggling burnout/mental health issues, upskilling, and enduring work in the meantime? Any good career options that an introvert can pick up?

2024-02-19 23:21:36,Text-only,Am I been sabotaged at work,"little bit fresh grad with previous wotking experiences. I want to post again regarding my stay at this recent company. I was not regularized in a chinese company that I was working with for less than 3 months. Since then, my boss didn't message nor told me of what am I going to do. Never messaged me directly even telling about my performance before my supposedly end of my probation. His other assistant (who also happened to evaluated me, never told me before the end of my contract regarding my poor performance. She seems like didn't me as important as other people. She also seems to indirectly participate on those people who give me back handed compliments and insults as they treat it as a joke. I've never been in a proper training wherein the boss or co workers will teach me the step by step process and what are the purpose of each files. I just able to know things when I asked. But some people doesn't like being asked a few more times. 

When I was leaving the company, people seems to joke about my farewell. It's really insulting. 

As a person who had been partially diagnosed with mental disorder, I needed to know things first before knwing the flow of the task as I am meticulous. But what happened is people don't like being being bothered  in a place that I don't know what to do. I also decide on own if ever that they dont respond to me, but when things go wrong. They are always there to criticize me. I'm assesing things na kulang sa akin when I am creating mistakes and what are the causes of those mistakes. I always smile and trying my best to understand each person at work but I'm still getting hurt by them. Tried to ask one of them but told me that I'm weird because I ask a lot when on the first place they didn't explain to me further. Chinese people also have been very bad nung pinahiya nila ako nung di ko alam na yung task is out of my skills already and when I am just clarifying htings like meeting since we dont have domain.

It is really hard to paper trail everything as the company doesn't have domain.

Right before my last day. They told that there is no need for turn over as they have been told by the boss that it is what is. Then, they suddenly told me why I didn't submit my files and might hold the last pay. 

I am still thankful for the people who secretly supported me at work. I'm guilty as I'm not able to say proper thank you once again.

What are your thoughts and advices. Thank you. 

Also please help me of what am I going to explain to employers about my forced resignation. Thank you.",0,6,0.38,Advice Needed ü§î,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/1aupsct/am_i_been_sabotaged_at_work/,1aupsct

I work for a big and known corporation and it‚Äôs sooo toxic there! The culture stems from the upper management kaya it‚Äôs hard to do something about it. Borderline abusive ang mga bosses, no boundaries na on weekends you are expected to work and reply to their messages. There was an instance na nag-email at 9pm and requesting for a meeting asap over something na hindi naman urgent. So much politics too to the point na hindi mo matanggihan work na hindi pasok sa JD mo because mapapaginitan ka talaga. 4-5 months pa lang ako sa company and yet there‚Äôs so much damage done to my mental health kaya immediate resignation ako, backed by a medical certificate from my psychiatrist since I was also diagnosed with anxiety triggered by work. It‚Äôs sooo not worth my mental health to stay there despite the good compensation package, I dread going to work daily because of the people and environment there. Thankful rin ako sa privilege ko na I have enough savings to support me and my family for the next 2-3 months while I‚Äôm taking a break so I can recover.

Health is wealth talaga. Now I know better than magtiis sa mga companies na di marunong rumespeto sa mga empleyado.

Here are the key factors sa pagreresign ko

Trainer: Well wala naman akong problema sa trainer ko pero lagi nalang ako pinag-iinitan kapag nakakagawa ng simple pagkakamali, parang nagiging micro- manager. Minsan hindi nga maayos magturo (Honestly). Parang ako lang lagi pinagtataniman ng galit pero pag sa iba naman siya magalit, may pang-unawa or binebaby sila knowing na bago kaming lahat at ako lang nakakaranas ng ganon. Ginagamit niya pang excuse yung pagiging prangka niya pero may borderline bullying and discrimination na yung ginagawa niya.   


Supervisor: May supervisor talaga na mahilig mang-power trip pero buti nalang umalis na rin sila pero hindi namin maiwasan may maiiwan na ayaw namin talaga. Nalaman ko rin na yung isang supervisor namin ay may kapit or protected from upper management kaya kahit ipaglaban mo or I- call out pagkakamali ng supervisor, sumbong kaagad sa upper management. Minsan bully rin ibang yan pero hindi ko nalang pinapansin.  


Overwork- Halos everyday na nangyari sa akin yan. Kahit nung first day ko, OT agad ako kasi walang papalit sa akin. Minsan pa nga mahigit 12 hours ako sa trabaho and kinukulit nila ako na mataas nanaman sahod ko (Sa totoo lang, nakakairita at umay pakinggan mga salitang yan.)

2024-02-17 05:21:37,Text-only,I can't wait to resign,"Long post ahead, sobrang gigil lang ako talaga. 

I do not work for a BPO, but I do work in a contact center for a local bank. I've been on the post for more than a year, and honestly, I want to fucking leave. Naghahanap naman na ako ng malilipatan, it just so happens na di ako makapag-pasa since I'm still waiting on a good offer. The bills ain't paying themselves at walang generational wealth ang family ko for me to resign ng wala pang new work.

It used to be okay naman. Tbh, I really do not like taking calls. I freaking hate what I do. But for experience and to keep myself afloat, I took the offer kasi desperado na ako. When I was looking for jobs nung 2022, ito lang yung tumanggap sa akin and mababait kasi yung managers ko during my interview. Hindi ko na kayang ma-tengga any longer so I took the risk and accepted the offer kahit na sobrang baba nung basic. Nakakabawi lang because maganda benefits nung bank, but even so, sobrang underpaid namin. 

We're open 24/7, kahit na wala namang international clients masyado tapos shifting sched pa. Nag-gy na ako so I know na ang unnecessary ng gy shift kasi legit na ilang piraso lang tumatawag and yung mga concerns ng clients pwede namang makapaghintay by the morning. Tapos nagdagdag pa sila ng 6am to 3pm at 4pm to 1am ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Before, mahirap na mag-file ng leaves. If meron kang kasama na di makakapasok, they have to look for someone to cover that person's shift. Tapos may policy rin na if nag-SL ka you have to work on a rest day to make up for it. Like I said, di kami BPO, pero it feels like that. Not entirely sure kung ganito rin sa BPO, so don't come for me.

Before 2023 ended, they hired this new officer. Hindi pa siya nakakapasok, nagsisimula na magbago yung ihip ng hangin. Dami na agad changes sa house rules na sobrang wala namang sense. Clean desk policy kuno pero yung mga officers ang daming gamit sa table. Yung mga may pedestal bawal itabi sa kanila, officers lang pwede. Tapos manda OT every fucking week. Ang bilis bilis magpa-OT, pero ang damot damot magpa-leave at SL. We have a target kasi na we have to meet at least 80% answer level every day para makapasa kami end of month. What can we do? Wala pa kaming 30 na agents overall. Sa isang araw wala pa ata kaming 15 na nag-ccalls. Paano namin aabutin yung desired AL kung kulang kami sa tao? OT daw sagot nila eh kahit naman mag-OT kaming lahat sa isang araw, di talaga kaya yon. Dumadami na yung clients ng bank pero kami ganon pa rin. Nag-hhire naman daw sila pero pa-isa isa lang. Paano, ang baba ng offer. Tatanggapin mo lang yun if sobrang desperado mong kumita ng pera like me. Nasilaw kasi ako doon sa 16 mos namin lol pero kulang na kulang pa rin talaga. 

I am writing this post kasi sobrang sama ng loob ko. Bigla akong nagsuka kahapon and nagtae (TMI). I really don't know why kasi okay naman ako before coming to work. We have this break sched na we strictly have to follow, kasi if hindi i-ccrucify ka nila (joke lang). So my shift yesterday was from 10 am to 7pm. Lunch ko was at 2pm. Before ako magpa-init ng food ko, I had to do number 2, so I already knew something was off tapos bigla akong nawalan ng gana. It could have been because of something I ate pero wala naman kasi akong kinain na foreign sa akin. After forcing myself to finish my baon, I went to the comfort room and sinuka ko lahat ng kinain ko. I immediately advised my TL na di ako okay and if pwede bang umuwi na lang muna ako. He told me to go to the clinic first and ask for meds. So I did, and sabi nung doctor baka raw acid reflux so they gave me meds for that. I went back to the cr and nagsuka na naman ako and number 2. It was much worse this time. Ininom ko na yung mga gamot after doing my thing and messaged my TL again, telling him na hindi ko na talaga kaya. When I got back sa station ko, di muna ako nag-in agad kasi I was waiting for them to tell me if uuwi na ba ako or not. They were interviewing someone kaya natagalan, so nairita ako, nag-calls muna ako. Tas sobrang bad trip ko na kasi it's not my fault na bigla akong nagsusuka. Hindi ko rin naman kasalanan na sumama ang pakiramdam ko?

I rarely take absences even when I was a student kasi wala namang reason for me to be absent. Nung gs and hs ako, perfect attendance ako lagi. As in isang school year di ako nag-aabsent unless need na need talaga. I come to work on time pero for them late na yon kasi dapat at least 30 minutes before ng shift mo nandoon ka na. I am working on it. Lagi akong pumapasok, kahit na medyo di ako okay, pumapasok ako. 

Going back, after their interview, nag-reply na yung tl ko na nag-clinic na raw ba ako. Nakakaloka!!! Tapos sinabihan ako na mag rest muna tas balik ako after an hour. Sabi ko titiisin ko na lang kasi anong oras na non. But they insisted na mag-stop muna ako mag-calls since they were already asking approval from the new annoying boss kung pwede ba akong pauwiin. So nandoon ako sa likod ng office nagpapahinga. After 10-15 minutes lumapit yung TL ko at pinapauwi na ako kasi baka raw today ako hindi makapasok. Concern nila yung AL kasi weekend so critical. Mas inuna pa yung AL kesa sa health ko, okay sige. So di na ako nagpatumpik tumpik pa, bumalik ako sa station ko at nag-log out na ako at umuwi. Ang sama pa ng tingin nung inbound head namin na akala mo pumatay ako. Pero pag sila yung di okay, onting kibot lang leave agad. Fucking bullshit. 

So I booked my Move It and habang nasa daan, nasusuka na naman ako ulit. Sabi ko buti na lang pala umuwi ako. Di ko pala siya kayang tiisin. When I got home, it was a complete disaster. Tapos I started getting mild fever at sobrang awful talaga ng pakiramdam ko. I didn't want to eat anything kasi I lost my appetite and sure ako na isusuka ko lang din lahat. Tubig, gatorade, onting lugaw, at gamot lang laman ng tiyan ko. Nagsabi na ako last night na baka di ako makapasok kasi ang sama pa rin talaga ng pakiramdam ko and I'll observe muna if kaya ko pumasok the next day (which is today)

I woke up around 4am at nagsuka na naman ako. Pag-check kong phone ko, nag-reply na pala yung TL ko at parang kasalanan ko talaga na di ako okay. Kaya raw pinayagan ako umuwi kahapon para makapasok ako today. Ay sorry naman po at di ako si Superman na kryptonite lang ang weakness. Pasensya naman at inuuna ko lang ang health ko na karapatan ko namang di pumasok kahit pa na RD ko tom hanggang monday. Eh di ko talaga kaya pumasok? Para saan pa yung sl credits ko? Decoration? Puta lang üòÖ send ko kaya sa kanila picture ng suka ko. 

I'll end it here. Nakakainis sobra. If you made it this far, thanks for taking the time to read. Sana talaga makahanap na akong better offer para masampal ko na sa mga pagmumukha nila resignation ko. Ang babasura ng mga ugali nila doon. Walang consideration sa mga employees nila eh kami yung bumubuhay sa unit na yon.

I consulted with a psychiatrist, and prescribed a medicine for my case. Akala ko ok na ako, nakakabond na ako with my workmates. Pero weeks after that, nabalik na naman sa dati, tumaas yung dosage ng gamot ko. Instead na nababawasan, nadadagdagan. Until nagkaron ng confrontation with me and my immediate supervisor.

2024-02-15 20:22:54,Text-only,Amendments to existing contract?,"Hi AntiworkPH!

We are currently having issues with our company regarding our working hours. We have yet to discuss it further with the management so we are refraining from reaching out to DOLE. But I just want to gather insights from anyone who has knowledge about it.

So our contract states that schedule of work is 48 hours but general schedule of work is monday to friday, 8 hours a day. So it sums up to 40 hours a week only. Our understanding was that we may be required to work overtime up to 48 hours if needed due to the nature of our work, but our understanding is that it would be paid overtime.

The company is now arguing that per the employee handbook, our work schedule is 48 hours a week, 6 days a week. So up until the 48 hours weekly, we are not entitled to overtime pay. Which contradicts the schedule in our contract.

Now they said that they have made an error in the contract and they would amend it to reflect the work schedule in the handbook.

By the way, they had us sign an acknowledgment for the handbook, said acknowledgement includes a clause that it may be changed from time to time at the company's discretion with or without notice to us.

Is this clause allowed? Given that they are claiming that the work schedule in the handbook should be followed instead of the contract? So what prevents them from claiming that other clauses in the handbook would prevail over the contract, and that they can make changes to the handbook anytime?

Another thing is, if they do provide a new contract and I refuse to sign it, what would happen to me? Would I be forced to resign? Should I immediately stop work if I don't agree to the new terms since they migjt argue that since I am continuing to work, I am agreeing to the new terms?

Almost 11 years na ako dito sa company ko and hindi sila transparent sa bereavement beneficiary. As far as ai can remember, one time lang sila nagpost ng mga beneficiaries ilang beses na natanong sa townhall meetings. Tas ngayon wala na uli. Kapag nauungkat ang sinasabi lang ng HR ay ‚Äúhindi naman pwede idisclose‚Äù and ‚Äúdi kaya ng konsensya ko iexploit(not the exact term pero parang ganto) na ilabas ang names ng mga namatayan‚Äù na parang what, anong masama dun? Fact yun tsaka mas malalaman ng empleyado kung sino ang dadamayan or para mas makapagabot ng mas malaking tulong. 

Ang kaltas samin ay 25 pesos per cut off. Minsan 20 lang, and mabibilang sa daliri yung wala talaga. This is mandatory contribution. According sa kanila, 5pesos per beneficiary daw and ang makakareceive ay ung namatayan ng immediate family(mukang strict sila dito kasi may kakilala ako di nabigyan kahit lola nya yung namatay). 

2022 or 2023 ginamit pa nila ang pandemic na kesyo madami daw namatay. Di ko alam kung may backlogs sila ng mga nagapply ng benefit pero paano yung pre pandemic? Ano dahilan nila dun? Ang issue ko dito is yung transparency. Sakin walang issue kahit 10/15 pa per head ang bawas para sa namatayan pero sana transparent. i believe na kahit cents lang ang binabawas mo dapat transparent ka sa mga tao mo.

2024-02-14 17:51:49,Text-only,Vacation Leave Cash Conversion Dispute After Resignation,"Hello mga master, I need advise lang regarding VL cash conversion dispute with my former employer.

&#x200B;

**Background:** We have annual Vacation Leaves of 15 days. For 2023, I only took 1 day VL. So I have remaining 14 days VL. I resigned from the company last Jan. 12, 2024.

**Issue:** Upon checking my last pay calculation, the VLs converted to cash were only 7.99 days. Saan yung remaining 7 days VL?

**HR Explanation: ""**Since you left the company January 12, 2024, company policy for the carry forward leaves and leave encashment shall apply. You have 15 days entitlement, so half of that 15 days shall be encashed (in your final pay) and the remaining shall be carried forward to next year, since merck does not encash carry forward leave it will be forfeited.""

**HR Article regarding VL:** 

https://preview.redd.it/4q2bsomkviic1.png?width=1191&format=png&auto=webp&s=58224d14a47361a24799aacb047b3db4f2b6b27f

In my point of view, magkabukod ang dalawang point ""**Non-usage of all VL credits**"" and ""**Employee Separation from the Company**"". So in my understanding, sa clause under ""Employee Separation from the Company"" applicable sakin since ako ay resign na, nabanggit na accumulated and unused vacation leave will be converted to cash.

Tanong ko lang, is valid argument ba yung niri-raise ko sa HR? May habol ba ako dito? Saang agency ako pwedeng lumapit para magcomplain regarding dito?

Thanks in Advance sa mga sasagot. God Bless.

2024-02-13 07:25:42,Text-only,Effect of salary increase on COE prior to contract bond completion,"Sorry sa title, parang naging research paper HAHAHA


Hi to everyone! I'd like your opinions or insights on this. 

Let's say me and my colleagues are project-based employees in a known construction company. The thing is, we have a contract bond for two years in the company, with each of us having differing end dates (within a 6-month range).

Within these two years, may salary increase lang 'yung iba na about 5k (18 to 23) and 'yung iba 2k (23 to 25) within the first year. Those na 18k starting were fresh graduates or first job whereas 'yung mga 23k already had about 1 to 2 years exp prior to entering the company.

Our immediate superior mentioned before that our contracts were planned to be aligned to about 27k before our bond ends, and aabot lang ng 30k pagkapirma ng contract extension. This was the plan. Recently, our superior announced that only one appraisal per year was allowed (kahit siya naman yung nagdelay ng pag-asikaso ng papers namin for increase) and that the resolution with our CompBen HR was that wala na ang alignment for 27k and ""awaiting for signing"" na daw ang 30k at the end of our contract para sa extension papers.

Fellow colleagues also planned to leave the company mostly because of this reason (delay or miniscule amounts of increase due to our superior). Our job has a common 35k starting in other companies and hindi pa naman siya saturated so we assume that we are not being paid fairly compared to other companies. Even more disappointing is the fact that other teams in our department  already had their increase maxed out to 30k after their first year due to their respective team leads, which made us distrust our superior more.

So our question is, in the case na lumipat sila ng ibang company, will the COE be a critical document in salary negotiation? Due to the arrangement ng HR namin, it seems na parang gusto niya na ""wala kaming history na more than 25k sahod namin"" after our 2 year stint. Kung tatanungin, baka pagbasehan ang indicated salary namin sa COE for the offer and may be a basis for lowballing.

Will edit the post in case more info is needed. Please feel free to share more insights as well since we're not much aware of how HR and negotiation works (just like our current job na nauna work bago contract and JO haha).

Ventilus Castelus

Klepac - Liham 02

Sa araw-araw na buhay ko, tingin ko sa mga tao, parang mga normal na maskara lang. Iba-iba ang hitsura. May masaya, may malungkot, may dismayado, iba-iba. Kahit sa mga araw na nagtatrabaho ako, parang nawalan lang ako ng gana na makialam pa sa mga kung anuman ang nararamdaman ng mga yan. Opi√±on ko lang, ang boring. Siguro, mukang sarili ko lang ata ang matuturingan kong ‚Äúbest friend‚Äù sa panahon ngayon.

Minsan, nag-try na din akong makisama. Ayos at normal naman sa una, pero nang tumagal, mukang obvious na sakin ang mga dillema ng mga taong napapakisamahan ko, yung bang may alam na ‚Äúreal talk‚Äù for me, pero, nag-decide na lang na ‚Äúayawan‚Äù nalang ako, para sa so-called status quo na puno lang naman ng mga ka-bullshit-an nila. Introvert ako, kaya ko yon nalaman. Kahit implication at insinuation, nagagawa kong ma-anticipate, siguro, dahil sa long-time exposure ko sa betrayal tsaka sa disappointment ko, na naging real talk na sa mga mata ko. Aminado ako, nakaka-putang-ina lang talaga ang buhay on the time of this writing.

At times, kapag may mga ginagawa ako, sayang-sayang ako na somehow, independent akong magtrabaho. Kaso, may mga tao kasi na sadyang mga ‚Äútry-hard advocate‚Äù sa so-called family work culture na sa suspetsa ko, yung bang, psychologically, gumagamit ng mga altruistic and collective concepts na dapat, ‚Äúlahat tayo, pamilya dito‚Äù, ‚Äúdapat, makisama ka‚Äù, ‚Äúbarkada ang turingan dito‚Äù, mga iba pang bullshit na pang-crowd-controlling, na ginagawa nang propagandistic! Subconsciously, eto ang nalalaman ko, tsaka, di naman ibig sabihin na evident to, for the least, na base lang to sa real-life experience ko. Ang babaw lang isipin na, sa speculation ko, mukang isang tool ang family work culture, like, ano to, katulad sa Japanese work culture na dapat maging ‚Äútapat‚Äù sa trabaho, most of the time, bilang respeto sa mga katrabaho pati mga boss? What the fuck‚Äôs going on? Baka tatanggapin ko pa yun kung ang magiging sweldo ko, is kayang mai-reciprocate ang effort ko, yung to the point na, masa-satisfy ang daily essential ko sa minimalistic kong lifestyle. Anyways, ano ba ang halaga ng family work culture kung lahat ng mga empleyado at ako, nagtatrabaho, for self-interest, di ba? Ang irony kasi dito, is, karamihan, nagsasama-sama para makinabang sila sa reward ng mga effort nila, na dapat kung may mapapala at napapala sila, go lang, otherwise, out na. No hard feelings.

Sa ibang pangyayari ng buhay ko, kailangan ko tuloy na mag-isip kung ano bang klaseng mga tao ba ang sadyang mapagkakatiwalaan na pwede kong gawing kakampi sa long-term life progression ko, pero sa ngayon, mukang hindi ako confident na sabihin ko na di sila maaasahan, lalo na sa panahon ngayon na karamihan, may pangagailangan na, by hook, or by crook. It‚Äôs a ‚Äúdoggie-dog world‚Äù ba naman, walang dala-dalawa, na magbabanat ng buto, makaraos lang. Sakin, todo tuloy lang pa rin, kahit kumakapit sa kokote ko ang mala-putang-inang negativity na gusto kong maialis, pero, you know what? I decide to to keep these, not into detriment, but to my fortitude. Syempre, laging vibrated ang kokote ko sa frustration, talagang magpapakatatag na lang ako para matupad ko anuman ang gusto ko. Ang iba, baka mag-isip na, ‚Äúdapat, magpakukumbaba ako‚Äù, ‚Äúdapat, wag mangontra kung di naman kailangan‚Äù, ‚Äúdapat, wag maging solo‚Äù, pero sakin, relevant ba na maniwala ako? I don‚Äôt think so. Ano ba ang benefit ng mga ‚Äúslogan‚Äù na yan sakin kung ang isang nakakataas, yung lang ang makikinabang the most? Siguro, economically, mag-i-improve ang stability ng kumpanya, pero, sa laylayan, na anjan ako, konti lang, kung tutuusin.

Di na ko nagulat kase marami siyang issues na sinisita sa akin dahil panay sulsol isa kong co-worker na mahilig mamulis. Di ko pa natitingnan sa handbook namin if may AWOL/AWOP cases ba talaga for memo or dinagdag lang nila yung AWOP kasi dinisapprove.

Considered ba talaga na AWOL yung 1 day na leave ko na dinisapprove? Or pwede ko siyang iligay na isa sa dahilan ko na constructive dismissal sa ipapasa kong resignation letter?

2024-02-09 18:37:52,Text-only,Intrusive tracking software in company device,"Hi, my co-workers and I (working for an American company, WFH) discovered that there's an activity and location-tracking software installed in our company-issued laptop.

I won't mention the name of the software to protect our identity, but we did some research and learned that such software can take screenshots and photos of us (thru the laptop's main camera) without us knowing. This software can also track our location.

We were not informed at all about this software when our laptop was given to us and I was wondering if you think its a good idea to bring this up with HR and/or concerned agencies (we have a few in mind that can help us)? 

While we understand that we're using company-issued devices but still, such devices are being used in our private spaces (i.e. our homes). And knowing what the software can do --- especially yung part na it takes photos of us without us knowing, sobrang creepy talaga. A coworker also mentioned that she worked in another company before and she was informed  beforehand that there's an activity-tracking software in their company-issued laptop, so at least she's aware.

However, in our case, we weren't informed at all. Do you think may laban kami? Is it just reasonable to call out the management regarding this?

HR has advised me that the Feb 29, 2024 last date is because we follow the working week not calendar week. Anyone could give me more clarity regarding this?

----------------


Hi everyone. So a bit of a background, I have sent mg resignation notice last Jan 30, 2024 (tuesday) with a notice period of 4 weeks as per my contract, therefore my last day would be on Feb 27, 2024.


I have sent my notice via email to my immediate supervisor and I cc'd our Senior Ops Manager and Director. However our Senior Ops Manager only acknowledged my email on Thursday, Feb 1, 2024. Our SOM then setup a 1:1 to discuss the resignation the day after, Friday Feb 2. However it was moved to yesterday, Monday Feb 5. Then again moved to today, Feb 6.

Now, upon our 1:1, our SOM insists that my render period will only start WHEN they approved my resignation (which I know is not true), and would effectively move my effective final day.

Question 1. since I know that as per law, the minimum notice period should be 30 days, magtetake affect pa rin ba yung notice ko na 4 weeks (28 days) even though as per law minimum dapat ay 30?

Question 2. Anong pwede kong gawin sakaling ipilit nila yung ""kailangan iaccept yung resignation bago tumakbo yung 30 day"" especially since they delayed the acknowledgement and  1:1 to effectively start the render period?",8,19,0.84,Advice Needed ü§î,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/1akgs5f/resignation_acceptance/,1akgs5f

2024-02-06 18:24:48,Text-only,Waste of time onsite invitation to their office [interview process],"So I applied for this one well known optical/eye wear company since my first impression of them is that they seem ""progressive"" since their owners are millenials. Then, I was invited for an initial interview with HR , seems okay, then I was invited to have an interview with the Hiring Manager.. (this is where the red flags begin to appear), Hiring Manager wasn't able to interview me due to a ongoing meeting, but HR should have been able to inform me, I am okay to wait for 30 minutes if ever, am also okay to be rescheduled, but no! I WAITED FOR 2 HOURS before the HR said that the interview will be rescheduled. Wasted time is wasted money since i filed a half day to really invest my focus and time on this company. After a few weeks, I was rescheduled (finally!), so far the waiting time shortened from 2 hours to almost an hour only. I was underwhelmed by the questions of the hiring manager, I was expecting more in depth questions so I can showcase my experience. Thankfully I was invited to their office for a final interview. Here goes the waiting game again, 30-45minutes in the lobby, 1-2 hours waiting for someone to fetch me in their conference area, then I was interviewed again by someone in HR, after that, they were waiting for the Hiring Manager's update if there's anything else I should meet or do, so I waited and waited and lunch time came, there were no more interviews! üò™ then the HR said that I was free to stay but as of that moment, i respectfully declined their offer and requested if there's anything I need to do/meet before I go home. There was so much time wasted already, I was expecting something productive since I filed a leave again to attend this onsite shit. Fast forward to today (after a month and half) I was informed that I wasn't shortlisted ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π

I am really angry on how they don't respect one's time. I understand that people really need to invest time and money to attend onsite interview, but if your process if inefficient, better remove those onsite shit and postpone interviews if you have meetings. Anong sible ng calendar management. Sayang ang sahod at leave sainyo. I guess I dodged a bullet nadin, I saw some negative reviews in glassdoor specially for that department i wanted to apply to. 

Weird part: Hiring Manager asked me if I applied before, I said yes, (i really wanted to join their company), Hiring Manager asked for the name of the person that interviewed me, i said that i forgot, he told me that it's fine since that the person probably resigned, most of the people have resigned on that department and hiring manager just joined last year. Stalked their LinkedIn as well, and it showed that almost all of the people in their team were recently hired as well. Hmmm something's fishy ü§î

I work in a big chinese construction firm wherein we handle biddings. I am determined to know everything from processing documents to the structure of the company. While working on this company, I was really challenged to build the puzzle piece by piece because of lack of proper briefing. I was able to ask questions but the thing was, how can I ask certain questions if I don't know the gap. So much processes to the point that I always ask myself on what should I do first and that. So in the end, I'm so confused on what to do.

Aside from that, some people are not really accomodating to questions and sometimes regarded as ""makulit"" even if I just want specific clarification after a research so I became so anxious to ask questions. Also, we don't have domain for documented email communication and use an app for delegation of stuffs. I really do think that It is one of the factor.

So let's get to the bottom line. I don't know where to start. I just really want to cry and I really don't know how to apply to the next compnay without any hassle. Feeling so incompetent and I don't know where to go now since I don't have enough fund to rent a place . Feeling like a piece of crap. I don't know if someone will hire me on the next company. I'm good at other things it's just that it is really  hard to get a job nowadays that's why  I took this opportunity rightaway.

2024-02-04 20:39:57,Text-only,Villar companies have no contract,"Parang wala ako makita na reddit post about villar companies in general. Pero alam niyo ba na walang contracts ang mga employees under the Villar group?

This includes companies such as Vistamall, Stamall, AllDay/AllHome/AllShoppe,  Planet, StreamTech, MGS Construction, Camella, Bria, Lumina, Vistaland, Prime Asset Ventures, Kratos, SI Power, Primewater,  etc

Andami niyang companies! And sa lahat ng kakilala ko, lahat sila walang contract! (Actually di ko sure kung lahat ng nalista ko sa taas ay wala, pero more than half niyan sure ako)

Tbh nagulat ako nung nag-apply ako at natanggap naman ako agad. Nakakairita pa HR sa company ko diyan, kasi bigla bigla sila magpainterview at exam. Tipong today tatawag tapos gusto bukas agad interview na. At magugulat ka na lang pagfinal interview mo na wala palang contract contract. Lahat ng pag-uusapan niyo verbal lang, walang written shit. Sa part ko ok naman un kasi nilayasan ko sila agad nang walang pakundangan. 15 days nga lang nirender ko kasi tulong sa team ko, pero I would have left immediately kung di lang ako concerned sa kanila.

With regard sa exp sa management, ok naman ung iba, pero ung iba toxic din. Parang different cogs of a machine kayo pero ung ibang parts kasi sablay kaya di rin kayo makapagfunction nang maayos. HAHA. And ang pangit lang na hindi streamlined iyong mga pwedeng istreamline na processes kaya ang kalat ng documents nila and even their books. Haha. Funny lang na sa dami ng gusto nilang mangyari hindi man lang nila malaman ano kailangan nila para maging efficient. 

Siguro kaya rin mahal magbenta ng products mga Villar groups kahit hindi naman talaga at par ung quality sa cost ng pricing nila? Marami kasing sinusunog para sa wala, so para maoffset ay mahal ang products. Malaki ang percentage ng costing sa risk? 

Medyo mataas din turnover rate sa company namin, and I think sa ibang villar companies din based sa alam ko. Ung sakin kasi personal reason. Pero mas marami talagang opportunities na mas maganda kasi compared sa kanila. I guess marami lang nagiistay dahil convenient?

Pero go gawin niyong stepping stone yan if you really need work. Parang madali naman makapasok pero initial screening sa amin dati ay logic math english din talaga muna. Doon maraming naligwak. 

Anyway ayun basically nagulat lang ako wala pa atang nagpost regarding this. Ang concerning kaya na wala kayong contract?

2024-02-05 12:05:37,Text-only,Work from other dept.,"Hi! I just need to have your opinion on this. I‚Äôm not even sure if this is the right sub to post this. So context is bigla akong cinall out ng colleague ko from other dept kung bakit trinansfer ko ung call rather than actioning it.

Si colleague ko is from Dept B while Im from Dept A. Our departments are under 1 umbrella which means that we work close together.

A year or two ago kasi, si Dept B need ng help from Dept A because they have a goal/target/project na ma collect ang info ng accounts/clients nila and that they had a deadline. So kami from Dept A, we helped the Dept B for that certain period of time kasi sobrang dami rin naman tlga ng accounts na yun. Pag nag callback ung tinawagan nila, we just have to get the information we needed. They were able to reach the goal naman sa deadline nila. Like what I mentioned earlier, it was around a year or two ago. The project is still ongoing pero hindi na siya ganun ka dami and urgent and we from Dept A hindi narin masyado nag hehelp to this specific process nila. 

Now, everytime na maka receive ako ng call for Dept B for this certain process, trinatransfer ko sa kanila kasi in the first place, this is not our process and not my job naman tlga. And tapos naman na din ung time na nagprovide kami ng help sa kanila.

I had 2 calls earlier returning the missed call from Dept B. So I transferred all of them to them. Then nag chat nalang ung colleague ko sa GC namin na if I could assist nalang sana yung ganung process, it would be a big help sa kanila. 

Wala naman problem kung mag hehelp ako pero kasi alam nyo yun, hindi naman yan part ng job ko. It‚Äôs an additional task saken (though konti lang nmn task ko). Siguro may hugot lang tlga ako dito kasi ive done a lot na sa dept namin and wala masyadong recognition and now if I continue helping the other dept, what benefit ang makukuha ko dito. Wala naman. 

I would like to seek some advice kung pano ko to i-raise sa mga managers and teams ko and ma relay ko sa kanila ng tama yung nararamdaman ko. Thanks.",0,1,0.33,Advice Needed ü§î,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/1aj7hwz/work_from_other_dept/,1aj7hwz

I'm a CSR and never climbed the corporate ladder since I don't have that much needs aside the bills and life insurance I am paying monthly. 

Recently I have been moved to another project and I have been working with this project just fine for a year now but my new bosses keeps finding new issues with my ""work ethics"" per say. Recently clashed with a co-worker due to a difficult problem and customer and I was threatened that I will be sent to HR. Which rubbed me the wrong way as I have never experienced in this company for 5 years and other companies that I have been with. I also have been under multiple bosses and projects before.

This new project makes me wanna rip my hair out since the client is difficult to work with and I there are always constant threats from my boss that "" do x and get fired. "" ""You don't wanna be the last guy I forced to leave this company"". And It's getting too toxic for me. 

However, I love the remote setup, never need to go to the office and I am properly compensated. I also have a great work-life balance because of the work from home setup.

Nakakainis lang na it really is time to go pero wala akong choice but to stay kasi wala akong malipatan na mas matino. Kung baga, this is the lesser evil choice kaya kailangan ko magtiis kahit ang ewan na ng situation. 

1. Underpaid. I am not paid my market value. Nalowball ako for the own desire na makapasok sa gaming industry. I‚Äôm not the only one.

3. People are convinced na the company is the standard for high salary base rates for artists ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî pero see #1 and #2

4. Pag nag resign ka, ‚Äúhindi ka na family‚Äù so wala na sila pake sayo afterwards.

6. Marami ring issues within the core people ng business ‚Äî‚Äî magaling lang mag sweep under the rug yung higher management sa issues at mabilis rin kasi mag convince sa mga tao na everything is fine and dandy kahit hindi.

Kahit anong reach out mo talaga, mag-ignore talaga noh?

Kaya I keep tabs on those companies na NR when it comes to follow-up and even add glassdoor review sa recruitment process nila.

Nakakafrustrate talaga. Nawawalan na ako ng pag-asa dito magwork ng maayos. Sobrang daming pinapagawa na recordings/exam/interviews at kung anu-ano tapos mumultuhin ka lang. Ganito na ba kabastos ang recruitment sector?  I have other applications pero lowball naman based on conversation.

2024-02-01 14:39:50,Text-only,Abusive Business Partner,"Not sure if this is the right sub pero let me just share this experience with my business partner, the reason I pulled out my investment as well.

I'm no biggie in business pero I run multiple (bigasan, food franchises, small carwash, village parking space and Airbnb in surf area up north), yung iba dyan I owned talaga, others are shared businesses. I still work as a fulltime in a digital agency kasi alipin pa rin tayo ng salapi and I've been in the office since 2015 din and okay naman sya.

Since kilala naman ako ng mga colleagues ko about my businesses, this young colleague and hinawakan ko rin sya before, approached me to asked about starting a small business, so I asked ano business and assess kung ano ba knowledge nya sa papasukin nya. He'll be partnered daw by his mom and girlfriend so I thought okay sya. The way he tells me his plans was good so I offered to give him free consultancy and coaching sa business. Then I told him may new business ako na nakuha (refreshment drinks) baka pwede makiplace in tapos hati na lang sa kita. It run smoothly ng mga 5 months na and my sales are good din. Although the main business is slowly progressing, pero ups naman sya. I decided to invest na rin sa negosyo nya, ako nagayos ng inventory system tapos ako naghanap ng mga direct suppliers na mas mura talaga and also pag may mga meeting ako, nagdadala ako ng products namin to offer as free taste or minsan binibenta ko sa clients haha.

Pero 1 thing I notice bakit mabagal ang sales nila before is papalit palit yung empleyado and laging nagsasara kasi wala raw tatao. I asked him about the employees kasi on paper parang well compensated naman, sa viber chats sobrang okay naman sila makipagusap pero sabi nya ang aarte daw kasi nila. So I offered my help and called my batchmate sa school na looking for work, sa carwash ko talaga sya ilalagay pero nakiusap ako na baka pwede dun muna sa sa store na isa, luckily parang 20 mins away lang sya sa location mas malapit sya actually than my carwash. So at first month okay din ang feedback ni batchmate pero hindi sa colleague ko but to his gf and mom. Marunong daw makisama and natuturuan, pero pag si colleague tinatanong ko sa kanya, sabi nya sa akin is he rarely shows up and always may bad mouth about them as employees. I asked my batchmate kung gusto nya lumipat na sa carwash, which he, without any hesitation said, yes.

Right there, alam ko na tama yung tingin ko, may issue si colleague running a business. He got mad at me when I told him ipupullout ko na yung batchmate ko, kasi tao ko naman talaga sya sa carwash, saying mahihirapan ulit sya humanap ng store manager na hindi maarte. I told him ako maghahire ng tao for his convenience. Nakakuha ako ng tao and sanay talaga sya magmanage ng store, pero sabi ko sa kanya ireport nya sakin ang nangyayari sa store. Weeks later she told me medyo di nga maganda yung palakad ng colleague ko, so I decided magsurprise visit, I asked our store manager to inform me pag papunta sya. After all I almost thought na ako na yung nagpapatakbo ng business namin, from the money I brought in, yung clients and bulk orders na pinasok ko as sales and more. Di nga lang ako makapunta sa pwesto regularly sa dami ng lakad ko here in Metro and province.

Last Saturday, I received a message from store manager, pupunta si colleague with his gf and mom. So pumunta rin ako. I arrived 30 mins later after them and dumaan ako sa likod na door para hindi nila kita. Kakapasok ko pa lang ng gate, I heard my colleague voice saying ""*umalis ka sa harap ko, wala kang kwenta!*"" So di muna ako pumasok since rinig ko from the near window mga convo nila. Then I heard him again talking to that employee na ""*Umuwi ka, ang bobo bobo mo, yan na lang trabaho mo e*."" That employee ran to open the door where I was standing outside, pagbukas nya nagulat sya na andun ako. I saw her eyes na teary na so sumenyas ako na wag magingay and wait nya ko kasi papasok ako ng store.

Upon entering, I heard him shouting to his gf na nasa storefront ""*sabihin mo kay \*store manager, bilisan yung audit at baka maghanap si \*ako ng report, atat pa naman lagi yun.*"" like ang usapan naman every Saturday afternoon magpasa siya ng report sa akin. Si Store manager on her break pero my colleague told her to do the task kahit nakabreak since pwede naman daw sya gawin ng nakaupo.

In my mind, the dude is very different compared pag nasa office sya. Okay sya makipagusap and very positive yung character nya. You can see his immaturity pero gets mo kasi bata pa but he's improving naman.

Since nasa loob na ko, nakatalikod sya sakin, I called his attention. He was surprised and asked if bakit di raw ako dumaan sa harap. I told him kanina pa ko dun and naririnig ko sya, and I heard everything he said about our employees to his badmouth against me. He asked me for a management's talk, usap daw kami pati gf nya. I accepted, pero I asked the employees to join the meeting para malaman bakit ganun ang nangyayari. I was shocked when I heard from our employees yung mga words na ""*mga di kasi kayo nagaral kaya wag kayo magfeeling expert.*"" ""*pang sari sari store lang diskarte nyo hindi pang corporate.*"" and ""*Nagmamagaling ka, wala ka namang kwenta*."" these words daw came to my colleagues mouth kapag nagagalit sya.

So kaya pala nagaalisan mga tao namin, kahit ako aalis pag ganyan. I let our employees out na pero I requested to close the store and go home para they can cool down a bit. I talk to my colleague and his partner that I cannot run business with them kung ganyan sya, right there I said, magpupullout ako ng investments and assets ko. Si colleague nagalit, I can pullout daw pero yung drinks ko lang not the money I invested, akala siguro di ko binabasa yung books, sabi ko we gain since I invested so I will take my money and pati ibang gamit dun na galing sa akin. Yung profit, kanya na kung ayaw nya ibigay.

Last Monday, I pulled out yung mga investments ko sa kanila, I talk to my colleagues mom and gf, mas madali kausap yun e, they helped me withdraw my invested money sa bank, did the paperwork tas pina notary namin. The store is close since then, wala nang pumasok na employees namin. Si colleague, di sya nagpakita that time, absent din sa office, until now. Our CEO knows naman kasi sinumbong pa pala ako nun, pero sabi nya, labas sya sa transactions namin kasi di sya part ng business nya, he spoke to me naman, I told my boss na I can work with him professionally sa company but not as business partner.

Earlier I received a separate viber group from our 3 employees, di na raw sila papasok, I asked them if nabayaran ba sila nung last pay, ayaw nila na kunin. I told them ako na magbabayad, ayaw sana nila pero sabi ko pinasok naman nila yun so babayaran ko, right nila yun e. I also told them na I will help them find new jobs na fit sa kanila. Luckily si Store Manager nailakad ko na sa client ko before pa, she will start ata by feb 15. Yung 2 naman, I refer them to my client's na (convenience store company and logistics/courier company). I also send them a sack of rice each and some groceries.

Nakakahiya talaga yung experience and I learned a lot from this. I will always grateful to those employees who worked for me kaya as much as possible I'll give them extended help. At the very least nakalabas kami lahat sa toxic environment na yun.

A month later i got deployed into one of their restaurant branches, i was a BIT shocked since i applied for a barista position and was deployed as a dining staff right after training.

2024-02-01 07:02:09,Text-only,"so my ex-ad agency is so disgusting, especially the executive director","EDIT: a lot of people are messaging me to drop the name, para maiwasan. i'll just use emojis. you will get it if you've been looking at creative job openings at jobstreet.

üõ∏üêë

background: this ad agency located in mother ignacia, QC is so notorious employees couldn't keep up. they would only employ 10-11 people supporting a lot of clients (they're too many i lost count). 6 out of 10 employees decided to leave because:
1. they dump a shit ton of workload on us without giving us a chance to negotiate, kasi we need to keep our ""partners"" happy
2. managers would file insane incident reports on us for not complying to the deadline. 6/10 employees had PIPs at one point because of it.
3. a lot of ICs work beyond working hours without pay (8am-5pm schedule), because according to our contract, OT pay is invalid in a WFH set up. so during covid no one had any OT pays. there was no consideration even when some of my colleagues timed out at 5am, which was seen by all employees.
4. a manager was shocked that his overworked IC was denied regularization because apparently this executive director bitch decided to weigh in evals from other managers without informing him
5. we are not paid properly even though we were promoted. we had one colleague who was promoted from junior to senior IC with only an appraisal of 1-3k
6. in our quarterly evals, we have this ""team engagement"" shit criterion that bear a significant amount of weight. this is based on our engagement during ""fun meetings"" where we only play jackbox despite our workload. they'll give us low scores here kapag hindi kami favorite
7. no consideration to their employees especially if they're trying to reach a deadline. we had this colleague who was sick and had to take a week-long leave. when he came back, ED almost filed an incident report for loss of profit because they had to find a freelance resource to do his work
8. OA and feeling bagets si ED. she would yell in public, fake laugh, and make up stories to try to make us laugh. muntanga lang kala niya cute siya pag ganon siya
9. they have an offensive sense of humor at times. they're very fond of body shaming.
10. we had another colleague who caught covid and eventually recovered without any financial support from the company. when he came back, HR announced that SSS (i forgot the gov agency) can cover expenses for covid recovery. this colleague asked HR and the CEO in front of all of us if he's qualified to get one even though he has already recovered, to which they answered no and fucking laughed at his face saying ""kawawa ka naman""
11. ED would backstab a former employee who worked poorly during his time in the company, and would constantly make him the butt of the joke of every single thing that she thinks was funny. imagine being a fucking joke to a whole company

it's a lot but that's just the tip of the iceberg. 

no one came forward to DOLE, despite a lot of us talking about it. we feared that if we do so, it'll lessen the chance of finding a new job. heck, a lot of us badly needed work that time.

so fast forward, they recruited a lot of people to fill in the vacancies, most of them are fresh graduates or just got out of their first job. they've also fully RTO'd, and they've been posting stories on their company IG account whenever they have a fun thing going on.

ok so ito ang chika. ED's new directive for the company's social media is to show how ""happy"" they are as a ""family"" to spite those who left. a lot of former employees (including me) are still mutuals with that account, that's why she thought of doing it. napaka-immature talaga. she's 52 for god's sake. 

i don't care how they are doing right now in terms of fun, but i unfollowed them because i keep seeing the ED's face i just wanna throw up.

ito pa, she's keeps on making fun of some former employees like what she did to the former-former one. walang pakundangan kung magsalita. she really thinks she's so fucking funny. i may not be one of them but i feel so bad for them.

though to be fair, current employees do not like her at all. they feel the same way we did when we were still employed there (kaya nakasagap din ako ng chika). they're currently making plans and finding a new job before they could submit their resignation.

this ad agency's never gonna be better if they keep being like that. i'm not sure if other companies behave the same way, but if you want to gain loyalty and productivity from your employees, please, see your employees as humans. that's all we ask for.

tl;dr: ED is trying to make us former employees regret leaving the company by posting stories on their company IG of how ""happy"" they are as a ""family"". truth is the company is disgusting as fuck in terms of employee treatment, that's why a lot of us had to leave, as well as the current ones who replaced us.",31,18,1.0,Story üó£Ô∏è,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/1afvjgi/so_my_exad_agency_is_so_disgusting_especially_the/,1afvjgi

Example na lang. Limited bugdet or to no budget for activities para mas makagalaw kami ng maayos, no proper office set-up to conduct meetings, kumbaga intrinsic motivation na lang ang kukuhaan mo ng inspirasyon to do your work.

Power grabber ka din at balita namin pina-pulis niyo pa ang VP dyan para matanggal sa pwesto para sayo ulit ang galawan sa loob. Nakakahiya! Kunsintidor ka din lalo na sa isang TL mo na walang kwenta, maraming utang, laging late at POKPOK. Yes! Tama kayo. TL na POKPOK. Nanira ng pamilya dahil kinabit ang kapwa TL na may asawa't anak. Tapos nakikipagpukupukan sa agent na kitang kita sa CCTV. Proud pa si Matet na isigaw daw sa floor noong pumasok si TL ng ""WELCOME BACK MY FAVORITE DAUGHTER MALEYA!"" Hindi ka nahiya? Kasi ang mga agents mo sa floor kinakahiya na siya. 

Yan lang ang mga latest issue ng OB. Kaya hindi ninyo masisisi kung bakit gustong magaklas ng mga tao ngayon at puro galit at pinopost sa social media. Dahil nakakahiya ang galawan niyo! Ano kaya ang issue nyo sa February? Delayed ITR? Delayed na sahod ulit? Bagong kabitan issue ulit? Abangan nalang natin!

Yung mga companies (big or small) na kung makapag set ng policies ay akala mo sila na yung may-ari sa buhay ng employees nila; 6-days work week, split-offs, sudden schedule changes, etc. Idagdag na din yun pagpilit na ""we're family here"" culture.

Recently napagtaasan ko ng boses ang friend ko after niyang magkwento ng mga nangyayari sa office nila. I won't go into details, pero basically ang nangyayari is obvious exploitation.

Yung tipong sakto lang yung sahod mo at kunwari maganda benefits para mag stay ka don at hindi ka makakapag-resign dahil isang linggo lang na mabakante ka, wala kang kakainin.

Ang dami kong sinabing pwedeng solution sa friend ko, nag offer na din akong tumulong pero siyempre, ang nakuha kong sagot ""tska n siguro kapag nakapag ipon na"" Like...girl! Di ka nga makapag-ipon at kaya nga kita binibigyan ng strategy and help para makapag start na mag ipon.

Natanggap ako sa company last December. According sa interview and sa job offer na signed, may saturdays akong pasok kapag needed. Stated na ang schedule ko is M to F at magkakasaturday lang in case maging busy.

Pagpasok ko sa company, sinabi ng supervisor ko na regular schedule ko na daw is Monday to Saturday. May policy rin na kapag umabsent ako this week need ko pumasok sa saturday next week.

Ngayon, I want to resign na kasi dealbreaker sa akin ang weekends na may pasok. I agreed nung una kasi kapag kailangan lang naman daw may sat. 

Pwede ba akong mag immediate resignation considering na iba nasa job offer at wala rin naman ako pinirmahan contract na need ko magrender for 30 days? Wala rin po ako itturnover kasi di pa naman ako nakapag 1month.

2024-01-31 15:00:38,Text-only,Am I an ungrateful person or I am just a greedy envious employee? A post about salary which should I ask an increase or do I even deserve it?," Hello there I am quiet in a predicament here since I have been working for this company for almost 4 years now this coming march and I'm just wondering would it be fine if I would ask my boss directly to give me a raise? Note: This was first ever job so I don't really know what to do.

When I got hired back then for a specific position I performed well and pretty much became a top performing agent hence I actually got promoted eventually after a year of working in this position but my daily rate didn't change and still the same which was PHP 909.09.

I accepted the promotion even though my daily rate is still the same but was told that I would get an increase after passing the probation period hence I gladly accepted and worked diligently.

After months passed 6 months I finally got a a salary increase and my daily rate would now be PHP 1k I am a bit sad since I thought that it would be at least a bigger amount which I mean for minimum wage is already big even x2 so I told to myself that it is good enough and just be grateful which I really am.

Time passed new people got promoted for my position so I somewhat got promoted without announcement since I was now an assistant manager to our department which I am now the one who trains new trainers which I definitely did without any salary increase. As time passed by when the new trainers probation ended which only took them 2 months instead of said 6 our salary became the same I got an increase as well as them and the same amount as mine which was 1200php a big jump I am happy for myself and definitely don't mind them having same salary as me even though I have been working for the company far longer than they are but I guess I should just be thankful and not be devoured by envy or is it envy?

now time passed by almost two years having the same rate the company faced some issues hence the hiring process got halted then we had take up a lower position which going back to what we used to do hence our salary went back to the first rate that I had when I was just starting but still I stuck with the company and worked well at first but definitely felt bummed out that my salary got so little but nevertheless I got some commissions out of my hard work which made my salary bigger.

Months passed by which now is the current timeline I was able to get back into my position as an assistant manager with the same rate back then 1,200. My question would now be is that would it be fine for me to ask a raise to my boss I know its big but we only work on average 20 days per month or even 22 days max.

I am grateful for what I am receiving but I guess its a bit little considering we work from home and we don't have any incentives whether for internet or anything no government contributions with all this inflation going up I guess my salary would/should also go up I guess I don't really know what to do.

Am I an ungrateful person? or am I just a greedy one? or should it be fine to ask a raise despite on what's going on with the company or i don't really even know what I am currently ranting right now but I guess its just clearly that I am not contented with I am receiving. which makes me look like I am an ungrateful bastard or idrk.

Eh kaso pati payment terminals ako daw mag-apply. Tapos dapat daw included daw ako sa planning ng mga product shoots. Tapos may quota din daw dapat kami. Also, sales din ako sa mismong store nila, so ako din mag-assist ng clients. Ako din gagawa ng quotations, all without proper product training.

The value proposition is nice, pero for someone lowballed from 70k to 40k (at hinayaan ko na nga kasi once a month on site lang naman), I think managing 10 shitty clients per day and being the only one doing client facing (via call) in behalf of the work of the specialists is just...unreasonable.

Sa mga walang alam katulad ko noon, akala ko talaga ang **LinkedIn** ay para lang siyang **Jobstreet**, **Indeed** (by the way, dito ako nakahanap ng work), or **Glassdoor** na hanapan lang talaga ng work. Pero hindi pala. Social Site pala talaga siya na intended for professionals.

Sa'kin kasi inayos ko talaga **LinkedIn** Profile ko kahit hindi ko nagagamit sa Current work ko. Nilagyan ko talaga na custom Cover Photo, Profile Pic na pang-Facebook ang datingan, ayoko nga mag-picture ng Grad Pic du'n. Pinoy lang naman gumagawa nu'n. Sa ibang bansa naman, parang profile pic na rin sa typical na social media, tapos Description/About Me ko talaga ang haba. Yung Work Experiences ko, nilagay ko talaga pati tasks na ginagawa ko pati naglagay ako iilang pictures. Para hindi lang imbento at totoo talaga. Pati Projects nilalagay ko. Tapos nagpo-post ako once a month. Tapos halos twice a day ko binubuksan, umaga at gabi para lang i-open mga Notifications na hindi ko naman binabasa.

Ang International kasi masyadong yung approach ng **LinkedIn**. Hindi makamasa. Kahit yung **Philippine HR Group** du'n, mas active mga taga-ibang bansa. Kumbaga sa Pinas, parang **HR** lang yata talaga active du'n para mag-post ng **Job Hiring.**

Useful naman siya sa totoo lang. Kaya nga lang may bayad para manood ng mga webinar, or video tutorial or video lesson, may pa-premium pa.

Kaya curious ako sa mga LinkedIn Profile ninyo, active ba kayo roon? Like nagagamit niyo ba siya sa day-to-day work ninyo? Nagpo-post din ba kayo? May ka-interact din ba kayo parang News Feed niyo or puro re-post lang kayo? May laman ba siya kung may achievements ba kayo sa school or work? Updated ba LinkedIn ninyo?

May company ba rito na yung LinkedIn Account nila big deal? Like ayon talaga gamit nilang social for work, communication with colleagues, hindi mga messaging app katulad ng WhatsApp, Viber, Skype or Telegram. Tipong every work related, ginagamit talaga yung LinkedIn nila or depende lang talaga sa Department ng Work 'to?

2024-01-29 17:59:48,Text-only,"PM Colleague issue: If you were in my position, what would you do?","In our company, I am currently handling two clients (consisting of six projects) while my 1st boss is only responsible for one client (consisting of three to four projects). Technically, I am under his supervision, but we hold the same position in the company due to regionalization.

Recently, I encountered a problem with manpower, so I decided to outsource some additional manpower. However, as per our PD, we need to maximize the overall manpower in our department, which requires us to undergo reorganization. Three clients will now be merged, and the workload will be divided among the areas that my colleague and I are currently handling.

To my surprise, my 1st boss had a meeting with my supervisor, who is in charge of the clients I handle, and they discussed a reorganization plan without informing me.

To summarize:
My boss bypassed me and decided to handle the three clients alone without communicating with me.
She was offered a national position but declined it, suggesting that I should be transferred instead. The other boss agreed to this plan, but our higher-level bosses are unaware of it.
If they insist on transferring me, I prefer to resign. However, I have a cash bond worth around 150K because of training, which would require me to stay for another three years.",1,1,1.0,Advice Needed ü§î,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/1adrsv8/pm_colleague_issue_if_you_were_in_my_position/,1adrsv8

Nov 7, 2023: filed resignation - requested to the management to waive the 60 days notice in my contract to just 30 days notice but got rejected. negotiations took a lot of days but still ended up getting rejected.

Nov 24, 2023 - I informed my superior and team that Nov 30 will be my last day since the management did not accept the waiver of my notice period

Nov 30, 2023 - last day of work. surrendered all company assets and sent the transition plan to my superior

Dec 11, 2023 - received Return-to-work order and it was mentioned that if i did not report to work within 5 days, i will get dismissed.

Jan 8, 2024 - received notice of termination dated january 2.¬†

i informed them that i was already dismissed since dec 16 (5days after i received the RTW order) and remind them the 30days allowable time to give my backpay.

they said that i have to get my clearance signed first before they will release the backpay within¬†30days.

Jan 11, 2024 - i authorized someone in the company to route my clearance. Clearance is now on-going

2024-01-27 16:34:24,Text-only,"Great place to work ""Daw""","Hello po sa lahat i just need to get this of my chest to move foward. 

So i was working for this company na part of ""Great place to work in the Philippines"". Well as for my experience with company and the management, they doesn't deserve to be part of this great place to work kinesu. Why? Sobra yung bad experience ko sa company nato. Let me start the whole story.

Before being part of this company, i was working for a small bpo company along mandaluyong. Well the great thing about this small bpo na napasukan ko before is kahit maliit yung compensation package nila unlike other companies around it maka tao naman yung management at mga boss at yung politics nila dito. The only reason na i have to give up my career with them kasi hindi kakayanin at kulang na kulang pa ang sinasahod ko for my cost of living sa mandaluyong at sa binibigay ko sa family ko sa province (somewhere in south). Btw technical account yung hawak ko sa BPO nato. At dahil sa kulang na kulang at madalas ay short pa kasi maliit ang sahod na realize ko na ang hirap pala sa manila. Ang mahal ng cost of living ko vs sa sinasahod ko (take note hindi po ako condo living or what ha? Pero ang mahal padin ng expenses ko) nag decide ako na mag hanap nalang ng mas malapit na trabaho at makaka pag uwian ako samin para tipid na kesa ibabayad ko sa rental ko na 6k sa mandaluyong excluded pajan sa 6k rent yung bills ko electricity, water at internet.

So eto na nga, na kita ko sa FB na nag post sila ng open house and they're hiring for technical support with good compensation package (2x ng sinasahod ko sa bpo sa mandaluyong yung offer). Sobrang saya ko that time kasi dininig ng nasa itaas yung hiling ko na makahanap ng trabaho na malapit, may magandang pasahod at higit sa lahat eh pasok sa experience ko as a technical support. 

Eto na nga. Na hire nako sa company nato at nakapag resign ako ng ayos with the previous company. Dito na nag simula ang bad experience ko. First bad experience, nakalagay sa job posting ay ""technical support"" only to find out na hindi pala tech account to sales account pala at hard selling pa (pushy sale sobra). Hindi important kung maresolved mo ang concern ng cx mo mas importante kung mabebentahan mo ng ina-upsell mong products and services. I have nothing against this kind of things pero sana naging honest nalang sila sa job posting nila at nilagay nalang na ""Sales account for tech program"" hindi yung may pa ""technical account"" pa kayo eh wala naman kayong pake kung maresolve ba or hindi as long as mabentahan yung cx. Tapos kapag mahina ka bumenta automatic terminated ka. Naalala kopa nung unang pasok namin sa production para mag call sabi samin ng mga tenured agents ""Welcome to hell"" (ay talagang hell naman eh pag wala kang benta ippressure ka mag benta at talagang pahiya ka sa buong team)  Yung KPI nila yung sales ang largest chunk so pag di mo napasa yun wala goodbye trabaho ka talaga kahit anong galing mo mag calls or what kasi hindi naman yun need nila. Ang need nila e yung magaling bumenta kahit walang kwenta sa quality ng call at kahit hindi mo matulungan si cx pasok ka sa banga. Ako at yung mga kakilala ko na kasabay ko nakikita palang namin yung entrance nung office nasusuka na kami at uwing uwi na kasi alam naming impyerno na talaga don sa hirap.

Second, sakitin talaga akong tao at kahit sa previous company ko alam nilang sakitin ako at super thankful ako sa previous company kasi naiintindihan nila ako sa part nayon. Dito mga bes sa new company hindi. Kese hodang mamatay ka wala silang pake. Hindi valid mag kasakit dito. Grabe yung naging experience ko dito, imagine tinatrangkaso ako to the point na nag cchills na katawan ko tapos nag paalam lang ako sa TL ko na sana makapag request kahit 1 hr rest mula sa clinic wala naman akong balak mag pa sent home. kahit konting pahinga lang kasi hindi ko na talaga kaya. Yung 1 hr lunch ko itinulog ko na nga lang at ipinahinga pero talagang hindi kaya. Aba si accla sabi ba naman ""ano mas importante? Yang 1hr rest mo oh yang magiging lost hour mo na impacting not only for you but for the whole team"" aba teh? Ano bako? Robot hindi pwede mag pahinga? Hindi pwedeng mag kasakit? Eh kahit nga tinatrangkaso nako malala pinasukan ko padin siya tapos 1hr rest lang hindi pako mapagbigyan? At dahil sa kinukunsensya ako ng TL ko about it tiniis ko not until one time na hindi ko na talaga kinaya, tandang tanda ko yun last shift ko na sana kahit ang lala padin ng trangkaso ko I'm willing to got to work kasi last shift na and I'm just looking forward sa restday ko. Naging severe lalo yung trangkaso ko. Hindi ko na maikilos ng ayos ang katawan ko in pain nako sa buong katawan ko at parang pakiramdam ko eh nababaldado nako so nag pa checkup agad ako only to find out na may malalang bagay pala sa katawan ko na nag ccause bakit ako tinatrangkaso at nag kaka ganon (i won't disclose wthe whole medical thingy) to the point na i need to undergo major surgery for it. Aba ang TL ko mukhang wapakels sa situation ko mas importante padin ang mawawalang benta at lost hours kesa sa life and death situation na I'm dealing with. Grabe nakaka iyak lang na imagine kung mas maaga ako nakapag pa checkup at nabigyan ng pag kakataon na mag pahinga edi sana naagapan pero dahil sa selfishness nila at ng whole management hindi ko natutukan yung health ko. Tapos ang ending iteterminate nila ako dahil unfit na ako sa trabaho due to my health conditions at sa procedure na inunder-gone ko. Ginusto ko ba to? Kung pwede nga lang i-distribute yun sakit pinamigay ko na sainyong mga lakup yung sakit ko ng kayo ang makaranas nitong hirap na to ewan ko nalang kung kayanin niyo. Grabe yung inabot ko sa company nato. Drain na drain nako emotionally at mentally sa pinag dadaanan ko sa personal life ko tapos ganon pa sa trabaho. 


Apaka dami ko pang bad experience dito sa company nato na hindi kona i-include. Hindi worth-it yung pinapasahod ng company nato sa binibigay nilang stress sayo. Hindi naman ako pasaway na trabahador. Nag ttrabaho naman ako ng ayos. Pero bakit need kong maranasan tong mga bagay nato. May pasabi sabi pa silang dito work-life balance at people's first kami. The whole management it self is teaching us to be compassionate and empathetic towards our customer pero kayo mismong nasa management and higher op hindi niyo magawa sa mga ahente niyo. Well bilog ang mundo what comes around goes around ika nga. Lahat ng ginawa nyong mali sa trabahador niyo babalik sayo at sana 10x ang balik and for the record HINDI nyo deserve mapasama sa the great place to work kasi HINDI naman kayo marunong trumato ng tama sa mga nag ttrabaho sainyo sa dami niyong kaso sa NLRC ng unjustified termination hindi ko alam pano pa kayo nakaka pasok sa criteria na ""best place to work"" kung ganon yung management and work environment niyo. Sana nakaka tulog pa kayo ng mahimbing sa ginawa niyo sa mga kawawang empleyado.

2024-01-27 10:29:57,Text-only,Perfectionist na Team Lead,"Pa-rant lang haha. So I have this officemate na naka-close ko na over the years and honestly mabait naman sya. Pulido sya sa work so everyone trusts her. 

Problem is, she's a perfectionist. Actually gets ko naman na its sometimes okay lalo na pag involve ang work, to make things efficient and effective. She doesn't micromanage naman, kaya lang mahilig sya makialam sa diskarte mo ng pagtatrabaho kahit same lang naman ng end result. Tapos lahat nalang napapansin nya, as in. 
Gusto nya lagi na gayahin namin kung paano sya magwork. Tbh, ginawa na namin yun, and hindi naman kami nagrereklamo about it sometimes. 

Kaso pansin ko parang gusto nya yata pati way of thinking nya sa lahat ng bagay i-pattern din namin sa kanya. Lagi nya sinasabi suggestion lang naman daw, pero madalas nya inuulit. A bit of background on her, lumaki kasi syang independent at lahat gusto nya outlined and organized up to the last bit. Minsan ok lang samin yun ugali nya na yun kasi nakakatulong din naman samin sa work lalo na kung meron nao-overlook. 

Its just that we only felt lang na para bang iniisiip nya na that the way she does things is kinda like a standard na dapat din namin ma-adapt. Dumiskarte man kami ng sarili namin, kahit pa iisa lang naman ang output, pag minsan di sya satisfied e papansinin parin nya. Even on the smallest thing na hindi naman actually nakakaapekto sa work namin eh pinapansin parin nya. 

Mabait sya, and she's nice naman. Mejo nao-off lang talaga kami sa tuwing gumaganyan sya to the point na minsan naiinis na rin ako.",1,7,0.57,Rant üò°,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/1ac03y8/perfectionist_na_team_lead/,1ac03y8

Hi, (29F) i am currently a marketing employee sa isang company who owns a well-known facial clinic chain pero dun ako sa isang business nila nagwowork. 

So eto na nga, yung head ng planta let‚Äôs call her Maria‚Ä¶ she‚Äôs been with the company ever since and parang right hand siya ni business owner. One time nag alok si Maria na pumunta kaming marketing team sa planta para makita daw namin process kung paano ginagawa product. So me and my team said yes and magseset daw siya ng date.

We‚Äôre waiting for Maria‚Äôs confirmation via text, email, or kahit call kaso wala kaming narecieve from her. Dumating yung time na nagka-tonsillitis ako ng malala and my doctor said na wag muna ako pumasok for 2 days so I messaged my manager informing her na ganito situation and they approved my leave. Suddenly Maria went to office nung day na naka-sick leave ako (day 1) para sunduin kami and pumunta sa sa planta.

During my sick leave (day 1), si manager lagi akong kinukulit about work na parang di ako nakaleave so i thought na pasok nalang ako kinabukasan even the doctor said na rest lang kasi nagwowork pa din ako. Tapos nagulat ako the next day, sinisigawan na ako ni Maria dahil hindi daw ako nagsabi sa kanya na wala ako nung day na susunduin niya ako. I was just quiet at the moment since I was taken aback from her reaction and masakit pa lalamunan ko. 

The next day, the president and his wife called me to his office. I knew na pagagalitan ako kasi sino ba kakampihan nila diba? Tapos they asked me questions like ‚Äúmay boyfriend ka ba? Pag nag aaway ba kayo ng boyfriend mo nagsosorry ka? Sa magulang mo ba nagsosorry ka?‚Äù Tapos biglang ‚Äúhija katoliko ka ba? may bukas na simbahan diyan malapit sa office, mangumpisal ka para gumaan pakiramdam mo‚Äù pero hindi pa nagtatapos diyan THEY EVEN GAVE ME PRAYER BOOKLETS PARA DAW MAGDASAL AKO!

Idc if pagalitan nila ako if about work yun, pero para sabihan na mangumpisal and bigyan ako prayer books?? Sobrang below the belt na, hindi na related sa trabaho. 

TL;DR: i was on sick leave when our head plant came to office para sunduin kami then she got mad cause i didn‚Äôt ‚Äúinformed‚Äù her tapos owners of the company said na mag confess ako and gave me prayer booklets",42,30,0.95,Rant üò°,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/1abaoa4/pinagkukumpisal_ako_ng_employer_ko/,1abaoa4

The problem: they ignoring my request to improve my skills, they bench me but because I work fast they tend to see my hours as undertime. I tried telling them I want to move to development team again so I can code but they refuse and want me to do the same all around task (coding, database, deployment, qa, customer support). Anything Jira throws me I will do it

More problem: the company is starting to be very political. The management is trying to downplay 10 completed task per day but only required me 3 hours to finish it. They want me to log 8 hours and stuff but they gonna say ‚Äúhow you justify this hours blah blah blah‚Äù. They don‚Äôt want me to improve my skills or undergo bootcamps while others are allowed due to their role (kissing ass to this one control freak manager)

Aim: to survive; I like the pay so how to go IDGAF mode? Does not reading email and waiting for my task is a good bet, and only replying when tagged is the best way to go? I am very active in my role because I was kinda in the support team at first, and I do help a lot of the newbies in their task when they feel lost, so it was not my nature to be this chill and benched, and always on the look to help colleagues.

Sya actually ang may-ari ng kumpanya kaya sya yung may boses talaga sa lahat. Ang siste, pati sa pinakamaliit na detalye ng trabaho, pinapakialaman nya to the point na nalilihis na yung mga deliverables sa project. IT and Business Consulting nga pala ang nature ng work namin doon at nag-ooffer ng custom-fit na system sa mga companies. Ang kalakaran, pag hindi ka nag-OT, tamad ka at ayaw mong pagsilbihan si God. Wag daw masyadong magwork para sa pera kaya hindi sila nagbabayad ng OT simula nung pumutok ang covid hanggang ngayon na lahat na ng kumpanya ay nagsisimula nang makabawi. Hindi naman sila actually nahirapan lahit during covid kasi IT nga ang business. Pwedeng magwork kahit saan basta may internet. Ang naging downside lang, kailangan nasa google meet or zoom ka buong araw, minsan magdamag pa dahil kailangan magwork kasama ng boss. Kami na empleyado, need magstart magtrabaho ng umaga pero kailangan namin hintayin ang boss namin na gabi pa umaattend ng meetings. Ang masaklap, hindi pwedeng tumanggi sa extended working hours kasi nga, magagalit si God at kailangan daw namin magwork para sa kanya. Imagine yung ginagawa niyang gaslighting para lang abusuhin mga tao? Okay lang naman din na magtrabaho nang more than 8 hours pero hindi araw-araw. 6x a week. Ang masama pa, pinag-OT ka na na walang bayad, makakarinig ka pa ng mga mura at paninigaw galing sa kanya. If words can kill, siguro namurder na kami. Ganyan kalala. Kaya nga kahit na nasa kasagsagan ng pandemic, hindi na ako nagdalawang isip na magresign. Kesehodang mahirap maghanap ng trabaho. Okay lang. Basta makaalis lang sa kumpanya na walang pagpapahalaga sa mga tao at tanging pera lang ang iniisip. Sobrang supportive ko dati sa vision ng company kaso sobrang lala na ang ugali ng boss. Mas mabuti pa talagang iwanan sila. Plus, yung sales pitch nila, sobrang layo na sa katotohanan. Halos ‚Äúlokohin‚Äù na nila prospect clients nila kasi nagbebenta sila ng products na wala silang expertise. Kukuhanan lang nila ng idea ang clients instead na sila ang magturo. ‚ÄúConsultants‚Äù pa ang tingin nila sa mga sarili nila pero wala naman talaga silang alam. At sana, yung mga naiwan ay magkaroon din sila ng lakas ng loob na subukan ang buhay sa labas. Mas maraming opportunities at mas maraming companies na pwedeng magpahalaga sa kung anong kaya nating maioffer sa kanila.

2024-01-26 04:14:22,Text-only,Any affordable mental health services in the metro for a BPO employee?,"Been with this employer for a year and 3 weeks now, but I switched managers right after my regularization last year because she moved to a different company. I admit I've had several hiccups performing this role because...

I work for 2 different employers full-time simultaneously. (Shocking I know, but in this economy with zero support from anyone, it's necessary.) I've been at Job 1 since 2019, but because of the pandemic, I had to take on another one. Kept switching the second hustle around til I finally landed on Job 2 in 2022. Thought I could handle both just fine since the work's remote, but I think I'm teetering to the edge.

Because of aforementioned hiccups, I've been put on a month-long PIP at Job 2 right after I hit my first anniversary, and to be frank, I'm losing my mind over it. I feel like I'm performing even worse than ever because of the added monitoring. I'm struggling to keep my focus because I now feel like nothing I do is right. 

I can't admit to my manager that I dwell on my past mistakes, overthink everything, and think that every week that we have our 1-on-1, I feel my mind shutting down because I fear he'll point out a mistake that my overthinking brain missed. I can't tell anyone here that I two-time either because I need both incomes to support myself.

I can't give up my messed-up career now, but I doubt I can find any better because I didn't finish college (unrelated). So I'll have to stick with what I got. I know I'm good at what I do; I just can't keep up the professional sanity to continue this bit anymore.

I know that for now, I just need a good sit-down therapy session, so where can I find one here? Can anyone recommend a place or a therapist I can reach out to?

Thanks and sorry if this story took some odd turns.

P.S. IDK if this helps, but I've had no such performance issues with Job 1, only Job 2.

Translated as: ""Good morning maam/sir. Gusto ko lang ishare dito ang problema ko na walang sweldo sa Zanorte hospital (short for Zamboanga del Norte Medical Center). Nagtrabaho ako sa ZNMC for 1 year and 5 months pero nagresign ako noong December
2023. First 9 months sa trabaho, ok naman ang sahuran kahit delay ng 2-3 months, matitiis ko pa kase alam kong ganyan talaga ka delay ang sahuran ng Job Order sa govt. Pero after that, hanggang ngayon di ko pa natanggap ang April to November 2023 na sahod like
it's been 10 months na grabe naman jusko pati pasko at new year wala akong maibigay na panghanda sa pamilya ko. Mas kawawa pa yung iba na nagpatuloy pa sa trabaho nagtitiis na walang natanggap na sweldo. 0o kasalanan ko rin na nagtiwala ako sa gobyerno na mag-antay lang pero it's been 10 MONTHS asan na yung
mga pinangako niyo?? Natrigger ako nung nagfollow-up na ako sa capitol, pinapasa2x ako sa kung kani-kanino tapos sinabihan pa kami na hindi kami mabigyan ng April, May, June na sahod dahil wala kaming Job Order contract kase wala pang budget. Dagdag pa nila, hindi na
talaga kami mabigyan ng sahod kase close na ang 2023 at tapos na yearly obligation. Like WTF?? Kung hindi man kami mabigyan ng sahod ngayong Feb, magkita na lang tayo sa Tulfo. Sa mga mah ganitong sitwasyon, PM kayo sa akin because if we are not going to voice out, paikot
ikutin lang tayo at idadaan sa matamis na salita. Numero uno pa sa plataporma nila ang healthcare workers tapos ano na?? Blood and sweat ang binuhos namin
sa pagttrabaho namin sa ospital tapos depression and anxiety and sinukli nila. Hindi nla ba nakkita sitwasyon namin? I know ang iba ok lang matagal mabigyan ng sahod pero sa akin hindi kase ako ang bumubuhay sa aking pamilya. I know common practice po ang delay na
sahod pero 10 F**KING MONTHS ay di na po tama yon! If di nila mabigyan ang april, may, at june, harap na lang tayo sa Tulfo or sa Ombudsman. I hope ma post mo to
admin pakitago na lang ang name saka pic thank you very much.'


TLDR: isang healthcare worker ng Zamboanga del Norte medical center Job order under province of zamboanga del norte ang hindi nabigyan ng sahod ng sampung
buwan. Imagine 10 MONTHS NA WALANG SAHOD?? What kind of quackery did the government do?? Seriously nakakahiya yan sa office nila if ever totoo. I wonder bakit hindi ito nabalita sa national TV. Ganito na ba ang
pilipinas ngayon? I pray for kababayan for justice and his/her timely situation. As an OFW nurse, kaya nga ako umalis sa bansa dahil sa ganitong kalakaran ng sistema.I ddnt expect na 2024 na may ganito pa rin.

Di ko gamit main ko kasi same sya ng main kong username na gnagamit hahaha and i'm using mobile to type so sorry po sa mga typos if there's any.

Nagwork ako sa isang company na to last 2017 to 2019ish. Maayos naman ang pakikitungo saken ng company na yun. In fact, binigyan nila ako ng choice para wag na lang mag resign instead long vaca na lang instead na paid pero di ako pumayag. Pagod na kasi ako and may nangyayare kasi sa personal life ko kaya gusto ko na lang lumayas for good. I render for good 30 days and umalis with COE and complete docs.

Im so confused really.

Muntikan na ako di makapasok dun sa company na un dahil dun sa not for rehire na sabi nila na un.

Anyways, it's been years and gusto ko lang sya ilabas. Ayaw ko na mag work ulit dun dahil sa nangyare kasi feeling ko sobrang petty nya na ewan.

2024-01-25 09:23:55,Text-only,client wants to hire me directly,"H! Need help.

I am currently under a VA agency which pays less than 20k per month pero less than 2k USD binabayad ng client (yes, ang lala). I was starting palang sa industry so I nigrab ko na for experience and sa skills and knowledge na maacquire ko.

During our daily meeting, tinanong niya ako if recorded daw ba yung meeting, sabi ko hindi. Then sabi niya he wants to hire me directly kasi magkakaroon daw siya ng business partner at ayun daw mas kaya magbayad sa akin, at di daw nila need ng 40 hours per week, kahit 10 lang. Ofcourse gusto ko. And dahil sa bugso ng damdamin, naopen ko nga yung about sa salary ko (hindi ko exact sinabi na 20k lang pero mali pa rin kasi it was stated sa contract na confidential) and told him na I am planning to leave the company. Sabi niya bakit daw ganoon yung agency, etc.

Kinabukasan, he asked for my personal email address para daw dun namin pagusapan. He seemed serious dun sa offer niya. I told him na binasa ko yung contract at may non-solicitation clause which bawal magwork sa client w/in 2 years of leaving the agency. I asked him kung may non-compete clause sa contract nila and he said yes. Then I told him na the offer is great (we haven't discussed about the salary if ever), and we can do it if we can both compromise and keep it  to which he agreed. Sabi niya pa marami daw siya kakilala na pwede niyang ioffer sa akin as client.

My questions are:
  1.  Should I go for it? If yes, siya ba gagawa nung contract or ako? Can I request for additional clause lalo na yung confidentiality? Kaso nabanggit niya to a business partner niya bago niya pa iopen sa akin yung offer.
  2.  Ano po dapat ko gawin para di mahuli? Mauna magresign bago matapos contract nila ni agency? Or magtanggap lang ng client na bigay ni agency and sideline lang si current client? Then tsaka ko na tatanggapib yung ioffer niyang ibang clients?
  3.  Is $5 per hour okay? Mali din kasi ako na sinabi kong 1/4 lang nakukuha ko sa payment niya sa agency so nakita ko na nicompute niya at baka dun niya pa ibase yung salary ko. Wala siyang sinabi na tatapatan niya or what. Tinanong niya lang ako but since I don't have any idea, wala akong sinabi.
  4.  May tracking system yung agency (activtrak). Kung gagawa ba ako ng tasks sa ibang user account but same device, matatrack pa rin?

As I observe myself I see no progress in my tasks because mostly encoding of sales invoices and other clerical tasks as well as nagfefacebook me and watch dramas because wla n rin gagawin. I know I should be grateful for having a job but it's a minimum wage and 2 hrs ung travel ko from house to work naguguilty rin me ksi sasahod ako with small accomplishments tas wla pangb natitira  but at least positive ung work environment hehe but I don't really see my growth and future here ksi knti lng rin tlaga kmi n employees and mtaas pangarap ko ksi and hrap maging mhrap ka

the other side of this story is I already lose hope to be part of the hospitality industry n malayong malayo s tinapusan ko n management. but my prayers ended up calling me to have another interview but in a different department kinakbahan ako ksi I need to prepare cause maybe this is my last chance  ganito pala kahirap s real world lol. finding your purpose khit di mo alam ano b tlga gsto mo

Ang problema ngayon nung 1 buwan pa lang ako wala halos akong ginagawa at di niya ako tinuruan sa mga dapat gawin at shes acting na alam ko everything, ang pagkakasabe saken ng HR bago ako mahire meron daw akong 6 months training pero kabaliktaran wala talaga, ang tanging ginagawa ko nalaamang is mag adapt sa mga ginagawa ng mga ka team ko at nagtatanong.

Puro din siya parinig na ‚Äú dpat yung mapapasahan ng trabaho ko dedicated‚Äù habang may ibang mga tao at may nakkakarinig sa kanya, ako lang naman ang tanging sasalo ng dati nyang trabaho pero di ko maintindihan bakit di nya ako mapagkatiwalaan o mabigyan ng chance.

Fast forward, may mga project ako ngayon at halos lahat ako lang gumawa at minsan lang ako magtanong dahil minsan makikita mo sa facial expressions nya/at ng mga kateam ko na ayaw maobliga na magturo sa baguhan.

Pinaabot ko to sa pinaka boss naming lahat, kahit sya nagulat sa nangyari at siya daw mag aasikaso to fix this, umiyak na rin ako sa kanya sa kadahilanang di ko ineexpect na mangyyare sakin ito.

Monday, nagkita kita ang lahat at pinatawag ako ng manager ko at magusap daw kami, ang statement niya saken ‚Äúbakit umabot sa pinakaboss namin at san daw nanggaling ang galit ko‚Äù, di ko maintindihan bakit muka pa akong masama? Hindi ko inaaccept mga reason niya dahil ginagaslight niya ako at nangangatwiran, humingi siya ng dispensa dahil napagalaman nga namin na hindi kami ito.

2024-01-25 03:07:01,Text-only,"Ako yung na agrabyado, pero ako yung nalagay sa PIP","Mag-oone year anniversary na pala to sa work ko and I don't know how I've made it this long.

Just this month I was put on PIP for not being ""culturally fit"" sa office namin, yung reason? Ginrey-rock ko yung ex HR representative namin.

Context lang about me, I'm one of the youngest members of the company and nasa at least 4 years yung gap naming with our older co-workers. Basically my co-workers are all in their early to mid 30s. Maliit lang company namin, but this isn't my first company but this is one of the first companies where I felt very comfortable with the work and environment.

We're very lean din sa company namin, for the PH team 9 lang kami lahat. 

It all started when I developed a friendship with one of the managers from a different department. Now we don't exactly work in the same department so wala talagang kinalaman ang work with how we became friends. It just turned out one day that she liked hanging out with me and we listen to a lot of similar music - we got even closer when I offered to help her get tickets to one concert she wanted to go do bad pero conflict siya with a work-trip. I had the connections and di naman ako madamot so I secured them for her and she was thankful. Ever since then, we'd get into conversations about concerts, music fests, travel, the like. Yan lang kasi escape ko from all the stresses of work, yan lang din reason why I work hard to be able to afford those.

Now comes the trouble, si close friend M ko sa office, is also best friends with the HR representative ng company. Siya yung nagpapasok and they go way back, even being co workers in a previous job once before our company now.

Before I would even feel like I'm intruding in their friendship when close friend would ask me to go with them both to buy office supplies, or run errands for the company during weekends. Again, I'm a homebody and going out sometimes would do my mental health good. Okay naman yung dynamic at first, kaso I just noticed na parang, close friend (36) gets treated badly by HR representative (33).

Me (25) minding my own business, kept that observation to myself kasi at the end of the day, wala naman akong say sa friendship nila. If time yung basehan, they're probably tighter than me and my close friend kasi they've been friends for longer, pero that doesn't really mean anything to me.

3 months into my employment sa company, I also found one of my close friends lets name her B needing work, and I'm the type to help out whenever I can. So I put in a good work, and thankfully si B napasok. Take note around this time okay pa kami. Super solid naming ng ex-best friend ko, she's 4 years older than me so I respect her the way I would my elders. Close friend M even encouraged me to put in the good word because she says she trusts me with whoever I vouch for especially since B will be working under her in case ma-hire siya. 

And B did get hired, she would work under close friend M, and I'd be drowning in work from my department while also training B while I offload some of my responsibilities to her at the request of the company to make me focus on other things.

Around this time din I found myself having to hold back on company gatherings (may weekly dinners kasi kami every wednesday) because my papa got diagnosed with cancer, and my mental health was very bad due to overworking myself.

One day though, pinagalitan ako ng boss ko, which is the co-founder, because may nagkamali with handling a client, and sadly it was B. Of course, best friend ko si B dun so I tried my best para i-cushion yung galit ng boss ko and para naman di siya mapagalitan. I made sure close friend M knew so she can also help me out as B is directly under her naman.

Both close friend M and I spent a good 4 hours solving the problem, and di man lang nag reply si B sa amin. 

Hours later (after the shift, so weekend na) nakita ko nalang si B na nagsusubtweet ng masasamang words (;\~:) pertaining to me about work and even saying I'm using my mental health as an excuse. 

Why she was attacking me? I don't know. I was too busy hours before that cleaning up her mess.

I told close friend M about it and she was just confused as I was where all this hostility was coming from, especially when close friend M and I have been cleaning up after friend B ever since she got into the company.

The kicker here is si friend B has always confided to me about having post partum, the reason why I wanted her to get into our company so bad because the pay was significantly higher than her old company, plus this would greatly help her pay off her bills. I rarely indulge her when she confides in me about her marital trouble because i'm honestly not a good fit to give her advice on that, I just make sure to let her know na people are not her enemy, her partner is not her enemy, and she should give them the chance.

Ang sad lang kasi she never gave me the chance and immediately assumed I was mad at her for having to pick up after friend B at work, when really I was just working on autopilot with all the heavy baggage I was already carrying on my own. Besides, post partum is a lot, I could go longer not letting her know about my dad's diagnosis, or my own head going to shit.

Pero turns out, friend B and HR representative has already been harboring ill-will towards me. A few more months after that incident, friend B has been making it harder for me to do my work. So one day I snapped, everything got to me.

And this got the attention of our management and our US team. 

I'm not one to complain pero I've had enough. We got a mediation meeting happen, umiyak si friend B in front of me accusing me of making her feel like she was indebted to me when all the time she was in the company, I've been focusing on my work and helping clean up whatever work she messed up just so our Co-founder wouldn't get mad at her even further. During that mediation though, it was clear that HR representative was very biased towards friend B in the process, and management even found more instances where HR representative was breaking company protoc

This lead to her and friend B being put under PIP and me let off with a warning for acting unbecoming of myself at work.

After that I simply grey rocked them both. 

I simply cut off my friendship with B, a 4 year friendship down the drain. We were so close that I even let her stay for weeks in my apartment when she and her family would fight. So close that I missed a day of work because I ran around town buying them groceries and medicine when I found out their house got cordoned after she got COVID during the pandemic. I couldn't handle the disrespect.

The worst thing about this all is si HR Representative pa ang galit sa akin? Why? We don't know. 

Feel ko mas nagagalit siya when I grey rock her. When I stay out of her way. Do whatever she says. Be the bigger person and just not give in to her taunts.

She's come to a point na even when friend B was already let go of the company, she would stoop so low as to rally all the new hires against me before even getting to know me.

Sobrang petty din niya, I got hospitalized for a week nung November for dengue, and lets be honest my mental health probably made it even worse, I barely get hospitalized. Our management was so worried and tasked her to send fruits my way, but when she found out that close friend M has been dropping by to see me after work, walang dumating. Kahit apple juice.

Now to the PIP part, aware naman yung management na ganun yung treatment nya sa akin. Just this December pinag WFH ako indefinitely to somehow protect me from the hostility of the situation, work no longer felt safe for me, and I'm p sure bumaba ang performance ko with the treatment I've been getting at work. Yung US team nalang talaga yung nagtetreat sakin as human, as well as close friend M,and yung country manager namin.

The higher ups think it's because HR rep is jealous of my friendship with close friend M, but i don't get that.

I'm not the one who forces close friend M to hang out with me, she just wants to and di naman ako tumatanggi if it means I get to go out of the house. We've even invited her out to join us before until she stopped coming on her own accord.

&#x200B;

I just feel like it's very unfair na I'm under PIP for basically being bullied at work. I never confront them because they're all older than me by significant years, ayoko di naman ng gulo.

&#x200B;

What's more unfair is ang dami ko pang opportunities sa company and HR representative is just paying off debt she owes to the company before resigning. I have so much to lose while she doesn't.

&#x200B;

Yan lang hahahah idk where I'm going with this, unfair na I was handed a PIP when the only memo I've ever earned in my whole career is for losing an office key 5 years ago in my old company.",2,3,0.6,Rant üò°,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/19eod4a/ako_yung_na_agrabyado_pero_ako_yung_nalagay_sa_pip/,19eod4a
2024-01-24 16:55:49,Text-only,My mom is giving me the silent treatment and sinabing kinamumuhian ko daw paghiram niya sakin ng pera.,"My mom is a businesswoman and my pops a seafarer. I (F21) used to work with a monthly salary less than 20k. While I was working, she would constantly ask to borrow money from me and may pa ""ibibigay ko sayo agad bukas/this week"" siya. I would willingly let her even when I know she won't stick to her words. My salary money was used for many things like my rent, school, meals, etc. I was trying to be independent so she can use my dad's allotment for my siblings. This went on for months and even prior to only having school allowance pa from my papa, she'd also borrow my money. I know some of her money problems. Loans everywhere and at least 2 demand letters I've seen. I was also publicly shamed by a former friend on fb kase may utang daw mama ko sa mama niya and I didn't know about this utang. Her loans? My dad is unaware.

So last week, she borrowed some of my allowance given by my pops and again, said she'd return it the next day. Ending is, she still hasn't. And earlier this day she talked me into asking for more allowance from my pops kase di pa daw nya ma-reimburse yung pera kong hiniram nya. I said ""no"". Context is, I'll be using that allowance this week na. Then, we had a conversation about salaries and she told me this: ""dapat lang magpahiram ka sakin ng pera mo kase pinapahiram kita pag ikaw yung walang pera"".  

Isn't it valid to feel disappointed, hurt, and annoyed at the same time? How would you reply to her if it were u in my shoes? 

I replied about how my then salary was barely enough and how she'd always call me days prior to borrowing my money shouldn't be her thing. I made it a point that she's expecting too much from me already, how much more if when I finally have the right career? She got mad and also said ""sge di na ako manghihiram sayo nang pera, kino-compare mo ko sa ibang nagtatrabaho na mga kapatid lang ginagastusan pero ikaw yung mama mo naman ang nanghihiram"". And then gave me the silent treatment. My mind just went blank for seconds. Has she not realized that she's also treating me like her ""arawan"" loans na pwede lang din kung bukas na yung collection (!??). 

The thing is she doesn't understand how this negatively affects me. I have bigger dreams like studying abroad. But I always get stuck din in between her problems. And shouldn't major money talk be for adults? I think pops finally needs to know of her problems. I DO want to give back to my parents when the time comes but now parang ayaw ko na. I'm thinking na it'd be better to lie to her about my money. I can no longer think of how to deal with her or even make her understand kase di naman siya nakikinig when I try to make a point. How do I set clear boundaries?

2024-01-24 19:42:58,Text-only,"Accused, yet eventually pursued to be the other woman of a high ranking officer","I, F26, is accused of being the other woman of a high ranking officer. Nakakanginig yung part na this rumor is spreading like a wild fire burning me to ashes. 

This all started when I got the regularly position, and had particularly special treatments from our boss. Automatically when I joined their office, I got privileges (I admit) and doing his dirty works. He invites me with almost all his whereabouts. As a newbie to their office I have no choice but to affirm kasi work-related naman - as of my perspective.

I NEVER ASKED EVEN A SINGLE ONE OF THOSE.

I've been working really hard since my first day of work as a contractual in other office connected to the boss I mentioned above. That, paved my way on getting my regularization.

Yet, because of how that boss treat me in the office, rumors began to swarm about us having a relationship. Gossips then reached to our boss' end and he provocatively announced during our meeting that all rumors are false and I am just competent worker the office needed most.

Here's the catch.

He became more and more stingy towards me. He even invited me personally going out, the first time he did this I was shocked that we were alone - I just let it slip out kasi wala talagang malice sa akin this is all just part of the work, I supposed.

I realized that everything was wrong when he asked me about my lovelife. Upon confirming my status as single, it must have became his affirmation of my availability to be his. Yuck. He  begun saying delusional things as if he is my boyfriend.

RIGHT THERE AND THEN, HE CONFESSED THAT HE LIKES ME AND WANTS US TO BE REAL ü§¢

That became a trauma. I cried for several hours, asked my friends for advices. I then decided to ask for help from my previous boss.

I cried my heart out in front of her and asked for help. She was furious of course and took the concern personally with my boss at that time. After days, I was transferred back to my previous office. 

I thought the storm was over, until two weeks ago. He demanded me to return to his office as his executive secretary. He said that he will publish an official order for this matter. My now-boss still defended me and made sure I will be in a safe working space. An Official Order was published last monday confirming that I'll still remain with my now-boss' team.

The plot didn't stopped there yet, mukhang may i-kikwento pa ako. I just need to resolve this first.

Nakapasa ako sa intial and final interview and had already signed a job offer. Nakapag down na ako sa apartment & mags start na lang sana sa work ng feb.

However, naging hesitant yung isang higher up dahil nalaman na I am diagnose with Bipolar I. Nalaman nila ito dahil sa pre-employment medical exam. Ang worry ng HR and owner is the working environment and how I will handle rejections. (tinawagan naman niya ako how I work and handle stress)

Sa interview, di ko minention ang condition ko dahil wala naman silang naitanong about that and I think, di naman necessary to know that kasi given na yung job description & nature of work, I know na I can do it naman. Rather than seeing my abilities and skills, naging hesitant sila ng dahil sa condition ko... it sucks... yess.. but by the end of the day- work is work and syempre as someone who goes to monthly therapy- i learned how to cope.

I'm doing the associate tasks at the same time ginagawa ko din yung tasks ko as a supervisor. Where I work, ako na top ng department namin. Lagi akong OT ng more or less 3 hours a day.

Nung tumutulong ako sa associate sasabihin sana nag-associate na lang ako. Unahin ko daw yung mga dapat kong gawin. Nung hindi ako tumulong sasabihin wala akong initiative.

Nagbibigay naman sila ng feedback na ginagamit ko for the betterment ko and maging mas smooth yung flow ng department. Di ko alam kung saan niya hinuhugot yung mga ""sinabi"" daw sa kanya. Either my associates lie or gumagawa lang siya ng issue.

Pinagawa niya ako ng guidelines and procedure. Sabi daw sa kanya sinabi ko daw na aayusin ko muna yun bago ko ayusin yung department. I never said that. And why tf will I say that?

so as the other staff checks my documents, the other lady told the 3 to 4 guys na they are scheduled for an interview next week so i was expecting na yun din sasabihin sa akin after i-check ang documents ko pero natapos na ang lahat, walang sinabi ng date ng job interview ko. what gives me more ick ay may namention yung other lady na ""sabihan ko na lang si 'SIR' na nagpasa na kayo"" so grabe napa sideeye talaga ako. 

both of us have Engineering degrees and unlicesed but if you will compare our job experience, i think i have way better experince naman. hindi sa pagbubuhat ng sarili kong bangko but i have a almost two years experince sa dalawang construction companies and a job experince sa isang environmental NGO na which is very suited for the job position by the way since the position i am applying for is agriculture-related and requires to immerse in the community. isang beses palang ako nagtake ng board kahit 2020 pa ako nag grad. reason: need talaga kumayod. last boards na nagfail ako ay i was so mentally unstable kasi 50/50 non ang medical condition ng father ko after ng accident. 

wala lang. i am just disappointed. i can def look for other job position but (1) nakakahinayang rin kasi yung sahod kasi di mo yun madaling mahanap sa mga private companies, (2) need ko din talaga ng pera since kailangan pampagamot ng father ko and (3) ilang katulad ko pa kaya ang hindi nabigyan ng chance sa isang job vacancy ng mga government offices¬† dahil sa padrino system.

Nashow-cause order ng halos lahat sa departamento sa amin, dahil nahuli ng pinakaboss namin ung natutulog na empleyado, so akala namin siya lang, pocha halos 95% ng tao nabigyan ng show cause order, pero hindi na namin yon minamatter and dinidiin yung empleyado na iyon.

Nakalagay doon sa show cause order na NEGLECT OF DUTY kami, despite na may output naman kaming nilabas, so ung mga assistant boss namin, willing kaming tulungan sa department namin at nagpatawag ng mga meetings. Maraming beses kami nang mineeting pero etong dalawang meeting na ito ung tumatak talaga dahil sa kanya.

2nd meeting namin with the assistant boss, normal na usap lang na bakit ganon and explain naman kami na ginagawa naman po ung report namin, with matching evidence naman. (Tho isang specific duty lang naman pinakita and nakita, hindi pa kasama ung other scheduled duties) na walang nangyaring neglect of duty sa mga nadamay. 

After non, may inutos siya na, ikaw chief, may ganito naman palang problema, dapat tulungan mo ung tao mo, nirereport naman nila ung insidente sa iyo, bakit di nagagawan ng paraan? Ung ibang report, pa-generate naman. 

 ETO UNG LINYANG TUMATAK SA AMING LAHAT. 

""BAKIT AKO?""

Sinupalpal siya ng assistant boss na ANO BA? TAO MO YAN AH? TULUNGAN MO NAMAN YAN AT MGA NAKAYUKO NA.

""YES PO.""

Ginawa naman ung report, pero feel namin na napilitan lang siya sa pag-gawa non. After ginawa ung report. Except kay chief, sabay-sabay na kami na nagsubmit ng explanation sa Internal Department. Saktong dumaan ung lawyer doon na assistant boss din namin at may idea siya sa nangyari and kinausap kami ulit. Ginuide naman kami sa paano ung paglalagay sa Show Cause Order namin, and nagexplain naman kami kung ano ung nangyari and sabi niya, revise ninyo to, so okay lang naman yon para atleast mahelp kami. 

Habang nag-meeting kami, nag-submit na din pala siya ng response sa show-cause and pinatawag din siya. Tumabi siya sa akin and pinakinggan na ung mga sinabi namin.

Alam ninyo ung body movement niya na galaw ng galaw, hindi mapalagay, kinakamot ulo lagi like bruh ganyan ka pala and halos kinokontra lahat ng sinasabi nung lawyer.

Then sinabihan din siya na ikaw chief, tulungan mo sila sa pagrerevise kasi malalagot yang mga tao mo na yan. 

THEN GUESS WHAT, SHE SAID THE LINE AGAIN.

""BAKIT AKO?""

Kahit katabi ko boss ko, napatingin na lang ako sa isang katabi ko eh.

Hindi nagsalita ung lawyer sa kanya, nung nandon pa kami. Nagsalita siya nung pinadisperse kami at pinaiwan siya.

""Ano ka ba, ikaw ang boss ng mga ito, alam mo bang subject for dismissal yan mga yan tapos kinontra mo pa ako?""

Sabi nung chief namin: Joke lang po.

YEAH JOKE LANG PO. JOKE LANG NA MAWALAN KAYO NG 95% NA TAO? JOKE LANG DIN PALA NA NAGKAKAIYAKAN NA LAHAT DITO TAPOS JOKE PA DIN PALA?

2024-01-23 22:29:29,Text-only,Possible Scam Agencies,"Hello! I saw this reddit rant na sumikat sa FB na yung topic is about sa Okoy and thief na ka-workmate so I had the courage to also rant and ask you guys what I experienced.

Meron naba dito naka-experience ng pinagmedical ng agency and nagbigay ng assurance na sure na daw na matatanggap ka sa work or company kung saan ka nila ie-endorse so pinagmedical na nila which amounting to P1,020 pesos. Pinagpasa rin ng requirements and then finally nabigay mo na yung endorsement letter sa company tapos sasabihin sayo na tatawagan ka nalang daw after ma evaluate ng documents and resume mo. In the end hindi ka matatawagan so it means hindi ka natanggap. 

I feel like na-scam ako since hindi nila tinanggap yung medical ko na 3 months old and meron daw silang affiliated medical clinic kung saan doon lang magpapa-medical. Ang theory ko is may porsyento itong agency sa medical clinic kada magpapadala sila ng tao na magpapamedical kahit hindi naman matatanggap sa company in the end. I also talked to other applicants which is same kame ng nangyare after interview sa company, sinabi lang rin ng HR ng company is tatawagan nalang daw sila pero since hindi ako natawagan, I doubt na natawagan sila.

&#x200B;

This could be a scam, a big one since marami akong kasabay na magpamedical na galing rin sa agency na yun, I estimate atleast 30 plus people were there. Tapos P1000 plus yung bayad kada person. Of course I could be wrong so Im asking you fellow workers if nangyari naba to sa inyo because it feels so wrong to take advantage to people na naghahanap ng work para magkapera pero gumastos pang medical pero hindi naman nagkawork.

2024-01-21 07:31:23,Text-only,Getting tired of sassy useless nepotism hire and unpaid OT pays.,"Sorry sa mahabaang rant T\_T  
For context, I work in a warehouse that houses parts boxes and newly produced parts for printers. Wala kaming pasok sana kahapon dahil may fiesta pero pinapasok ako para ayusin ang isang area. No problem, pasok = pera. Pagdating ko sa trabaho, may narinig ako na may nagsabi ""Bakit ayaw magtanong kung may pasok."" Buti na lang at may nagsalita pabalik na pinapapasok nga kami. Naabutan ko pa na pa-out na yung NH. Ang NH na ito ay nandoon lang dahil ang kapatid niya ay nagtratrabaho sa molding company na pinagtratrabahuhan ng warehouse namin. Lagi siyang nakaub-ob at nagpapahinga kapag walang request habang ang mga lalaking warehouse staff ang nagsosort at nagtataas/nagbaba ng mga boxes para sa kanya. Kapag rush pa ang mga boxes na request, tinatapon niya lang sa gilid ang mga basura at ako din maglilinis. Sinisigurado ko na palaging maayos ang area ko at sorted out at naitaas bago ako mag-out. Talaga lang tambak ang area niya ng mga boxes dahil kahit magsort ay hindi niya na ginagawa kaya yung area na dapat sana ay nagagamit namin ay natambakan ng mga boxes. Kaya nga ako pinapasok para maclear namin ang area na iyon. Narinig ko na lang siya magsabi na ""Porket may atm ka na, 'di ka na magwawalis"". Nakakagalit. Tuwing nightshift, naglalakad lakad ako para antukin at nakikita ko area niya na makalat at hindi pa sorted habang siya nakaub-ob sa tabi. Tumahimik na lang ako at sa isip ko, ""Malaki ang sasahurin ko sa dami ng OT ko"".  


Guess what? Dumating ang payslip ko at sa 65 hours na OT ko (24 hours ang hindi pa nabayaran noong December 1-15 at 41 hours ang OT ko nitong January 1-15, pero technically 37 hours and 47 minutes dahil hindi pa inapprove ang 3 hours at may butal ako na 13 hours) ay 46 hours at 47 minutes lang ang naapprove sa akin. Parang akong masusuka. I've never had a panic attack in a long while. About 16 hours ang hindi nabayaran. Kulang na ako sa tulog na, for the first time in my life, nagkaka-eye bags na ako. Tapos hindi pa nababayaran ang OT? Nakausap ko ang kasama ko at simula nga daw mahire ang accounting na iyon, lagi daw may problema sa sahod. Bakit hindi nila ayusin at tingnan kung anong ginagawa ng Payroll Staff? Busy ba sila na hindi maayos ng maganda ang sahod?  


Nagrarant kasi ako dahil andaming chechebureche na kailangan pagdaanan tapos ganito nangyayari. May biometric kami. May payroll site na pinagfifile-an ng mga OT na kailangan pang i-approve ng Warehouse Manager. Tinatawag pa namin ang mismong payroll staff. TAPOS, DUMATING ANG SAHOD NA KULANG. May mga kasama ako na nagsasabi na malaki na nga iyon, 'wag ko na daw masyadong isipin at maihahabol pa. WTF? So, bigay na lang ng libreng manpower?!?  


Pasensiya na sa pagrarant pero talagang nakakapagod. Ang sabi nga ay isang strike na lang sa DOLE at mapapasara na ang warehouse na iyon.

Si **Nag-resign,** bale last day niya January 15 (sinadya talaga for cut-off para buong sweldo backpay). But prior to that, dumating na yung kapalitan niya January 4. Kaya hetong si **Nag-Resign**, siyempre you know the drill, nagtu-turn over siya rito kay **Pumalit** sa kanya. Beterano itong si **Nag-Resign** kaya nakakapagtakang aalis siya, lagpas dekada na siya sa company. But even though ganu'n, ang dami niyang hindi naasikaso or mga pending task na umabot na ng taon dahil may nakalagay na 2022 pa sa turnover files niya. Medyo nakakainis lang kasi sa tagal niya, umabot siya sa ganu'n na hindi niya talaga inasikaso na.

Si **Pumalit Sa Nag-Resign**, pumasok siya January 4. So far, so good. Ang swerte niya kung tutuusin, bagay na hindi niya alam kasi maraming nakaabang sa kanya ng pera. By the way, yung mga pending task na tinutukoy ni **Nag-Resign** pera 'yon para sa **Pumalit Sa Nag-Resign**, alam ko napaliwanag sa kanya, pero ewan ko ba. Nakakwentuhan ko pa si **Pumalit Sa Nag-Resign**, kasama mag-coffee break, kwentuhan, binibigyan ko ng tips. Sinabi ko yung cons sa work, pero sobrang shallow lang talaga. Tsaka para sa kanya, ""Wala lang daw 'yon. Sanay na siya. Dine-deadma lang niya."" Basically, hindi niya masyadong dinadamdam yung cons na sinabi ko base sa mga sagot niya rin sa kwentuhan.

Lumilipas ang panahon, siyempre ayon na nga, tinuturuan ni **Nag-Resign** si **Pumalit Sa Nag-Resign**. Naririnig at nakikita namin kung paano niya turuan, okay naman talaga. Even Manager, Boss and Colleagues, which is kami 'yon, tinatanong namin siya na kung may tanong siya at concerns, huwag siya mahiya. Kasi hindi naman sarado mga utak namin knowing si **Nag-Resign** at mga pending tasks niya.

Wala na si **Nag-Resign** by Tuesday kasi nga hanggang January 15 lang siya. Kaya naman si **Pumalit Sa Nag-Resign** totoong trabaho na talaga. Pero ito na nga ang **plot twist**, si **Pumalit Sa Nag-Resign** by Thursday, 3rd day simula nung umalis na si **Nag-Resign** biglang nagpasa na rin ng **Resignation**. Sobrang daming nainis kasi ang daming sinayang at ang dami niyang inabala. Each Department Assistant Head, in-orient siya, siyempre kumain ng oras 'yon. Yung mga Manager na sobra kung mag-orient which I should know kasi naranasan ko kung paano sila mag-orient, ang sobrang okay talaga.

Tapos biglang umalis? Alam mo kung ano yung nakakainis? Yung ang dami niya pang ebas nung nakakakwentuhan ko pa siya, tapos malaman-laman pa namin, nagde-demand siya ng ibang gawain, gusto niya yung gawain ng isa niyang kasabayan na bago, kung pwede palit daw sila, yung wala ka pa nga napapatunayan, pero kung makapag-demand ka sa gusto mo maging trabaho mo. Naiinggit siya kasi yung isang kasabayan niya, wala masyadong ginagawa pero kasi wala naman din tasks du'n at walang kita rin du'n, basically I am talking incentives and/or commission here. Kaya nga sabi ko, ang swerte niya kung tutuusin. Para siyang yung mga fresh graduate na ang demanding, wala pa naman napapatunayan, resign agad, ina-anxiety, ganito, ganyan.

So, ito na nga, Friday na. January 19. Galit na galit mga Manager namin, nagra-rant na sa area dahil sa istorbong ginawa niya na sana nung nakikita na niyang tinuturuan pa lang siya ni **Nag-Resign** at nakikita niya yung sandamakmak na pending tasks nito, sumuko na siya. Nakailang tanong kasi sa kanya, kasi ganu'n talaga sa mga bago at sobrang open ng boss namin sa concerns, kasi naramdaman ko siya nung bago ako, sinasabi ko talaga napapansin ko at mga concern ko agad bilang baguhan nu'n. Anyway, ayon na nga, Friday January 19. Ito na yung **shocking twist**. Hindi na tatanggap ng new employee as replacement ni **Nag-Resign** at **Pumalit Sa Nag-Resign**. Kaya naman, yung pending task nilang dalawa, hinati sa mga kasama nila at kabilang ako, si **Napag-iwanan Ng Trabaho.**

Sa totoo lang, wala naman sanang kaso talaga. Ang problem kasi, wala siyang proper turnover. Imagine, nasa pag-a-adapt pa lang si **Pumalit Sa Nag-Resign**, obviously hindi niya pa gamay, in fact, hindi niya nga na-gets pala yung mga tinuro ni **Nag-Resign** sa kanya, nung Thursday lang din namin nalaman, kaya nga siya nag-resign kasi hindi niya na-gets din.

Biglang atang na lang sa'min ng mga pending task, biglaan lahat nung Friday, 3PM siya nangyari, muntikan pa ko hindi makipag-coffee break sa tadtad ng inquiries. Bigla niya lang pinasa yung contact details ko, and voila! Sunod-sunod na. Wala man lang siyang explaination sa kung ano gagawin namin sa pending, basta nag-email siya. Which is we don't understand basta table of details siya ng pending task niya pero wala kang mauunawaan sa **Remarks** kasi nga either blank or just some random information lang din bagay na walang indication kung ano 'yon.

**Ano rant ko? Nasira weekends ko ngayon.** Supposedly, aalis dapat ako. Pero dahil sa nangyari, buong araw akong nagtrabaho sa restday ko. Simula 9AM na gumising ako kanina hanggang ngayong 12:34AM na tina-type ko 'to, hindi pa rin ako tapos.

So kapag probi, hindi naman to required pero kapag regular ka na, kasama na to sa KPI.. ang pagiging ""reliever""... ikaw papasok sa  naka VL. Walang sapilitan pero keep in mind na kasama yun sa KPI. 

Maganda yung company na to pero I find this so BS. Fini flex pa nila na wala silang day-off dahil naging reliever sila. & now na bago ako rito, ineencourage nila na gawin ko yun dahil ang laki ng hatak sa KPI and syempre , OT pay mo rin to. 

Almost perfect sakin tong company. Siguro in the future, magiging reliever din ako pero baka once or twice a month lang.

I know kailangan ko ng pera pero ayoko ma-stress parati during day off na papasukan ko ung duty na un kahit na dapat pahinga ko that day.

Yung workload, yes hindi mabigat .. hindi ka lagi nakababad sa laptop pero kahit na. Masaya pa rin na during day off , sulitin mo.

Pero honestly, overall, 10 years na ko nagtatrabaho... hindi na ko takot sa grading, sa KPI. Basta hindi tinatanggal & nagta trabaho naman ako ng maayos.. kahit hindi 100% KPI ko.. ok lang sakin.

2024-01-19 12:15:46,Text-only,2 months palang felt like quitting na,"Bagong salta. Advertising/Publishing industry nga pala nature ng work ko.

No'ng una excited pako, kasi after more than 5 years makakalipat na. Walang issue previous company, naging comfty nako, masaya environment, dekalidad leadership, madami nang naging friends dahil sa engagement activities, tadtad ng trainings which is an advantage, upskilling din kasi. 'yun lang, yung sahod. Aminin natin, kelangan maka keep up sa living expenses yung sahod natin. Kaya ayon, nagdecide ako lumipat for a greener pasture.

Ngayon dalawang buwan nako pero yung pakiramdam ko parang isang taon nakong empleyado dahil sa hassle na naranasan at nararanasan ko. Wala akong kabatch na nahire. Utay utay sila maghire, ayon wala akong NHO, hindi ako familiar sa mga policies nila na ilang beses nang nagbago base sa mga memo's na narereceive ko sa email. Hindi pa naman ako entitled sa mga leaves ko keri.   


WALA DIN AKONG PROCESS TRAINING. Naintindihan ko yung expectation sakin nung ininterview ako. Tinanggap ko yung challenge. Ang hindi ko inexpect ee isasalpak ako sa trabaho na wala akong idea kung pano gawin. Oo, I have the skills and experience since I came from the same industry, pero magkakaiba ang process ng bawat company ee, iba iba din yung best practice. Entirely different business din tong pinasukan ko ang well aware yung employer ko sa nature ng product nung dati kong employer.   


1st week, papunta punta ako onsite na walang ginagawa, walang scheduled training, pero tinatanon ako ng manager anong ginagawa ko.??? Come 3rd day nung 1st week ko, nagtanong nako anong plans for me, training sched kung pwede paki block sa calendar ko para alam ko ieexpect. They proudly responded to me ""walang training plans."" 

2nd week, siguro dahil na din sa initiation ko, nagkaron bigla ng plans. Ok may idea nako sa overview. Pero tools, reporting, and jargon wala pa rin. Naging patient pa din ako. 

3rd week, di natuloy yung scheduled training, ipinasok ako sa ibang training na wala naman kinalaman sa role ko. Sa loob loob ko, sige na lang kesa wala akong gawin. 2 days lang yon. After nung 2 days training ulit, pero same lang sa training ko nung 2nd week. 

4th week, nag iimerse nako sa production, nagkipagkilala nako sa teammates bilang nag iisang new hire, dito pinilit ko nalang isipin na baka mas matuto ako pag ginagawa ko na yung mismong work. May natutunan naman ako, nalaman ko na pasikot sikot ng tools. Kaso may kulang pa din, hindi ko pa din talaga alam pano iprocess yung ibang request. Ang naiipprocess ko lang kasi lagi corrections. By the way walang proper delegation yung projects. Kung sino lang maisipang pagbigyan yun yung bibigyan ng task. Walang ownership from start to finish sa projects. Pwedeng ikaw magsisimula, pero iba ang tatapos ganon.   


Ayon nag 2nd month na ko't lahat ganyan pa din scenario. Not everyone was willing to help a newbie. Bad case pa sakin kasi expected to take a higher responsibility ako bilang co-lead. Another bad case is yung team lead namin walang alam sa process, so how am I gonna take a higher responsibility when my TL can't, si utos lang siya. and ako as co-lead will take instructions from the lead. Andami kong suggestions how to better implement changes and processes, pero it's falling on deaf ears because it will incur costs.   


This gets worse. Wala pa yung environment and gist of the kind of leadership pa lang yan nashare ko. Reklamador ba ko? Siguro. I can adjust sa process and best practices, matagal na ko sa corporate industry to not to know ang mga standard na kalakaran. Pero ang lala ng culture shock ko. Kaya sa mga nakakahanap ng swak na company para sakanila, sanaol. Baka I'm just bad at making decisions din. Rant lang. share your opinions, pero don't invalidate my struggle.

2024-01-16 21:33:38,Text-only,Refusal to Accept Additional Work,"I've been searching the web for any information regarding my current predicament:

Recently, my department was forced to have a ""re-organization"" due to the resignation of one of our members. So basically, one position was ""dissolved"" because they transferred the one assigned to that dissolved position to another role, however, the duties and responsibilities are not dissolve. Based on a close door discussion within some of our heads, it was decided to give those to me without even discussing it with my immediate superior to know whether i can accommodate the additional tasks. They just informed my immediate superior as an FYI basis, without discussing the reason why they chose me to shoulder this additional burden.

They set a meeting to discuss this change, at this point im still clueless to the decision of adding some tasks to me. My immediate superior talked to me one on one prior to the cascade of re-organization to inform me about this change of scope to my work. My position was that I cannot take additional workload and why did they think that I can handle additional workload when in fact neither me nor my immediate superior was consulted about it. The only reason they gave was the other person that they consider was already full.

What happened that day was the heads had a ""pre-meeting"" prior the discussion with us. My immediate superior raised my concern in that pre-meeting. So, what transpired was they parked the discussion of my added roles for another day. They asked to prepare a TMS to check whether I can accommodate the additional tasks.

My concern is that, despite my TMS showing that I cannot accommodate additional tasks, knowing our Senior head, they can position it that they have the full right to change my work load and not cooperating would merit willfull insubordination.

We will be having a discussion tomorrow and will i have strong legal support if I refuse to accept the additional tasks?

To add, there are other personnel that they choose but it seemed that they are insistent into me taking the additional roles as they don't asked other members to do TMS after they made aware of my stand that I cannot accommodate additional task.

Hoping someone can help me. Will highly appreciate if you can aldo help in providing specific legal provisions and actual case study as I was not able to find any similar case nor legal provision on the basis of refusal to take additional responsibility.

UPDATE: Just to update everyone na nakabasa ng hinaing ko. I already found another job with higher position and compensation. So parang blessing in disguise na din tong nangyari since na force ako to seek job outside my current and yun nga napaganda pa. 

As for the events related to my post. What i found out was that kaya pala ganun ang approach ng bagong head namin (internally promoted) because he felt na underloaded ako. His reasoning kung bakit gusto nya ako ioverload (1) when they asked me to cover for someone, i managed to do cover that person so sa kanya madami akong idle time to be able to do that (2) hindi daw nya ako masyado ramdam sa section na hinahawakan nya. 

To be fair my immediate superior and one of the LT defended me outright, na hindi totoo yung mga conclusions nya (sila din nagfefeedback sa akin ng mga nangyayari sa LT meetings nila kaya aware ako sa mga napaguusapan about me).

To clarify yung mga issues nya:

Issue 1: Nagawa kong magcover because at home nagtatrabaho and in werkends nagtatrabaho pa ako to cover kung ano man di ko ginawa dahil may urgent na need gawin like magcover ng ibang empleyado. And besides, this is work related, why is he not questioning other employees na nagagawang umattend ng kape at tsismisan sessions, bday bash, non-work related extra curricular activities.

Issue 2: The problem is hindi naman ako reporting sa kanya, so lahat ng activities ko is reported sa immediate superior ko. Later i found out na during editing ng monthly reports, tinanggal pala nung dating boss namin yung update ko since detailed update sya na hindi na masyado need ng top management since company metrics na lang pinepresent nila. And natigil pa yung group monthly meeting nila in which normally dun sya nadidiscuss. Lastly, for the past 2 yrs wala naman sya niraraise na issue about my output so why now, had he raised this earlier we could have made an alignment of expectations. 

So they officialized the additional role (walang adjustment sa compensation) but, through the help of my immediate superior we managed to convince the top management na i-spread out yung responsibilities sa iba ibang tao. But at this point I'm just buying my time to secure another job. Btw, alam ng immediate superior ko yung plans ko to resign kahit maayos yung sitwasyon since it's the values na ng next department head yung concern ko na I don't want to be in constant battle with the department head just because my prejudice na sya sa akin. Recently, since hindi nagsucceed yung plan nya to overload me the first time,, nagdevice na naman sya ng bagong scheme para ioverload na naman ako which failed again.

Tsismis na lang: isa pang hinala namin bukos sa unang dalawa nyang issues, ay dahil mas malaki sweldo ko kesa sa mga ka-chummy nya na pantay lang ng position ko (external hire ako). Kasi nalaman ko na lahat ng external hire someway or another may issue sya or pinepressure nya to take more responsibilities (not even explicitly discussing with them kung ano ba expected nya, na parang ang dating eh dahil mataas ang sweldo namin need nya makitang nagpapak@mat@y kami sa trabaho).

May lesson ba na dapat matutunan? Di ko din sure, pero eto mga narealize ko sa nangyari:

1. Make good connections. I managed to land a better job faster through the help of my former superior. Not expecting na in less than a month makakahanap agad ako ng lilipatan.
2. Know your worth. Kung di yun makita ng management, look somewhere na makikita ang worth mo. Di natin deserve to be in a constant battle within our own department. Nakakastress na nga yung interaction with outside the department kaya wag mo na idagdag.

2024-01-16 18:37:14,Text-only,Usage of Service Incentive Leaves upon resignation.,"Hello everyone. Just want to seek advice regarding my current situation. I gave my resignation last Nov. 2023 to my company. Effectivity date is until end of Jan. 2024. The reason is I will enter my masteral degree which started last week. 

I still have leave credits. I have to be absent at least two working days a week until the month end. I filed my paid leave credits on those days but the HR said I can't use all of them (6) and will only be allowed to use/paid with at least two since ""the leave credits are computed as pro-rated for the the whole year"" 

Is this a correct practice?

2024-01-16 13:36:55,Text-only,How can I demand my Salary?,"How to demand for additional pay?

Hi.

So, I am working as operations assistant.

During interview I asked the scope of work and they said it is processing logistics and keeping up with the production. Typically what I usually do is forward orders to the production floor and prepare all the items for deliveries and booked for pick ups.

I do not mind doing some graphic post, but recently. I was asked to make a catalog of all our products, answer inquiries in our SNS.

My salary is Php500.00/day (provincial rate) and I am no work no pay. That Php500 is for the operations assistant. Now, lately, I noticed my tasks are getting more and more and it is not part of my job description.

Graphics? Catalog? Product Shoot? Aren't  those work for Marketing and PR?

My boss added Php500 on my weekly pay when I started replying to our SNS. I do not mind replying and all, but after working hours and during my rest day (Sundays), I do not reply immediately because I believe that it is not my priority as my working hours is done, but I noticed that my boss is getting naggy when I do not reply immediately or if I missed something during those times.

Things are getting exhausting. I want to demand for extra pay for the extra work, but I do not know how to. I like what I do (packing and all), but the extra tasks is making me feel exhausted.

Mind you, I worked half day on last Dec 24th and Dec 31st, they only pay me Php250/day for that. I didn't receive any pakunswelo de bobo. It just disappointing. 

I am planning to resign, but I still do care about how they will do things if I left, and the location of my work is quite ideal another factor why i do not want to leave. Hahahaha

Anyway to summarize. Here's  what I've been doing for my Php500.00/day and a no work no pay job:
‚Ä¢ ALL OPERATIONS
‚Ä¢ CUSTOMER SUPPORT
‚Ä¢ MARKETING

Felt like I am running my business yet I am not the one who earns the sales. ü•π

So ayun, on the third week I've requested to use my remaining 2 VL since sayang naman, then di ako pinapayagan since wala na daw matitira.

Nakakatawa tayong mga alipin ng salapi. Imbes na maging magkakampi tayo para labanan ang mga mayayamang kapitalista na uma-alipin sa atin, tayo pa ang nag-a-away-away at nagkakasalungat ng opinyon

Sobrang nakakatawa tayo, na ayaw natin sa mga unyon at nag-i-strike, ayaw natin sa collective bargaining at ayaw din natin sa mga job hoppers. Wala tayong class solidarity

Maybe I'm too harsh pero kung nababayaran lang ng tama ang mga empleyado ayon sa kanilang outputs at nabibigyan ng tamang benepisyo, wala namang magpapalipat-lipat ng trabaho 'diba? Sabi nga nila, kung kasipagan lang ang batayan ng sahod, dapat milyonaryo na ang mga magsasaka at mga labandera. Kung tutuusin, napakahirap na laging maghanap ng bagong trabaho at mag-aral ng bagong kaalaman

Isa ding tanong ko, sa napakaliit na P20,000 na kita ng ordinaryong mangggagawang Pilipino, tingin niyo, magkano ang katumbas na kita ng mga may-ari ng negosyo? For example lang, sa Accenture ka nagtatrabaho. Kung kumikita ka ng P30,000 a month, tingin mo, magkano 'yung totoong budget na binibigay ng client mo sa Accenture? Tingin mo ba, papayag 'yung Accenture na mas malaki ang cut mo?

Sa kakaunting mga kakilala ko na 6-digits o lampas pa ang sahod, wala NI ISA sa kanila ang tumagal ng 10 years sa work. Maaring merong iilan, pero either nepo-hire, nagtapos sa Big 4, madaming connections, o di kaya mga statistical outliers (sinwerte ng sobra). Siguro kung kasama kayo sa statistical outliers, then good for you. Kung ""good"" ang company mo, then good for you too. Pero job hopping is an advice that might not be valid for you, but for the other 99.999% of the working population

Pakialamero na kung pakialamero pero kung pagiging pakialamero at baliw ang mangarap ng mas magandang mundo, na lahat tayo ay matataas ang sahod at hindi kinakailangan na maging mga alipin ng salapi, mas maganda pang maging baliw na lang ako

Towards the end, we were just chatting about random stuff when Lea mentioned na she had been in the industry for more than 10 years na daw so I asked if she had met our team leaders, one of which is Amy. 

Lea said they were able to work on several projects before then she mentioned that never nya daw nakita na kumain si Amy and ang laki daw ng pinayat nya. Probably because of stress din daw.

Yung pananalita, cover letters, LinkedIn, resum√©s, portfolios, CEOs and HR. The more I am in this space, the more I'm starting to lose my mind.

Parang everything is just so self centered. I mean I get it I really do. I want a job too, for me. It's not like I care about a company wholeheartedly kaya ko gusto makapasok sakanila, right? That's the problem, sa interview pa lang you have to be enthusiastic about the job and the company. It all feels so superficial, but we have to do it to earn any sort of worth for ourselves. Tell me why an interviewer and I are engaged in a purely English phone call for a position that doesn't require me to speak, both of us trying to mask our Filipino accents, just to appease the corporate entity? I'm not trying to sound edgy but it's true.

And who would've thought na konting tweaks lang pala sa resum√© would land you an interview? No need to upskill in anything, no. In the interview just be better at talking and overselling yourself and you're all good. Just straight up lying is how everything works in corporate? Just be convincing? Hindi na ba nagbabase sa skills and competence ang position? Bentang benta ba sa interviewers kapag pinormahan mo sila ng social skills mo?

Not to mention marketing. You're telling me someone out there can convince me to buy dog sh!t because he has the marketing skills? I'm just slowly going insane the more I look into the behind the scenes. Does no one care about anyone anymore? Do we all only ""care"" about a person if they're generating income for the company? Where is the altruism in all this? Parang all the skills and personal growth na na-achieve at pinag-aralan mo, ang purpose lang pala non ay para makapag benta ka ng product?

Worst part is I know I have to play this game kung gusto ko maka-survive sa araw araw. I want to be successful too pero idk how I'll be competing with the most soulless marketing rep out there who has the ability to sell you a piece of fudgee bar worth your entire retirement fund, without feeling a thing.

Then here comes the other supervisor referring a ""friend"" (Brother of her husband) to join my team. The f*cked up thing here is I got bypass and directly referred  it to our manager (which is her office bestfriend) and passed the interview.

The referral was over-qualified, around 50's, previous work was a general manager of his own firm (bankrupt by pandemic). His experience is a lot but its not aligned with what we needed in the team.

My manager is now insisting to hire the referral to provide guidance to me and my team with his experience, since they see us as a young team (in short having a seniority).

Honestly I see it as a threat to my position but what I can't really sacrifice is the collaboration of my team right now. It would technically disrupt the workflow.

Anyway, I just want to ask your opinions on how I should go about this situation. For context, I am an overseas Filipino teacher and last year, I was the only Filipino left in our faculty. Months later, the school hired 4 more Filipinos and I was so happy kasi finally, may makakausap na ako! üò´üò≠ The previous Filipino co-workers that I had were nice people so I miss having that warm connection kaya I can‚Äôt believe a fellow Filipino would do this behind my back. ü•≤

I helped the 4 of them ease up in our workplace and also assisted them regarding visa matters, accommodation, transpo, work-related paperwork, etc., without thinking much about it. I want to give back and pass on the kindness and warmth that my previous Filipino co-workers did for me. Until, nag-away2 sila kasi iisa lang ang apartment nila. Their personalities just don‚Äôt click, ika nga. 1 of them eventually left the school and 3 of them stayed. Tapos nag-aaway na naman sila hanggang naging 2 (let‚Äôs call them Terry and Tina) vs 1 (Lenny) na. I clarified to both sides na I don‚Äôt want to get involved and to keep their misunderstandings between them. I told them to communicate and just be civil with one another if it‚Äôs beyond repair. I thought it worked. 

Fast forward a few months later, Lenny, yung nag-iisa na lang, spread gossip about me to other students that Terry, Tina and I daw are the reason why the teachers don‚Äôt like staying in the office. 

I was so surprised kasi ni hindi nga ako nangingialam sa away nila at sa kanya personally. And she just asked for my help 2 weeks ago about a non-work related stuff and I still helped her out thinking we‚Äôre okay. The students did not believe her crappy story and told me about it because they know my personality and attitude in and out of work. 

I also learned that she is hanging out with the other foreign teachers outside of work and I felt like the other foreigners won‚Äôt hang out with the rest of the Filipinos na lang kasi she had already tainted our reputations to them. 

The students told me that she (Lenny) asked them which teachers they like and the students replied that they prefer me (kasi siguro mas matagal na ako) and Terry, to which Lenny replied, ‚ÄúIf they are nice to you, well, not to us. The other teachers don‚Äôt like staying in the office because of them.‚Äù 

Nakakaput@ng1n4 talaga. I am hurt and disappointed kasi fellow Filipino pa ang gumagawa non and I haven‚Äôt done anything to her personally to make her react that way towards me.

Now, I am torn if I should tell the HR officer about her behavior because it‚Äôs making a rift between Filipinos and other foreign teachers or i-confront ko na lang talaga siya.

Regular 8-5 office job sa government, entitled ako sa mga benefits na almost the same sa regular (FYI Im not a permanent employee). Pero dahil ang dami kong workload at mag-isa ko lang gagawa nung trabaho, I found myself working during the holidays and weekend. Madalas pa akong mag-uwi ng trabaho just to accomplish my tasks on time and yet hindi ito nare-recognize ng management. Almost 4 years na ako sa institution na yun pero palagi akong hindi nakukuha for regular appointment sa government. Syempre you know naman pag sa government (palakasan). Sobrang mentally exhausted ako kasi kahit weekend may nagcha-chat sa messenger ko or sa phone number about sa work. Tapos hindi ako nauubusan ng trabahong ginagawa. Kaya napakadalang ko mag leave nun unless very important. Once na nag-leave ako, maiiipon lang nang maiipon ang trabahong iniwan ko. Unlike sa ibang department, they have colleagues who can take over their job pag absent si employee. I tried to subtly tell my concern sa supervisor ko pero yung pag-kuha ng assistant is not their priority. Tapos despite na nagpupuyat ako para matapos ang trabaho, they keep on pushing me to work faster. Indirectly nilang sinasabi na ""Nasaan na? Tapos na ba?"". May mga iba pang dahilan kung bakit ako nag-resign pero I dont want to disclose it any further. May ipon pa naman ako, naka reserve to pay my monthly bills. Since 12/23/23 unemployed na ako.

For me kaya nga yung isa yung tinanggap eh. Kasi nga BETTER. Kesyo nahahassle daw sila kasi nga ang tagal ng proseso tapos irereject lang JO. Sana daw di ako ganun.

Bakit daw xxx,xxx yung asking ko eh 29 lang daw ako. May pamilya daw ba akong binubuhay. Breadwinner daw ba ako. Etc? Eh yung asking ko pasok naman sa ads nila sa jobstreet.

Out of courtesy I just smiled and answered their questions professionally. If may questions or followups daw itext ko lang sila.

One week after, wala pading balita. So nagfollowup ako via text. No response.

After that, I assumed na wala na. Right after a week may JO nadin ako sa ibang company na mas ok na friendly mga HR. May start date nadin ako 

Tapos kahapon nagchat yung recruiter, may update na daw sa application ko. Dinedma ko lang kasi sobrang na off na ko sa interview, tapos hindi pa ko nireplyan 4 weeks ago. Kahit manlang sabihin na waiting for update. Wala eh. So hindi ko na nireplyan

Kanina tumawag yung HR manager, if open padin ba ako. I just said I followed up weeks ago and got no response thus i assumed na I did not get the role. And may JO nadin ako.

HR came back and said the hiring manager would not push thru hiring me kasi mag kaka salary imbalance sa team kasi puro home grown daw yung sa team.

2. Since nag aaccrue na nga kami ng SL and VL since day 1, nakapag accrue na kami ng 6.25 SL in total since nag start kami Aug 2023. Jan 2024 nag reset sya to 1.3 at ang explanation sa amin ay dapat talaga magrereset sya since di ginagamit. Ang nakakapag taka dun eh hindi naman namin pwede gamitin in the first place so talagang di sya magagamit. Question is again, tama ba yun or allowed po ba yung ganon?

Yun yung introduce ng office manager na nag interview sa akin at nakalagay sa contract. Kaya ko kinuha yung job offer kasi flexible yung oras ng pasok. Basta daw macomplete yung 8 hrs pwede na umuwi. Excluded ang lunch nun. 6 months na ako at regular na din. Pero nagreklamo tong Accounting Manager namin kasi late daw kami pumapasok like lagpas na ng 9AM pero di lagpas ng 9:30. I was like, ang pagkakainform sa akin ng OM namin na until 9:30 ang pasok. Tapos nagagalit sya na 5:45 umaalis na kami. Take note, halos araw araw yung lunch break namin hindi umaabot ng 1 hr. Kasi kapag 10 mins tapos na kami kumain, nagtratrabaho na ang lahat. Kasi kapag sinabi nila na kapag tapos na kumain, may pinapagawa na agad. 

Ang nakakainis lang sinabi nya sa pinakaboss na dapat 9AM ang pasok tas 6PM ang uwi. Okay, sya pinakahuli pumasok like manager sya e. okay din sya last na umuuwi. Pero gusto ko iopen-up sa kanila na yun yung sabi ng office manager e. Sino ba susundin ko sa kanila? 

Ang gusto ko mangyari, tanungin yung office manager na kung ganun lang din, papasok ako ng 8:30 then hindi ako magwowork ng 1 hr sa lunch break ko then 5:30 mag out na ako.

I have asthma and I work in a hospital, although I‚Äôm not a medical practitioner.

I went to work this Tuesday for the first time and got sick again ‚Äî colds, cough, asthma, fever, allergies.

Bg
- I have asthma 
- I‚Äôm underpaid, pay is just enough to buy food and leisure (clothes/food) but not enough to pay for rent or a car 
- I don‚Äôt pay rent / groceries - I‚Äôm reliant to my parent  
- Medical field is not my field, I chose it bc I was in a tight spot months ago and needed the money 
- I have savings that could last a couple of months 
Pros of staying 
- people are nice, I made some friends 
- Boss is nice (but won‚Äôt let us work from home lol)
- will have 1 year of experience 
Cons of staying

His name is Alfonso James Lacson. He claims to have a lot of SUCCESSFUL businesses under his belt. Namely D'Lacs, GIB (Gourmet in a Box). He will alsi claim to have established Palpitate. He will claim that he has a farm (does not specify what type, nor does respond properly to inquiry), he will also claim to have a resort and many more. Basically he claims to have a lot and accomplished a lot, which are all very questionable since it either does not exist or he cannot give proof. 

His modus: he likes hiring students that are looking for work. He specifically targets those who are deperate with work. He will promise lots of things like incentives, but fails to pay out their salary.

How do i know: i work with him at GIB, he was always delayed with giving out salaries, the delay gets longer and longer over time to the point where he owes his employees a whole month's worth. He still hasn't fully paid my salary until now. That's 3 months worth of salary from a year ago.

Why this guy sucks beyond what was already mentioned. He loves posting online, he constantly looks for ""investors"" for his business. He will basically offer ""investors"" a ln 8% cut of the monthly profit but the payout is locked every 6 months or more, the contract is good for 3 years. What ge doesn't tell the ""investors"" is how the profit is calculated. He tell the ""investors"" there are only 10 slots, which translates to the investors getting 80% of the total PROFIT all together, but in reality, he grabs additional investors behind the backs of the original 10 and promises the same 8%. He keeps doing this to keep getting more money to pay out his first batch of ""investors"" basically a ponzi scheme.

How does this guy earn money if he gives all the profit away? The resturant gets its stock from him. The resturant buys the stocks from him.

He also like to throw around shit like ""lawyer up"" when his young and inexperienced staff asks about their salary, ir when his ""investors"" even inquire about the business. He plays the victim every step of the way while getting the sales (yes, raw sales) from the store to buy his personal shit like a bottle of red wine which he will consume in the same store where he got the money from, in front of the staff he doesn't pay salaries to, because of his reason ""the store doesn't have enough sales""

Dear All OICs, AOICs, ________________ and staff, 

Starting January 2024, the following changes in OT and commission will take place. Please read carefully and understand. If you have any questions, please feel free to send me message. I will answer all questions, so we can make this new policy as clear as possible to everybody. 

*OVERTIME* 

As per general policy, we will discourage unnecessary overtime (OT) to reduce our operations expense. However, for certain situations, OT will be allowed subject to approval by ME or by your area managers or regional manager. 

ALL OTs should be pre-approved before the actual schedule. Please send me the OT form together with written explanation why OT is necessary for that particular situation (example : 3 day sale, extended mall hours, shortage of staff due to leave). 

For OT approval AFTER the schedule, please send me the OT form together with written explanation for the OT and corresponding proof indicating the need to do OT (example, sales report with time stamp signifying the time for the transaction). 

All unauthorized OTs (without approval) will not be paid by accounting.

Just to be VERY CLEAR: OT is stilled allowed, but OIC needs to justify the OT of every staff. UNAUTHORIZED OT will not be paid. 

*COMMISSION:* Take note, this change will affect SALES STAFF ONLY. 

Sales STAFF should have a minimum sales transactions and/or amount for them to receive their commission. If the staff fails to reach the minimum allowed sales transaction or amount, the sales staff will not receive their commission for the month. Only the add-ons will be released. 

By definition, TRANSACTION means complete prescriptions or frame only. All contact lens, CL solutions and accesories sales are not included in this total transaction. 

The following will be the minimum: 

Full Time Sales Staff:
15 transactions a day or 390 transactions per month OR 
‚Ç±300,000 sales¬† a month 

Sales/Asst Cashier or Sales/Asst Technician: 
10 transactions a day or 260 transactions per month OR
‚Ç±200,000 sales a month 

Sales Staff who continually do not reach their required number of sales transactions or amount for 2 consecutive months will be given a warning.
2 consecutive months - verbal warning 
4 consecutive months - written warning 
6 consecutive months - suspension 3 days
8 consecutive months - suspension 7 days
10 consecutive months - suspension 15 days
12 consecutive months - termination 

All probationary sales who will not reach the minimum target for 5 months will not be regularized. (3rd month evaluation is needed) 

We will have a revised quota form for next year to include the number of transactions for each sales staff. Please make sure the numbers in the quota form are correct and accurate. We will check the figures in the forms vs the encoder report. All incorrect numbers in the form will be considered as falsified and corresponding disciplinary action will be given to whoever is responsible. 

Effectivity of sanctions will take effect starting March 2024 commission. We can start implementing these in our stores as early as January 2024. No penalties, sanctions and forfeiture of commission yet for January and February 2024. 

For OT, start by reducing unneccesary OTs of the staff. No need to send for approval yet. 

For the sales commission, inform the sales staff of the change so they will be ready when this is implemented by March 2024. 

Everything written above is subject to change and will be finalized during OIC meeting in February.

Thank you for your cooperation. Again, for inquiries and clarifications, pls viber me.
Reminder about the memo regarding OT and sales staff:

Please discuss these with your staff properly during a proper meeting, and not just share in your group chat. Let them know that it will be implemented after the OIC meeting. If they have questions about the memo, please take note so we can have a discussion during the OIC meeting.

If there are negative reactions from staff, PLEASE make sure that you reply to them POSITIVELY.",15,12,0.86,Company alert üö©,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/18vqy1k/shoutout_sa_labor_violator_na_company_na_ito/,18vqy1k

So ayun. I rejected the offer kasi. Ibang iba talaga naranasan ko kumpara sa ibanginterview na na take ko. Pag ka introduce ko palang sa sarili ko,  ki-nut off na agad ako ng isa sa tatlong interviewer, na bakit daw ako nanginginig. Dahil nga ba daw ay sa interview? Personally daw ayaw nya sa ganun kasi sa tingin nya maraming mga hindi totoong salita binibitawan ang candidate para lang ma hire. Which is sa point ko naman is nagets ko siya. Pero hindi ba to valid na kina kabahan lang ako, at final interview ko na ito. Normal lang na paghandaan ko ang mga possible na tanong para sa ganitong sitwason. 

Sinabihan pa ako na may problema daw ako psychologically, or nang rereverse psychology ba daw ako sa mga taong makakaharap ko para makuha gusto ko. Dagdag pa Na may galit ba daw ako sa sitwasyon ko na mahirap lang ako. At yung passion ko daw hindi totoo kasi ang hinahangad ko lang ay pera hindi trabaho. Basta ang dami niyang sinasabi na isa daw akong arrogante, feeling superior daw ako. Doble kara, sinama nya pa pamilya ko na galit ba daw ako sa kanila dahil sa sitwasyon namin ngayon na mahirap.

Until some point na tumahan na siya kaka duda sakin. Di na kasi ako nag defend sa sarili ko sa mga pang huhusga nyang tanong aakin. i coconsider parin daa nila ako at ihire daw nila ako. tas ayon tinanong previous salary ko. Sinabi ko 12,000. Sumbat naman ng manager papayag ba daw ako na yun din starting ko. Sabi ko hindi, at nag reason out ako na sa huling trabaho ko, Nahihirapan ako i manage yung income na yun. Sabay sabi nila, kahit daw magkano salary ko. Kung di daw ako madisiplina sa pera, kahit magkano daw ay hindi talaga isasapat. Grabe, ang daming judge na nangyari sakin sa interview na yun. Tinaasan hanggang 15,000. Final na daw, sabi ko hindi nalang muna. Inisip ko kasi, napakadsming panghuhusga na nangyari sakin during that time at dagdag pa na sinama pamilya ko. naisip ko din na hindi ko nga kinaya mentally pang huhusga sakin, how much more if employed na ako sa kanila?

My supervisor in A is the epitome of a ""nepotism baby"" and we clash horribly. The President sees him as his ""son"" and grants him undeserved favor, despite his childish and disrespectful behavior. We clash at every turn, and honestly, I've considered leaving multiple times. This drove me to depression mid-year, but I focused on doing good work for A, B, and C.  
However, the President noticed my talent, didn't want to give me up, and gave me this promotion with the additional responsibility of two more startup companies. (These are startup companies from a known conglomerate in PH) There are other shared-service people in the office, but I handle everything marketing-related, from conceptualization to execution, without any dedicated support. 

Despite surviving Company A with a very difficult manager for over a year, I also focused on excelling with the other companies. But now, the pressure is on again. They're adding another company, Company D, next year, diluting my focus even further. From 33% per company, I'm expected to manage with just 25% of my time with a raise that will reach 6 digits. Yet, no additional staff! That's so absurd, and they are stretching me like a rubber band, even if they are rewarding good work with more work.

I love my work colleagues and juniors in A, B, and C. They respect me, and I was given peer recognition during our last year-end party. Some managers likes me too. But the disrespectful nepo baby, the President's favoritism and the insane workload that awaits me next year are crushing me.

Do I stick it out for the sake of ""good work"" or prioritize my sanity by resigning? It's hard to leave my colleagues, and I have only stayed in the company for more than a year. I don't know how long my emergency fund will last or how soon I can find a new job. I don't know if I'm wasting my potential here or if I am throwing everything away just because of my nepotistic former supervisor, whom I don't get along with.

We all know it's so d@mn impossible to learn everything, especially with payroll and compensation & Benefits in 4 days. 

Now, the reason why I'm thinking what if our manager suddenly inform me next week about not having to go to office and work anymore because ""the newly hired already knows how to do it""......  is because this specific manager fckng hates me to the core. He hates me because I complained to the head office all the mismanagement, him looking down to other employees, yelling at us, and telling us to fire someone just because they answered back to his message since apparently he said ""A manager shouldn't be talking to the low class employee who has no power"".. 

So, I know he's been looking forward to kick me out in the office because he can't stand that I look at him in the eyes quietly whenever he's yelling at me because I know I didn't do anything wrong, he hates that ""I look proud of myself"" when he's yelling at me.

The HR suggested that I may render until December 26 since they told me that they don‚Äôt want me to go to work if i‚Äôm not comfortable with my working environment since I have issues with my manager. The HR also told me that I don‚Äôt have to finish my pending work since they are in charge of the manpower and they can hire a reliever for it so they just asked me to finish what I can finish, I have
also endorsed my work to my colleagues via email. The HR supervisor spoke with my manager already and said that my manager is fine with it. I wrote a letter via mail informing them of my decision to have an immediate resignation. The HR already approved my immediate resignation via email. On December 27- after my last day, my manager emailed me saying that she is not approving my immediate resignation and said that I didn‚Äôt finish all my pending work. I don‚Äôt know what to follow anymore. My manager will not be signing my clearance and said that I am AWOL.

I do not have any background in writing. I was not graduated of any writing courses like journalism or creative writing.

To those already employed, how was it?
