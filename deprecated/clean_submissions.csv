1428,Pakikisama: A toxic Filipino work culture,"The title says it all.

Ayaw ko dito sa Pilipinas may toxic work culture tayo na ""pakikisama"" para raw tumagal sa company. And by pakikisama, it means plastikan sa office, sumama sa mga pizza parties, palibre during birthdays, kailangan mag-ambag para bigyan yon officemate mong toxic ng birthday cake, sumama sa team building kasi ""requirement"" kundi KJ ka raw.

Kaya gusto ko mag-remote kasi WORK is WORK lang. Hindi ko ugali makisama sa mga tao sa trabaho. I can be professional pero hindi ako yon tipong kailangan maki-buddy buddy o sumama sa office politics. Yon social battery ko rin sa trabaho maliit lang.

1270,You know what doesn't pay the bills? Promotions. You know what does? Job hopping.,"To be clear, this is *not* applicable to all industries/ companies. 


I'm in finance but I also have friends in HR, IT, and Admin who have experienced the same thing I have.


**Promotions used to mean something.** It was recognition of your hard work and a sign that the company values you. Does that mean your promotion increase will reflect how much they value you? No lol.


Your boss tells you you're great. You're so amazing. You're so intelligent and you produce great output. You have excellent project management and leadership skills. They have high hopes daw for your future in the company. And so, *you deserve this promotion*.


The promotion? Sobrang liit na percentage ng sahod mo. 5% is average. 13% is already a miracle for them.


Congrats! Ah but don't forget, with this promotion— comes more responsibilities, pressures, deadline, overtime, tasks, projects, expectations, and stress.


What a joke ma promote ngayon. Walang kwenta. Dagdag lang stress and hindi worth it. Akala mo naman sobrang laki ng binibigay nila sayo, as if kayo pa yung magiging *grateful* na binigyan ka ng promotion when you've actually *earned it* in the first place.


To clarify, I've also negotiated on these promotions several times pero typical excuse lang naman lagi na ""ceiling na yan"" or ""aligned with your market value yan"" which is all bullshit kasi isang job hop lang, sobrang taas na agad increase sa sahod mo.


So remember, wala nang kwenta ang promotion these days. It'll feel good for 10 minutes until you realize, not only can you still barely pay your bills but you have more stress now too. As far as I'm concerned, promotions are just a piece of paper these days.

• SM = May pangalan pero shitty management. I had a friend working there and puro office politics. Boomer management. Mga bullies.

• VIVO = I got an offer but I rejected. Why? Bunch of racist scums. Also, madalas yon OT I heard. 

• TaskUs = Shitty recruiting system. Check their reviews on Facebook

• Huawei = No OT pay. Heavy workload.

• Alorica = Ang baba ng sahod. 14k for fresh grad. You are better off with other companies.

• SPI Global = There is a contract bond worth 200k and you have ro work for them for 2 years.

• Waltermart = A former employee told me walang work-life balance doon if you worked for there back office

• Ricoh = Pinagyayabang na maganda printing services nila pero HR is unprofessional and rude. 

• Seven Seven = Agency ito. Bullshit itong company. May contract bonding and dinadaan sa ""nice words""

If it's listed on their job post, tell them that. You can negotiate once you have the J.O. (assuming you have the leverage). But let me tell you a funny story, I renogoniated once. Turns out wala naman pala akong offer! So from initial offer na 27K, I told them na meron nagoffer na 35K which is di naman pala sigurado. But they gave a raise. 32K.

If it's not listed then Ask for their budget. Pag kinulit ka sa salary mo, tell them you have NDA. They will stop asking and eventually give their budget.

Never ever tell them your price. Unless siguro pag malaki na yung usapan, don't waste each other's time.

But the idea is don't give them idea of what's your worth kase dun sila mag start. What if you're worth more than that pala?

1679,"I wanna hear your ""walk out"" stories","Nag walk out ka ba sa interview? Sa job? Sa boss mo? Sa office? Share natin kasi small win natin to.


Me first!

**Story 1**

Nag apply ako sa isang startup sa PH but the CEO was a foreigner. 

Day 1 - Interview with CEO agad (kasi startup nga) was scheduled at 2pm. I was there at 1:40pm. 2pm, wala pa. Sige, baka late lang. Then, sabi sa akin ni HR na delay lang daw si CEO and can I wait some more? Sabi ko, sure. Ito nangyari until 4pm then HR told me resched na lang and she was super apologetic about it.


In hindisight, red flag na nga but I really thought their company was impressive and baka nga may unavoidable emergency si CEO.


Day 2 - Arrived at 1:40pm again. CEO didn't arrive until 2:30pm and then proceeded to HANG OUT in his office. His office was a glass wall so I saw him typing some stuff on his laptop and even talked to a few people. I was sitting directly outside his glass office so kitang kita ako and he knew I've been waiting. Naalala ko naka stretch pa paa niya na relaxed. 3:30pm, I fucking walked out sa harap niya. It was so disrespectful and a waste of my time.


Hinabol ako ng HR but I said sorry, not interested anymore and this was very unprofessional. They tried to resched me for a 3rd interview but fuck that. I think intentional power trip move yun ng CEO for some reason.


**Story 2**


Another time is rendering na ako sa trabaho and yung boss ko pinipilit ako mag unpaid overtime para tapsuin yung report na hindi naman urgent. Pinipilit niya talaga sa mukha ko na bawal pa ako umuwi. Nag isip ako for a few seconds tapos sabi ko, ""No. Ayoko na."" then nag bye na ako sa lahat at kumaway tas umalis agad. Natakot ako at that moment but I don't regret it and it felt good.

991,Working at fastfood.,"I was working at fastfood for almost 2 years from 2019-2021. Hindi maganda ang work culture dun. Toxic masyado, ang managers sobrang bossy, may mga OT ako na hindi bayad. And may mga NASTY secrets akong alam when it comes food preparations. I wont drop the name of the company but i will drop some hints kung anong company 'to 🤡. 

1. May cockroaches sa countertops namin, like gumagapang ang mga cockroaches while we are preparing the food. 

2. Food utensils, please take note on this. If you are planing to eat at fast food resto wag kayong gagamit ng metal utensils. Ask for plastic ones or bring your own utensils na lang. Sinasawsaw lang namin sa dish soap ang mga metal utensils. Imagine covid is still around then the utensils you are using in fastfood restos are not properly cleaned and disinfected. Di ko sinisiraan ang company this is true.

3. You know the oil that the fishball vendor and kwekkwek vendor came from sa fastfood every week our managers are selling used oils to this vendors. Madumi yun everytime ako ang assigned to grill patties you will see burnt debris ng patties sa oil and then sasama yun sa used oil na binibenta ng managers. Kadiri putangina.

Ang panget ng database nila, ang daming mali and ang daming kulang. The director told me to help fix it since the operations team who was handling it was overwhelmed. Same department kami and bago lang ako noon kaya I said, sige tulungan ko na (big mistake, dapat nag tanga tangahan nalang ako)

I fixed it on my 6th month (on top of my own KPIs). I endorsed everything to the Operations Manager, informed him how to organize his work to avoid this problem in the future. Fyi, specialist lang ako tapos manager siya ha. Fast forward to today, tinawagan ako ng supervisor from another department and told me a problem related to this and I told him its not with me anymore and to contact the ops manager. Sabi nung supervisor ginawa nya na daw yun pero walang ginawa to resolve the issue. And that there’s a lot of problem ulit sa system. Sabi ko lang, follow up nya nalang ulit. 

Operations manager sent me an email regarding the concern and I replied this should be fixed by him or his team. He came to me and shouted why I replied that and said that its my job. I told him no, I was only helping you out and I endorsed everything already. Its not my job. I don’t report to him. 

He said don’t speak with the supervisor regarding this. Galit na galit siya. Kahit na hindi naman ako yung nagapproach. Yung mga supervisor naman ang lumalapit sakin kasi ang bagal ng ops kumilos at ang hirap nila kausap. I just said the truth na hindi ko naman talaga trabaho yun.

Ako ba ang mali dito? Feeling nya trabaho ko talaga yun? Iba talaga ang kakapalan ng mukha. Nakakainis. Nagsisisi ako kasi tinulungan ko pa sila.

1124,Hustle culture is a lie to avoid paying us a livable wage,"I work in finance and I make average. Mahigpit pa rin ang bills. Never pa rin ako makakabili ng bahay or kotse. May savings din pero nababawasan sometimes per month kasi hindi talaga maiiwasan yung unexpected expenses. I doubt makakaretire ako ng maayos. Hindi lang naman ako nabubuhay para sa sarili ko. Gusto ko din mag provide sa guardians ko pero kahit ""maganda"" trabaho ko, kulang pa rin para bayaran bills nila.


Sinabi ko sa coworker ko na gusto ko mag hanap ng ibang trabaho na mas malaki sahod. Sabi niya, bakit hindi na lang ako mag remote work na VA? Hustle lang daw ako. Or magbenta ng mga gamit online. Pwede daw ako mag work sa office during the day tas nightshift sa gabi na VA remote. Napatitig na lang ako sa kanya kasi puro r/antiworkPH yung nasa isip ko.


Oo, may hustle culture. Some people work 2- 4 jobs. Yung iba, may fulltime job sa umaga, under the table na trabaho sa gabi, tas minsan may side hustle and freelance pa. Sobrang hanga ako sa mga tao na kaya to. Alam ko din naman minsan ito lang din paraan mara makapera talaga. But this should **not** be normal.


Dapat nabubuhay tayo sa isang trabaho lang. Yun yung original meaning ng minimum wage in the first place. If may skills ka, whether educated or not, you deserve to be paid a livable wage.


Multinational company naman yung employer ko and may billions in profit so sobrang fucked up na yung mga emplayado nila kailangan pa ng 2nd job para makahinga lang. 


Hustle cultute is necessary these days but should not be. We should be paid a livable wage to live our lives. We shouldn't have to *earn* our basic rights from capitalist lords. It's fucked up.


Sinasabi nila maganda yung hustle culture as if it's something to aspire to. It's not. Sinasabi lang nila yan kasi the more we work, the more profits for the capitalists. They like seeing us work 24/7 because it only benefits them. Meanwhile tayo, masasacrifice yung physical health, mental health, hobbies, personal time, family time, relaxation, energy, and more.

Yung iba link directly to the job ad, yung iba may posts na directa so you can read it directly sa reddit. Yung ibang sources kase I can control the duplicates. Yung iba I can't and I had to rely on Reddit's feature na ifilter yung duplicate links.

Of course, it's nothing personal. That's their policy. Nakakababa lang.

Ganyan kadalasan yung hirap ng mga nagwowork inside those warehouse. Yung co-worker ko nga dati nasabihan na ""hindi namin kayo binabayaran para maupo"". All day, nakatayo kayo at nagsosort, nagpapack, nagwra-wrap  at nag hihila sa truck ng mga items.

Ang matindi pa niyan yung employment mo under ka ng agency. So hindi ka nagwowork sa kanila. Yung contract mo seasonal lang. Minsan two weeks lang. Tapos ire-renew ka lang ng ire-renew. And for sure, pag tapos ka na iho-hold pa ng matindi yung sweldo mo.

1483,300/day (12 hrs shift),"First time ko mag post sa sub na ito. 

Yes, tama yung nabasa nyo na 300/day. I am a registered nurse graduated in 2010. Way back napaka hirap maghanap ng ospital na mapapasukan, kadalasan ay ""volunteer"" ang io-ffer sayo at ikaw pa ang magbabayad sakanila. (wala ka pa ngang sahod, ikaw pa ang magbabayad sakanila. edi wow) 

Sa paghahanap ko ng mga ospital halos nalibot ko na yung kahabaan ng East Ave. para mag apply pero wala ako pambayad sakanila. Napunta ako sa isang private hospital sa Marikina City. Doon i started as a volunteer nurse without pay. 8 hours duty na walang bayad, sobrang toxic ng trabaho, maraming pasyente, literal na pawisan pa ako sa Emergency Room doon dahil walang AC. Pinag tyagaan ko na lang to gain some ""experience"" at masasabi ko na natuto talaga ako. Gumaling ang clinical skills ko, ang medical judgement, medical decision. (pero nakakasama ng loob kasi I am serving the hospital for free) 

Then after 6 months na pag duty ng walang bayad, they finally considered me as a regular reliever. (di ko pa alam that time kung meron ba talagang ganong position) Natuwa naman ako kasi finally magkakasahod na ako, but they told me na 300/day ang sahod ko (12 hrs shift). Kinagat ko na rin syempre nag tyaga nga ako ng 6 months na walang sahod e diba? haha. Tapos non tumagal yata ako sa hospital na yun for  year and a half tapos nag resign na rin ako.

So sad the reality ng mga kapwa ko nurses dito sa Pinas. Sa totoo lang masarap mag silbi sa kapwa pilipino, masarap tumulong sa kapwa pero siyempre lahat tayo may pangangailangan sa buhay na hindi sapat naibibigay ng ating Gobyerno.

1015,Are outsourced recruiters the worst kind of recruiters?,"Just sharing my bad experience with an outsourced recruiter for AboitizPower. I applied via Kalibrr and an outsourced recruiter reached out (I know na outsourced siya because I checked his LinkedIn profile haha). He scheduled an initial interview on a Friday at 1:30pm. 30 mins before the interview, he cancelled because he had an ""emergency"" daw so he asked if we could move the interview to next Monday. I asked what time specifically, he did not respond so I assumed it was the same time as before. 

The following Monday, I followed-up once again, still no response. Akala ko wala na 'to then two days later, the recruiter messaged me and apologized for not responding immediately (no explanation why) and then re-scheduled the interview to next Tuesday. I agreed (even though I shouldn't have due to the red flags) then when I asked what time specifically, guess what, he did not respond again! I waited until the following Tuesday and still no invite from him. By that time I was pissed so I immediately blocked his number. Hindi naman ako nanghinayang since I wasn't excited about both the role and the company in the first place (I was just sending out my applications everywhere haha). But the fact that I blocked my calendar to make room for this interview only to be ghosted was really disappointing. I guess this kind of practice is common to outsourced recruiters, yung bigla ka na lang ighoghost on your interview? This wasn't the first, I've had outsourced recruiters before who promised to get back to me for an interview but didn't.

1615,Toxic Manager,"Pa-rant lang ako kasi matagal ko na talaga ito dinadamdam. I work as a Senior Designer for a BPO company and my client is an IT Solutions company that based in Australia. 

My client loves my work, my work ethics, and me. They see me as an asset of the company as I an the first full time designer that they had. Lahat ng hingin ko, binibigay pero siyempre hinihingi ko for work naman. Example, I asked for a M1 Macbook Pro because before may power outage sa amin almost everyday. Ayun, binigay naman sa akin. Then my boss would send me surprise hamper baskets (mga groceries ganyan). Pero the hamper needs to go through the BPO company because sila yung bibili for me.

One time, my client told me that she was going to send me some goodies. So dinaan sa BOO company and then my manager wanted to have a quick chat about it. So nag usap kami and then to my surprise, ito yung sinabi niya: “Grabe no? Binibigay sayo lahat ng hinihingi mo. Kahit hindi ka naman magaling” I WAS SHOOKT TO THE CORE MATE. 

I told this to my boss (client) and she was furious and gusto niya isumbong sa CEO. But sabi ko huwag na because I have no solid proof because via google meet kami nag usap. Nakakalungkot lang. Sometimes I think out of inggit kung bakit niya nasabi yon sa akin because yung other staff niya that also works dun sa client ko, walang natatanggap na ganung treatment. But still, he should be happy kasi the client is happy. But I guess not.

999,"The only way to stop ""Contract Bonds"" is by not signing it","Unfortunately, this is not illegal based on our labor law. It may be unethical but if you tru to report this to DOLE, most likely you will not have any feedback since you have signed the contract agreeing you will pay an amount of money.

With the excemption of few why contract bonds are valid, there are employers there using this crap as an excuse to threat and fool applicants. So I always advise job-seekers to always read the fine print before signing. 

Worst case scenario if you did end up in a situation like this, the best you can do is to compromise with employer and HR how will you go about this. My friend had the same dilemna and in the end, they just didn't give her final pay and 13th month instead of asking her to pay 200k. 

With that said, in avoidance of these stupid bonds and denormalizing it, the best way to do so is by not working with such company that has this stupid agreement. Never ever agree a contract bond unless there is a good training being offered in abroad. But other than that, if they have this bonding fee and you are just working in PH as a regular employee, just don't sign it. It will save you a lot of time, money, and energy. 

If all job seekers are aware of this, this will give much more chances for contract bonding to be illegal and not practiced especially to manipulative employers. Unfortunately, there are still some who agrees to work at a company with bonding fee hence it is still being practiced today",62,26,0.98,True,Tips 🔔,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/w6u3d3/the_only_way_to_stop_contract_bonds_is_by_not/,2022-07-24 20:04:25,w6u3d3

For example, nagkukunwari ako na nahihiya ako mag present sa mga VIP clients ng important pitch. This way, e dadahan dahan lang ako ni management tsaka bibigyan lang ako ng mga training on ""how to present"". Tapos at some point, makikita nila ang galing ko na mag present and sobrang confident ko. Proud din yung management sa ""growth"" ko and natuwa din sila sarili nila na gumana training nila. Pero sa totoo lang, never naman ako nahihiya or naiilang. Kayang kaya ko naman. Tamad lang, lalo na hindi ko naman main job yun. In the end, dahil sa galing ng ""growth"" and ""initiative to learn"" ko, na gustuhan nila ako. Na promote pa ako.


Also, nagkunwari ako na hindi ako ganun ka galing sa excel. Sabi ko I need time to study excel bago e improve yung current file nila. So mga ilang days, onti onti lang gingawa ko. Pa relax relax lang. Tapos naguupdate lang ako sa ""progress"" sa boss ko kahit alam ko naman talaga paano tapusin ng mabilisan. Sa huli, pinakita ko yung improved excel file and impressed ulit sila sa growth ko. Mukha akong self- starter and passionate employee lol.


Is this ethical? Eh. Who cares. Even with the promotions, 1k to 2k lang naman na increase. I still contributed to the company's success. I could have done it faster, yes but do I care? No lmao. I'm gonna do things in my own, relaxing pace and management can feel proud of themselves for ""investing"" in me. If they want to really appreciate me, e pakita nila sa payslip ko. Hindi lang puro compliments.

For example, if I made the same mistake, I might get a warning. But for the pretty person, they’d get let off the hook easily. They’d also get a warning albeit jokingly or lightly. 

One time, I even had a teammate open the door for my pretty co-worker, and although we were visibly entering together, they couldn’t even hold the door open for me too. 

Not asking for advice here. Just want to listen to your stories, whether you’re on the pretty privileged side or the one who noticed that someone in your office who’s attractive gets more benefits somehow.",80,47,0.96,True,Discussions 💭,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/wu2869/how_has_yoursomeone_elses_pretty_privilege/,2022-08-21 23:25:47,wu2869

Additional info: End of February 2022 sya na-hire so technically, meron syang 10 days VL applicable this year and the remaining 5 days, nagsabi na din sya na willing to be unpaid leave.

1255,Lessons from My First Job,"I am finally rendering the last week of my very first job. Hindi ako umabot ng 1 year and that alone speaks volume (tho 1 week nalang sana at mag o one year na ako sa company). I just feel like writing here to document my realizations of a young adult na early na burnout and to probably help some readers of this sub. And if I may add, sa AntiworkPh ko rin navalidate ang urge kong mag resign from very first job kaya maybe proper lang na i return the favor.

Disclaimer: All of the lessons enumerated are personal insights. You may or may not agree with these and that's fine. I believe this sub is a safe place for varied opinions.

**Lesson #1:  Don't feel pressured to work just because your peers are doing so**.  
If you are able,then please take the time to look for the right company. Na pressure kasi ako sa mga peers ko na nakahanap na agad ng work which led me to accepting a job offer even tho i havent properly researched or had a good background of the work culture. Mindset ko kasi that time basta lang may work okay na, atleast im doing what everyone's doing. My lack of preparation led me to a job that constantly gave me anxiety and burnout.

&#x200B;

**Lesson #2: Dont accept a job that comes with ""URGENTLY HIRING"" advertisement.**  
Tendency kasi is that may aalis sa current position na inaaplayan mo and usually very limited na ang time para ma turnover sayo ang responsibilities. And based sa experience, tatambakan ka talaga ng backlogs. If you wish to accept job posts like this, make sure to ask HR if there will be an adequate amount of time para ma turnover sayo ang responsibilities mo.

&#x200B;

**Lesson #3: During interview, always ask HR how is the company when it comes to work life balance, work culture, turnover rates, and the likes.**  
By doing this, you will be able to determine whether you are amenable with the company given this limited information. Key point is the turnover rates, if you can, ask for the turnover rate for the specific position you are applying. If mabilis, then that's definitely a red flag. Definitely ask the company regarding work life balance kasi dun mo ma memeasure if ang future mo  sa company will be working to live or living to work. Always choose the first. And even if HR sugarcoats their answer, malalaman mong they're lying based on how they answer.

&#x200B;

**Lesson #4: As much as possible, dont apply in companies na 6 days work week.**  
Ito siguro dahilan kung bakit early akong na burnout. For fresh grads out there, consider yung college days natin. If too much na nga ang 5 schooling days then how much more ang 6 working days? Some people can probably survive, pero very lesson learned na para sa akin to ensure na may atleast 2 DAYS REST DAY ako. Eh nung student pa ako kulang na kulang na nga sa akin ang weekends to rest.  Having a one day day off constantly makes me dread going to work.

&#x200B;

**Lesson #5: Observe how your seniors work.Pag nasa company ka na, observe the work culture of your seniors.**  
Kasi doon din naman ang path na pupuntahan mo if you prefer to stay longer sa company. From experience kasi, few months into my work, napapansin kong always nag OOT ang mga seniors ko and nagtatrabaho parin kahit nasa bahay. Wala talagang work life balance mga seniors ko kaya i decided to resign kasi im starting to experience it also.

  
**Lesson #6: Never apply sa family business ng mga FIL-CHINESE companies.**  
Bossing mo lahat ng family member at napakabarat when it comes to salary increase. Para sa kanila, bawal ang overbreak pero okay lang overworked.

&#x200B;

These are the lessons i wish i told my unemployed fresh grad self. Definitely, magagamit ko ito for the next employer pero for now magpapahinga muna ako. If you are reading up to this point, thank you for doing so at sana may natutunan ka..... Adiosssss, last 5 days of work here i comeeeeee :)",178,40,0.99,True,Discussions 💭,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/xnp9s8/lessons_from_my_first_job/,2022-09-25 22:45:41,xnp9s8
1779,Applying for a job at PH companies is such a pain,"Long story short, I was suddenly downgraded to fewer hours of work per month at my current wfh job so that means less moolah. Because I'm the eldest sacrificial lamb in the family, I had no choice but to look for another opportunity immediately. Fortunately, after 3 weeks of finding work, attending interviews, and a huge load of tests/assessments/whatnot - I finally landed a job that offered twice my current salary (before being downgraded to smaller hours).

It's a relief, yes, but oh my god the fucking hassle when I'm applying for PH companies. I understand the usual Initial Interview, and then the interview with the department head or CEO or another boss, and maybe an assessment of some sort - but some companies are taking it to the extreme, I've had interviews where I have to pass a short video introduction, an initial interview, an initial assessment, interview with a senior at that department, and then finally a panel interview. It took weeks for some job applications to proceed with the next step and others don't even bother to let you know that they already hired someone or they won't take you.

From my experience, applying to foreign clients / companies are even better since they only want your resume and portfolio, an interview with possibly a Filipino HR/Recruiter/Department Senior and then finally an interview with the boss and it's done. The longest application process I had with foreign companies only took 3 days.  Heck, the work that I have now only interviewed me once and gave me a job offer after 2 days!

But ayun, just want to vent out because I was losing my mind finding an immediate source of income and it pains me to go through such  a tedious application process only to be ghosted.",71,14,0.99,True,Rant 😡,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/xowm8w/applying_for_a_job_at_ph_companies_is_such_a_pain/,2022-09-27 05:33:28,xowm8w

1126,Bawal magkasakit mga bes. Immortal dapat tayo.,"Share ko lang yung pinaka kupal na interview na naranasan ko this week.

I was up for a final interview in a well known (I think) BPO company. During that time sobrang sinisipon ako dahil ata sa lamig ng panahon. Pero di naman ako nilalagnat talagang makulit lang yung sinus ko.

So si interviewer napansin nya ata na may sipon ako, he asked if I was sick. I told him no, I think it's due to the weather. Then I proceeded to apologize for sniffling too much.

Binanatan ba naman ako na in case you get hired, we expect you to have a healthy lifestyle to avoid absences due to flu or cold. Nagpantig tenga ko mga bes.

I told him, ""I'm sorry I can't guarantee you I will not get sick in the future. I don't think I can push through with this application since my values are not aligned with the company""

He tried to reason out na they are quite particular when it comes to attendance. I told him I understand that's how their account works but I don't think I'll agree with that environment.

Hindi ko alam kung hindi lang aware mga toh tunkol sa workers rights but it just proves na karamihan sa mga Filipino workers ay kulang sa knowledge regarding our labor law + they always settle for bare minimum. Magegets ko kung pandemic ang reason bakit laid off ang workers but if you guys were laid off because an employer chose to hire a celebrity over caring your well-being, bakit magiging grateful ka pa? Kung ako sa inyo, baka mabwiset pa ako especially if I am the breadwinner of my family.

And as much as I want to sympathize these people, ang hirap knowing their privilege asses are enabling a shitty working system + they don't care who were negatively affected on this.

1778,"Recruiter messed up with the rate, stood my ground coz why not?","I had a multi-step interview with a company in Japan and they're looking to hire a team of Filipino devs. I was initially approached by a recruiter (looks like it was an outsourced recruiter) and gave me a P260,000 - P300,000 figure (full remote). So being money-hungry that I am, I went to the interviews and passed them with flying colors. Last step was with the CEO and non-technical higher ups for ""culture fit"".

Then comes the salary negotiation. I told them that the recruiter told me ""at least P260,000"" and so I'm okay with that rate. Awkward silence....CEO said sorry because that's supposed to be the rate if they hire locally.

I've been with lots of interviews (I got to interviews even without the need or desire to change employment, just to check the job market) and I'm fairly certain that I'm one of their top picks (I was one of the top picks of their technical team) so I held my ground. They asked what's my wiggle room and said ""that P260,000 was supposed to be my wiggle room"", then just went silent. Lots of awkward silence and stuttering until they decided to end the interview to discuss how they'll proceed with this problem.

I'm a bit pissed at the recruiter though. I'm not sure if he really messed up or purposely gave a different rate to get more response. Eitherway, while the rate is an 100% increase, I ain't lowering it. If you're a dev with PHP stack, look for that job on LinkedIn.

Pero jusko in my current situation and in my current career track, EVERYTHING AND EVERYONE is on FB. I have to add our head coordinator, our instructors, and classmates/schoolmates on my personal account, and sandamakmak na GC sa Messenger. Sa GC and Facebook Groups kasi ang mga info for important stuff - OJT schedules, OJT/school requirements, announcements, and everything else in between.

Also noticed it on my friends who are in other fields too, such in Medicine (kasali mga Nursing and MedTech). However, they are smart enough to use Telegram/Viber. Pero sa amin, FB talaga.

A huge part of our academic and work culture is dependent on Facebook. While I don't mind it to some degree, there are certain things that get blurry. Some people do not know boundaries. Some are comfortable of airing laundry (clean and dirty) on public. 🥴

But I also utilized my FB to express dismay over some people in my current field who love giving me unsolicited comments about my weight gain. After writing such emotionally-charged post, those people decreased their unsolicited commenting.

Grabe, ang ganda talaga mag trabaho dito. I even feel sad sa mga co-workers ko na Japanese at US project ang dinadala.  


Moderate lang yung workload dito. Sila pa mismo magagalit kapag lumagpas ka ng 5pm. Parang once a week lang yung OT dito. Kung meron mang OT, 2 hours na yung pinaka matagal. Ang laid-back talaga ng mga Australian. Super chill sa buhay.  Nag stalk ako sa Instagram ng mga Australian counterpart namin. Halos every weekend pupunta sila sa bundok at mag camping doon, o di kaya sa ilog mag fifishing.  


Nung hindi pa ako regular dito, minsan nasasabi ko sa sarili ko, ""Wala naman akong matutunan dito"" at ""Meron kaming sahod, pero halos walang ginagawa. Kawawa naman yung company hahaha"".  
Tapos sinabihan ako ng manager namin, ""Ganun talaga ang mga Australian. Masasanay din kayo. Wag kayo mag overthink. Natural lang talaga ng kunti lang ang ticket natin araw araw'  


Australians value time and family. More work hours doesn't necessarily mean more production. Opposite talaga sila sa Japanese work culture. Leaders know how to lead, hindi kagaya dito sa Pinas, nagyayabang dahil mataas ang rank. Australian leaders know how to manage and teach that won't make you feel stupid.

1789,Rejected a client's request for screen monitoring,"Short intro. Got hired by a US client, full-time 40 hours per week. Pay is good and all and the client is a little bit old but super friendly during the interview. He only wants someone to work on his social media accounts while he does his business. So G naman and all.

Fast forward to 2 weeks later, he sent an email request to download a screenshot monitoring app on my laptop. I checked the app and it screenshots your entire workspace (all monitors), monitors your website surfing, and checks the activity rate of your keyboard and mouse. I ignored the email since we were going to have a meeting naman on that day so I planned on talking to him about this.

Client forgot all about it for another week and so did I. But as soon as na-bring up niya ito during our daily meetings, I asked if he can remove the function for screenshot and website monitoring. I told him I am comfortable with monitoring the work hours (basically logging every task and time) and the activity rate of my keyboard and mouse.

He asked why and I told him that since he's not providing a work laptop, I am using my personal laptop to do all my tasks. That means that while I'm working, there  are other windows that are open such as Viber, FB Messenger, Whatsapp, and my personal social media accounts. I mentioned that I'm not comfortable with an app that randomly screenshots my entire workspace since I value my privacy.

We never reached a decision. I never settled with downloading the app and he mentioned that it'll be his homework to study the app first so it will be better for the both of us.

So ano point ko? Wala. Lol just kidding. Let this be a lesson I guess that it's okay to reject some things at work without arguing or creating a scene. As you can see here, binigyan ko agad siya ng good enough reason bakit ayoko ng screenshot monitoring (pero siyempre of course baka makita niya while working naka open netflix ko lmao). He insisted but I never settled since I'm sure na magiging problem ko siya in the future kapag may super personal message akong mahagip sa screenshot.

1042,Ghosting why it happens and how to cope,"**Prelude**

Before anything else. Please gather some confidence to read this. I'll tell you, I can't help myself not filter what really happens in the background as the recruiter. BTW, this is a long-post. Thus the prelude.

\---

**Introduction**

I've been seeing a lot of posts about being ghosted by a recruiter. Be it they didn't call back after signing a job offer, no calls after the technical-or-initial interview, or worst, no call at all. Yes, I know it sucks to be treated that way. I personally been in your situation when starting my career and even during my early job hopping experience.

Guess what, I didn't dwell on it nor asked what company is it for me to avoid it. I applied and they were even the ones chasing me. Yes, the people/company you hated were the ones chasing me. So what's the difference between you and me? And please all of these are hypothetical, so if it hits you and you get triggered, sleep on it first so you'd comprehend.

\---

**Why does ghosting happen?**

When you apply, what happens is that a recruiter will read your CV. Then check on available job posts for a cross-match even if you did it yourself. They might reach out and call you, to get some details so it's up to you what you can disclose.

After that, it will go back to the pool waiting for a skills/technical interview. Yes, another skilled person will review your CV. And if they aren't interested, they'll park it until you're the last person in the batch. Being the last option hurts, but only proves my point so continue reading... 

Basically, your profile gets deprioritized and simply put rejected. I know and completely understand you'd want to hear the rejection from them. But if you received a failed response and your peers with identical skill sets as you knew, they won't apply there anymore.

\---

**So why is your profile getting deprioritized?**

There's only one reason why. There's someone better than you. Or better put, there's someone else who can do the job without much training needed. Despite the salary requirements.

Now you would tell me, I need a job and I can't build that experience without a job, so how can I compete? You upskill yourself. It's 2022 today and most skill literature is shared on Youtube, Tiktok, etc. So instead of mopping around you got rejected or coping with the rejection by playing games and being unproductive. BTW just gives more reason not to hire you. You need to discipline yourself to match the job. You're the one asking for the job right, so know what's needed to get the job.

\---

**My personal experience, as an applicant (when I started)**

*This is my personal experience when I started looking for a job. Nope, not the present when most jobs can't afford to hire me.*

I've applied to a hundred jobs or basically run a shotgun to what jobs are available with the keyword ""Java"". Of the 100, only 30 initially interviewed me, then only 20 proceed to a technical interview and only 10 made a job offer. As for the 70 postings who ghosted me, I didn't care to ask why. Oh, I did experience a dry spell wherein all 50 applications turned 0 interviews.

What's the reason for giving me the offer? It was simply I was the right man for the job. And ironically, I was one ghosting those 9 job offers. Why, for the same reason, I deprioritized them. All for a company that values my skills and career growth.

\---

**My personal experience as a recruiter** 

I've been a recruiter for 9 years. Been an IT programmer for 10 years before retiring. So handling 100+ CVs a day while meeting the target KPIs and only having 2 hours to scheme them all, just imagine how many CVs are left unread and ghosted. Look, am not proud of it even am sharing it. See the picture. And yes, when I got the chance to catch up, there are good applicants that I'd missed as they already have taken a job.

Add in my hourly limit as a recruiter for just 10 hours a week as I need to run 40 hours on the main job, it's hard to read all CVs and interview them (which BTW takes 1-2 hours for a skills interview). You get the picture.

\---

**My proposal to combat ghosting**

Since am I became a part-time recruiter and a programmer. I programmed an application tracking system or HRIS for that agency. Yes, we still encode the data and all, but all recruiters were able to keep a track of all applicants and what's their status. We even sent an email notification only for rejection. But the best part, we get scolded by the hiring manager because he gets notified that this applicant has been left in the ""For initial interview"" after 3 days.

Did that help? In my perspective, yes! Then again, not all recruitment agency has the same budget for one nor have a centralized way to store/update applicant status.

\---

**How should you cope?**

The answer is simple. You submit your application, but don't expect a reply. Treat your application as done and rejected. I know that's kinda doing reverse psychology to yourself. But it helps change your mindset from chasing the company to letting the company chase you. And the same applies to every step of your application.

And what if there's no one interviewing you? Then you need to upskill. I've said it before, your current skills aren't a match, or better yet, there's someone better than you and more qualified. So start investing in your skills.

\---

**How to deal with recruiters/companies who are known to a ghosts?**

Actually, nothing. Just hit apply like you didn't apply. And if they called you, good, but don't expect any. Again this is the let them chase you mindset and not you chasing the company. 

\---

**Why need to change your mindset?**

It's simple, to value your worth. And am going to touch a bit about low-balling.

Most applicants who get a verbal offer intuitively accept the offer before reviewing it. And when they post here to review, they get dumbfounded that it's a low salary for that position. And it pains to see their excited faces turn to frustration. That's you chasing the company mindset.

Now if you start the let the company chase you, and they gave you an offer below your accepting rate, you can decline. You'd be surprised that there will be offers that will give-in to your asking salary consdiering you really are worth the rate.

1686,"""May sakit din ako pero pumapasok ako""","Throwaway account. 

For context, nababawas kasi ang sick leave sa productivity stats namin eh 30% ng monthly scorecard namin is under productivity kaya ganun ka-big deal sa project namin kung magfifile kami ng sick leave kahit na may right naman kaming gamitin ang SLs namin. 

Ngayon, may ka-team akong nag-sick leave tas pinaalam naman niya sa TL namin. Tapos itong TL namin, imbes na mag-worry sa kalagayan ng teammate ko, guilt trip kaagad una niyang ginawa. Sabi kaagad ""kahit naman ako may sakit ako ngayon pero pumapasok ako"" mga ganito ganyan. Itong ka-team ko napilitan tuloy mag file ng full shift OT sa rest day niya para lang mabawi niya yung lost hours niya.

Laging ganyan TL namin actually kung may nagkakasakit sa amin. After namin magpaalam, magdradrama TL namin sa gc namin at ililista niya lahat ng pinagdadaanan niya pero nagwowork pa rin siya. Akala siguro niya ma-iinspire kami sa mga pinagsasabi niya pero mas namumulat kami kung gaano kami ka-overworked (10hrs + sapilitang OT) at natotoxican sa project na to.

Wala naman talaga magagawa TL ko at management kung gusto namin mag-sick leave pero tangina lang talaga kung sino nag-isip ibawas sa productivity ang sick leave kahit priveleged kaming gamitin.

1077,We are cheap labor. Don't sacrifice your health or free time for a small fraction of your Western counterpart's salary,"Tiningnan ko ang job posts para sa trabaho ko sa US at Canada. Hindi man lang umabot sa kalahati ng sahod nila ang sahod ng mga Pinoy kahit na same or even better skills at more experience ang meron dito. 

Sasabihin nila mas mababa ang sahod ng Pinoy kasi lower cost of living dito. Pero ang profits ng foreign employers siyempre dolyar.

Kaya heto relaxed lang ang work pace ko. Sakto lang to meet deadlines. 

Sana walang pabibo na bibilisan ang gawa at baka mapataas ang expectations sa amin. Cheap labor na nga kami, kung tataasan pa niya ang productivity we'll get even cheaper.

Enjoy the weekend, refuse OT, don't hesitate to use VL or SL para magpatingin sa doktor or dahil wala lang ayaw mo lang magtrabaho on that day.


Edit: Para sa mga nagsasabi na kung hindi ka bibo, you won't succeed o kaya matatanggal ka sa trabaho

Paano ang US employees na kasama sa mass layoff dahil in-outsource ang trabaho nila, ibig sabihin they didn't work hard? Paano ang retail workers at HCWs na nagtrabaho sa kalagitnaan ng pandemic at couriers na nagdedeliver sa gitna ng bagyo pero maliit ang sahod, they don't work hard?

Ang mga Pakistani puro fault finders, blamers tsaka parang may personal grudge pag kinorect mo. Tapos ang tatamad! Ayaw mag interview ng applicant na mahaba ang resume kasi matagal daw, tapos imagine final interview 20 minutes lang! 

Tapos ang babastos pa. Sasabihan kami ""where are the applicants? Where are the applicants?"" Eh inexplain sakanila naturally may lul talaga sa applicants pag ber-months kasi walang gusto mag resign sa job nila now for the 13th month pay.

Pina sign niyo pala di pa sure ang contract with client?

Ngl company culture here at my new job seems much better than other places I've worked (though 3 months pa lang ako dito), but I just can't bring myself to be as motivated or as cheerful as my north american counterparts. They're all smiles and they're always sooo eager to work and i feel na it's genuine talaga. I guess it's easy to feel that way when things are relatively easy?

1001,Being fresh grad with no experience and being desperate to land on a job truly the worst combination,"I'm currently working at my first job. It's been weeks since.  I graduated late so, I'm in my mid twenties.  Hence, I'm very desperate to get a job since a lot of companies are picky with age.  

The company that I am right now is a Fil-Chi company, yeah. The orientation was fast and seemed nice. HR explained to me the guidelines and the vision/mission.. yadah yadah of the company. Anyway, it's 6-day work a week including weekends, yes, we have work on Saturdays and Sundays.  Which I found weird because during the interview I was told the work days are from Monday - Saturdays only. Our work starts at 6:15 am which caught me off guard,, then during my first day, I thought there's just a lot of things to do, hence my co-workers went home later than I am. Though I went home around 5:30pm already. lol. On my second day, I was thinking it's probably okay for me to leave right off at 4pm, but no, I couldn't do that in fact I went home at 7pm. lol. Everyone in the office ay laging nag-out ng 6pm and that's the earliest already. And I'm obligated to do the same. It's insane too cause we also have work on holidays which the HR never mentioned to me during contract signing nor orientation. Nakakatawa kasi kahit 4pm dapat out mo need mo pa magpaalam na mag-out ka on time or kapag mag out ka before 6pm. Then after talking to one of the employees here, I also found out we're not entitled for sick leave. If we inform the company that we won't be able to go to work due to fever, that's automatically counted as absent. Currently, I have a high fever. And guess what? Nobody cares. I'm still obligated to carry heavy things, do many tasks, and work normally. It's also not helping how my co-workers are bunch of workaholics. They don't have problem going home late since their houses are only 15mins ride away from the office, meanwhile I'm 1 and half hour ride away from our house.

As a newbie in the field, and still trying to understand the whole tasks, our boss already expected me to know the whole cycle, system, and terminologies here. My co-workers who seemed nice, suddenly feel so distant. They're gatekeeping the tasks from me. The former employee na papalitan ko sa position only trained me for like a week, and the manager told us na itong certain area lang ituro nya sakin which is ayun nga lang natutunan ko. Now, wala na yung nagtrained sakin, I have to do everything without guidance, kapag gagawin ko na yung tasks na di naman tinuro sakin (pero part trabaho ng pinalitan ko) lagi kong naririnig ""ako na bahala."" Or ""akin na ako na."" I wanted to learn too. Nakakabagot kapag tapos na ako sa ginagawa ko tas nakatunganga ako. Open space pa set-up ng office kaya hindi ka rin makapag phone masyado. Kita nila kapag wala kang ginagawa. Ikaw mukhang tamad, yet they're not teaching you the other tasks. Kinakatakot ko na pinagkakalat nila na dumoble trabaho nila nung andyan ako sa office. I feel dumb already, yet their action towards me makes me even feel dumber. Nagiging comfort place ko na yung CR, I feel the most relax sa CR than any other places sa office. But every time I look at myself in the mirror I feel pathetic. Sigh. 

I have so many regrets. I wish I chose a better and bigger company na kasabay nitong nag JO ng pinapasokan ko ngayon. I realized that working in less than five people office (we're in the extension office) isn't the most ideal since matic all around ka, gagalaw ka beyond your role, and mahihirapan ka if past phase din. I want to resign kaso, I'm tied sa cash bond. Saka baka madisappoint parents ko.

1595,HR IS NOT YOUR FRIEND,"Saw this article and got some interesting tips:


For work-related issues, once you've reported any company policy violations to HR, I strongly recommend you go outside your organization. You'll get a more objective perspective not cluttered with politics.

Beyond that, it depends on what kind of help you need:

- If what you need is to vent: turn to your best friend outside of work, a partner, parent, or counselor. Often, just getting the issue out can help relieve the burden.
- If the issue is work politics: much of it just needs venting, but more experienced friends or mentors in other companies are great resources for advice on playing that game.
- If your concern is so deep that you are concerned for your own mental health: turn to a counselor.

1169,I am very disappointed with this sub,"CONTEXT: I used a different account dati when I got here. This is my second account

I was a regular commenter and visitor in the original Antiwork sub. I was happy with how the people in that sub are really serious about labor reform. Nung nakita ko na may AntiWorkPH, sabi ko, wow! Buti na lang may Antiwork na tailored for Filipino people.

Boy I was wrong.

I posted something sa aking first account about corporatist greed, at y'all know na I have a recent post about income inequality at school discrimination. Ako ay lubhang nalulungkot na may right-wing elements sa sub na ito DEFENDING the following:

corporate exploitation, social and wage disparity, employment discrimination

May nakausap ako dito about unionization at ang sagot sa akin job hop na lang at wag lumaban. Someone even said na my leftism is ""a phase"" at pag nagka-anak daw ako at ""older enough"" maiintindihan ko (funny kasi mukhang magka-age kami ng taong ito)

I have seen how united employees can topple oppressive management if we band together. If we didn't band together, we wouldn't have gotten out of an oppresive bond (na nilagay sa amin kahit hindi dapat) at worked towards better work conditions for us sa industry.

And mas nalulungkot ako na this seems like a white-collar rant page for yuppies. I don't see much content for blue-collar workers, esp factory workers and service crew, who need our help more.

Or maybe it's my fault na umasa ako na this is some left-leaning Lula worship sub. Maybe this grown-ass 32 y/o nonbinary person is out of touch sa ""reality"" aka right-wing tolerance kasi people benefit sa privilege.

Maybe I'm just a dreaming democratic socialist. Pero I'm not the only one.",230,107,0.88,True,Rant 😡,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/z36byn/i_am_very_disappointed_with_this_sub/,2022-11-24 09:14:32,z36byn

Here's mine: I was a fresh grad tapos I was applying for an admin assistant position in a small company. The interview was conducted in a Starbucks not far from the site, I was early and I was texting the HR person to ask where she is and also informing her of my location. After 30mins she asked where I am, so I called her. Apparently, a consultant will be conducting the interview and he was already at the location - he was at a table in front of me. 

Interview went horribly, he dissected my CV and was interrupting every time I answered. He immediately told me na I was not fit for the job and asked me why I was even endorsed for an interview. He then proceeded to tell me in not so many words that his time is expensive and how the company was paying him 3k per hour and I just wasted it.

1504,Recruitment process na inabot ng 12hrs,"*long post ahead! Irita ang ateng niyo ahaha*

Pumunta ako sa office ng company na to for interview and pre-employment assessment kahapon. Ang scheduled time ko ay 9 am, I was there at exactly 8:45 am. Kinausap ako nung guard and pinagstay sa meeting room nila. I'll be honest, hindi maganda ang building nila. Lumang luma na kasi, tipong pwedeng gamitin na place for shooting horror films ang aura nung lugar. The only good thing is, ang lamig ng aircon nila. After a few minutes, dumating yung HR nila, pinagtake ako ng mga assessments and pina-fill up ng ilang forms. Nasa 6 na exam din ata yun, if I remember correctly. Nung umabot ng 12 nn, Pinag-lunch niya muna ako tas pina-resume nalang yun exam by 1 pm. Natapos ako magsagot by 2 pm. Tapos tinanong ako ng HR nila if may prior commitments daw ba ako this afternoon. Kasi yung magi-interview daw sa akin which is yung HR Head ay mamayang 3 pm pa ang usual na dating. Take note na yung HR Head na yun ay anak ng owner ng company na to. Kaya understandable na late ang pasok. **(Ganun nga ba talaga kapag anak ng owner or ikaw owner, you have the authority to be late???)** Sabi ko sa sarili ko one hour lang naman, kaya ko naman maghintay ng ganun. Tsaka ayaw ko rin naman na bumalik pa, sayang din kasi sa pamasahe. Edi ang sabi ko, sige mag-aantay ako. Kaso lumagpas na ng 1 hr mahigit, wala pa rin. Syempre at nakapag-invest na ako ng isang oras na paghihintay, nagantay pa rin ako. Inupdate ako nung HR ulit, sabi malalate daw yung HR Head, pero na-inform naman na niya na merong for interview na naka-sched. Kaso wala pa rin, mga 4:30-ish saka lang nagdecide yung HR na yun na i-initial interview ako. Maayos naman yun usapan namin. Kaso ang nakaka-inis sana sinabi niya agad na hindi pasok sa budget nila yung asking salary ko. Kaya lang naman kasi talaga ako pumunta sa company na to para makita if mas malaki ang offer sa akin compared sa isang company na binigyan na ako ng Job Offer. Bale nalaman nga nung HR na yun na malaking factor sa decision ko ang salary. Sana hindi niya na ako pinaghintay pa para mainterview ng HR Head nila.

Pero dahil sa napaka-patient ko, to the point na nagmumukha na akong tanga. Naghintay pa ako ng mga 1 hr. Sabi ko sa sarili ko last na yun. Kapag wala pa, uuwi na ako. Kaso nung time na dapat uuwi na ako, mga magsi-six na siguro yun. Saka ako tinawag for interview ng HR Head nila. Edi ayun pumunta naman ako. Sabi niya gusto niya raw ako kasi kita raw na serious ako sa job. Kasi nga naghintay ako ng matagal. Edi ako naman smile smile ahahaha kahit gusto ko na siya sapakin. Binanggit niya pa na gusto niya rin daw ako kasi committed daw ako. Kasi magiging *breadwinner* daw ako ng family ko. Sa point na sinabi niya yan sure na sure na sure ako na ayaw ko magwork sa kanila. Kasing pu** porket ba panganay na anak at freshgrad ganyan ang tingin? Gigil ako eh, desisyin siya masyado. Tas hindi ko na babanggitin yun iba pang napagusapan namin, pero ang bottomline masyadong too much daw ang asking salary ko at eto lang ang kaya nila ibigay. *Ehem* 16k *ehem* 

Sabi niya magwait daw ako ng 5 mins at babalikan niya ako, iinterviewhin daw kasi ako ng sister niya, which is yung CEO ng company nila. Edi si tanga, payag naman ako. Kasi 5 mins lang naman. Nakalipas 5 mins, ininform ako ng isa sa employees nila. Ang sabi magwait daw ng 20 mins kasi kakain pa raw si CEO. Pu****** di ko na kinaya. Sabi ko pwede po bang tomorrow nalang kasi mga 6:30 pm na yun. Kahit pa na never na ako babalik if pumayag sila dun sa sinabi ko. Sabi nung employee na inform niya raw yung CEO. Mga ilang mins lumipas, may pumasok sa room. Iinterviewhin daw ako, part siya ng board of directors pero hindi siya yung CEO. Edi ako ngiti-ngiti lang kunwari di ako pinaghintay ng matagal. Kaso yung ""interview"" na yun, ginamit lang to buy time. Parang dalawang tanong nga lang ang natanong niya sa akin tas nagkwento na siya. Pu** di ko naman kailangan yun. Nagkwento siya ng buhay niya and kung gaano kahirap yung position na ina-applyan ko. Naexperience niya raw kasi yun. Basta it took 20 mins na naglelecture siya, ako oo lang ng oo. Kasi I have to be polite hahaha kahit gusto ko na talaga umuwi kasi pu****** nila.

Tapos nakalipas ang 20 mins mahigit, dumating si HR Head. Ininform ako ng balita na nakakapu******* talaga. Sabi ba naman sa akin, occupied na raw yung position na ina-applyan ko. Ang hinahanap na raw nila dun ay someone na may at least 5 years of experience. Edi sana nung simula palang sinabi na sa akin para hindi nasayang buong araw ko sa kanila. Diba!?!?!? Though, may open position daw sila na iba. Maging personal assistant daw ng CEO nila. Kinonvince ako na maganda raw yun. Sa loob loob ko pu******* niyo di naman yan yung gusto ko na trabaho. Nabanggit din nung HR Head na bagay daw ako dun kasi nga patient daw ako. Lalo na at perfectionist daw yung sister niya na yun at naninigaw. No thank you po. Ayaw ko maexploit at masigaw sigawan. 

Ang ending wala akong napala. Nakauwi ako sa amin mga mage-8 pm mahigit na. Tangina halos 12 hrs kinain para lang sa wala. Nabbwisit pa rin talaga ako every time na naaalala ko.

Ang maldita ko pero sana mabankrupt sila. O sana di nalang palagi masarap ulam nila. Nakakainis kasi.

**UPDATE:** Ngayong 8:50 pm, nag-reach out sa akin yung HR Head ng company. Iniinvite ako ulit for interview sa December 1. Ano kaya ang mas nakakainis matanggap mula sa akin? No response at all or ireject ko saying na I have found a much **BETTER** company?

Sana man lang kinonsider talaga ng management ang necessity mag-RTO or benefits ng WFH. Palibhasa marami sa kanilang di nakakaranas ng struggles at emotional pagod ng pagcommute.

Since 2x a week ang required need magleave if gusto mo magWFH sa minimum requirement. Kaya inuubos ko na lang ang natirang leave para makaWFH, pero ako lang rin lugi sa huli. Idagdag pa yung officemate na babanat na di daw ako pumapasok sa office (kahit pajoke pero nakakairita). Isampal ko kaya ang output at productivity ko sayo.

1338,Things that I've learned in my career,"Hello. I would like to share some things that I've learned.

- Establish boundaries: Don't be the Yes guy. Learn to say ""No"" for doing tasks outside your shift, on your off, etc. Once you start doing this, It will be an expectation and will haunt you for as long as you stay in that company.

- Don't take on more than you can handle: You are not the only employee. Don't accept taking more tasks than what you are paid. If your manager gives you several tasks, tell them that you have tasks x, y and z, and ask them which one do they want you to prioritize.

- Be careful who you rant to: Your co-workers and HR are not your friends. If you need to vent out, talk to a relative or close friend. 

- Use your Vacation and Sick Leaves: If your co-workers or manager gaslights or guilt-trips you, don't listen. As long as you delegate your tasks properly, it's their problem.

- Prepare before resigning: Ensure that you have another job in line before you resign and enough savings to cover your expenses until you start in the next job.

- Don't mix work with social media: Don't add your co-workers or boss on social media. You can create a separate account if needed. Also be careful of posting anything that is detrimental to the company especially in public groups. You never know if there is another employee who will see your post and report it.

Technology is unknown to boomer bosses, them looking at your screen with weird cryptic code which runs one of the regional office's important information systems means you're not doing work.

I'm a programmer, given clerical tasks which I automated(yay for efficiency, doing 2 hours of manual work in 5 minutes) so I can get back coding. Some shithead thought I was not doing work which for them means excel spreadsheets and word documents told our agency head and now my job is in danger. Lagi rin daw ako late, which is not. Maybe once or twice a month but lagi? No. Even tried reasoning with him that after I did other clerical tasks, I try and improve upon the said information system.

Yes, I frequent this thread kasi I want to be better (better HR, better person, better co-worker), and I thank you all for sharing your experiences kasi it helps me know the perspective of other people. 

Last month I met up with some work friends and had coffee. It was during a weekend so wala kaming pasok lahat. We took pics and posted them on facebook, where I was friends with some of the managers including their manager who they absolutely hate kasi attitude si madam. 

Earlier this week my manager talked to me and I was coached about how HR should always be the middleman, kesyo HR daw have to be impartial, lest management thinks we're siding with the employees. I asked her if this was about the fb pic, she said yes and that a complaint was filed kasi I was making kampi to the employees and management think we (HR as a whole) are taking sides. I received a well-meaning lecture about being impartial and being the middleman and making sure that our emotions are concealed lest we are deemed inappropriate. 

As far as I know that (meet up) happened beyond business hours, and what I do on my free time does not concern them. We drank coffee and talked about our previous work experiences and common connections. 

I'm seriously thinking if this job is something I want to pursue, I'm scared na it may change me into a robot - unfeeling, uncaring, always strategic and ""by the books"".

1003,I don't invest on interviews that waste my time,"I saw a redditor posted here about an interview that made him/her wait for four hours

I experienced A LOT of this during my entry level years from 2018-2021. I recalled the first worst one was I waited in the office for 10 HOURS and the recruiter/receptionist (yes, HR and receptionist is the same person) is slow af but I am not blaming her since it's the management's fault for not hiring enough people. The company made me wait almost all day and shit. I was super hungry and tired. There were pointless tests and the interview with the managers were SUPER SLOW. I went through like 5 interviews within a day.

Another was this small company that was in 2021. I went there inside the office and wrote the application form. I waited and waited and I was already sitting there looking like an idiot for 3 hours. I decided to walk out and text HR I am not interested anymore. 

I recalled there were common sceneries like this back when I was applying in 2018 but I forgot the company names. 

Either way, I wont let myself wait for more than 2 hours in an interview anymore. Since my goal is to work remotely, I am investing more on online interviews. I am not against on the idea of on-site interviews as long as the employer respsects the applicant's time. 

It's basic etiquette and common sense that interviews should be done properly and not let it exceed it for more than 2 hours. To employers and recruiters, please RESPECT the time of applicants.

So, mga 5 years nako member ng Online Filipino Freelancers. Semi active until recently nung may GC na. So sa last 3 months, I've been very helpful sa mga tanong ng mga tao dun kasi we want ppl to succeed. 

Nagkabadge pa ako sa GC for being active. Then last week may nagtanong tungkol sa kung need nila maghulog sa SSS and how. So sumagot ako tapos nagjoke ako na ""need mo talaga yan kaso sad lang na baka sa Maharlika funds mapunta""

after an hour, yung admin ng GC (who always talks to me kasi nga active ako) said ""ah ganyan ka pala"". 

To which I asked ""ano po ibig nyo sabihin?""

tas ayun biglang nakick nako sa fb group. hayy. 

pero yung mga members na iba, nagchachat pa rin sakin for questions. Sad lang na anlaking platform nun pero yung admin pala ano... di open makinig sa daing ng mga tulad nating pigang piga na.",80,31,0.97,True,Rant 😡,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/10g699r/fb_group_off_kicks_me_after_joking_about/,2023-01-20 00:37:01,10g699r
1563,"A guide on immediate resignations, AWOL, and abandonment","**\* Reposting this guide that I posted on the other sub. Figured that it might come in handy for AntiworkPH just so people are covered in case they are planning to resign. Adding a line or two as well about health concerns as a cause for immediate resignations \***

So lately I’ve been seeing some posts on this sub about what happens if you choose to go AWOL or file for immediate resignation for whatever reason. Thought of writing this simple guide for everyone on the implications and next steps should you decide on passing your immediate resignation for whatever reason.

**FIRST, why file for immediate resignation?**

As the name implies, immediate resignation is the voluntary resignation of an employee with immediate effect.

However, one cannot simply pass their immediate resignation and expect it to be valid without them incurring liabilities to their employer.

For your immediate resignation to be valid, your reasons must indicate just causes as the Labor Code provides. Actually, if may just causes ka nga, hindi mo na rin kailangan magpasa ng resignation letter.

**SECOND, what are just causes for immediate resignation?**

According to the Labor Code, these are just causes for your immediate resignation:

1. serious insult to the honor and person of the employee;
2. inhuman and unbearable treatment accorded the employee by the employer or his representative;
3. crime committed against the person of the employee or any immediate members of the employee’s family;
4. Other similar causes.

Na-estafa ka ng employer mo? Pwede ka mag resign immediately.

May libelous statements na ginawa ang employer mo against you? Posible kang mag resign kaagad.

Kinulong ka via padlock ng employer mo sa opisina? Resign na yan.

Di mo na matiis yung trabaho? May iba ka nang opportunity na hindi makapaghintay? Na-insulto ka na mababa ang pasahod sayo? Wait lang, hindi ka pwede mag-resign kaagad. Mag-render ka muna ng 30 days notice mo para wala kang sabit.

If wala kang just causes pero di mo na talaga matiis and nagfile ka ng immediate resignation, the employer can consider you as AWOL which can be grounds for abandonment.

**THIRD, what’s AWOL and abandonment?**

AWOL - as the name implies, it’s being absent from work without properly filing for a leave; it can be just one instance or habitual instances of being absent from work without following company guidelines.

Abandoment - a failure to report to work or absence without valid or justifiable reasons; there must be a clear intention to sever the relationship with the employer.

Magkaiba ang AWOL and Abandonment. While AWOL is not automatically Abandonment (since going AWOL just means na hindi mo sinunod ang company policy for being absent), it can lead to Abandonment if may balak ka talagang umalis na sa employer mo.

Being terminated for going AWOL is also different from being terminated for Abandonment, FYI.

**FOURTH, what are the implications if you’re tagged for Abandonment?**

Okay, the burden to prove that you abandoned your job falls on the employer. However, they can consider you terminated if they’re able to prove that you did, in fact, abandon your post.

Termination is not an easy matter, though, as the employer also needs to do their due diligence and afford you due process.

**FIFTH, how can an employer terminate you for abandonment?**

As evidence of abandonment for an employer to terminate you, the employer must attempt to contact you several times through different mediums (such as your personal and work emails, contact number, and last known physical address).

If hindi ka magrespond to any of these and documented siya ng employer, the next step is to formally provide you with a Notice to Explain, an administrative hearing, and if di ka pa rin sumipot, your notice of termination.

**LASTLY, what are the implications if na-terminate ka for abandonment?**

Like any other instances where an employee was terminated for neglect of duty or other issues like harassment, wala kang separation pay.

Irerealease lang rin ng employer yung 2316 mo and COE but hindi rin maganda yung record mo if your future potential employer conducts a thorough background check. While your 201 file is sealed and considered confidential information by your previous employer, it doesn't mean that the HR of your previous employer will not reveal your reasons (or lack thereof) for leaving during a background check.

You can opt to not include the previous employer in your CV when applying for a new job, but again, your future potential employer can find out about your stint in your previous company when checking your SSS, etc. records.

There are instances as well that an employer can seek damages, depending on your contract (especially if there are provisions regarding breach of contract; I’ve seen a few contracts where employers stipulate damages that are worth 6 figures, but this is an extreme case).

\--

If wala ka namang just causes for immediate resignation, best to render at least 30 days pa rin or negotiate a shorter window with your employer.

**BUT what about health concerns? Are they valid for immediate resignation?**

There are no clear provisions in the Labor Code regarding health reasons as a ""just cause"" for immediate resignation (to add, I do find it strange that there's a provision in the Labor Code for employers to terminate employees for health concerns if the ailment can be hazardous to the workplace, e.g. contagious diseases or if may sakit si employee that isn’t curable within 6 months. If you ask me, I'm of the opinion that we need to amend the ""just causes"" provision of the Labor Code to cover health reasons for immediate resignations, but that will be for another discussion).

However, this doesn't mean that health reasons are strictly invalid.

Should you be considered as unfit-to-work after an extensive medical checkup, then you can present your case to your HR and management as to why you need to resign immediately. Provide proper documentation as well, e.g. medical certificate, doctor's note. There might be instances when the employer will ask you to seek a second opinion from a doctor or clinic that's certified by the company just to certify your reasons.

The same goes for mental health concerns. Proper documentation is crucial.

Note that there might be a bit of negotiation required here as well since not all employers will be willing to bend the 30-day notice period as required by law.  In this case, proper documentation of your health reasons and a plan to facilitate the proper turnover and clearances will be crucial here.

In short, health reasons for immediate resignation are on a case-to-case basis.

**\*\* EDIT: What are the implications for a regular employee vs a probationary employee?**

Okay, so if regular employee ka na, all the provisions stated above apply.

However, if probationary employee ka at nag-decide ka mag immediate resignation without just causes, here are possible scenarios that can apply to you:

* Employer will still require you to render 30 days as prescribed by law just so you can finish work and do your proper turnover and clearances.
* Employer can offer to negotiate a shorter window for your notice period if they're kind, lol.
* If nag pakatigas ka sa immediate resignation mo without ""just causes"", the employer can consider your status as ""not regularized due to abandonment"", meaning hindi mo napasa yung probationary period bilang umalis ka. This would still require a paper trail though, such as the employer trying to contact you through several mediums.",100,19,0.98,True,Tips 🔔,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/10gkdle/a_guide_on_immediate_resignations_awol_and/,2023-01-20 10:07:31,10gkdle

1800,"Overworked, underpaid, and under appreciated","Hello! Gusto ko sana ng advice kase medyo mabigat pa rin sa loob ko.

Nag-resign na ko sa current job ko kase mababa pay and hindi pa rin ako makapaniwala na 500 per year lang increase ko. I stayed here for more than 3 years and there was a little voice in my head na ‘kaya pa naman’ or ‘baka maiba naman next year’.

Pag nakikita ko yung mga offer sa jobsites, nanliliit ako kase pang fresh grad yung sweldo ko pa rin. Hindi rin ako makatulong sa family dahil maliit nga. 

Nakakainsulto lang nung nagresign ako, need nila ako palitan ng dalawang tao dahil sa complex and laki ng workload ko. Hindi ko lang maiintindihan na baket kaya pala magdagdag ng tao sa same starting salary ko pero di ako mabigyan ng increase na allotted for the additional person to be hired. Kaya naman pala iincrease yung budget pero hindi kaya iincrease ung sweldo ko? Di ko gets. Magaling naman ako as stated sa feedback forms ng bosses ko pero bat ganon. Hindi nila kaya iretain yung mga taong matagal na. Mas willing sila magtrain ulit ng tao walang experience kesa iretain yung may experience na sa field and within the company na yon.

Ayun lang, nakakasad lang kase I made friends and earned experience na rin. Okay naman na sana kaso di ko talaga kaya mag stay sa sobrang baba ng pay.

1254,Work-life balance versus Work-life integration,"I think there are a lot of misconceptions regarding work-life balance, and a lot of people confuse work-life integration with work-life balance. And this results in quick burn-outs and work dread.

Drinking with your boss after your shift is not work-life balance. Having coffee dates with your work friends on the weekends is not work-life balance. And sure as hell playing sports with your work team/department in your free time is not work-life balance. All of these are examples of work-life integration. You integrated your work (your workmates) into your life, it's not a complete disconnect. One of the main issues of this setup is that it's inevitable to talk about work and it'll mix with your personal life even if you're not working. You'll talk about work while drinking, having coffee or during water breaks because that's what you and your work friends have in common.

Meanwhile, work-life balance is defined as the amount of time you spend doing your job versus the amount of time you **spend with loved ones or pursuing personal interests and hobbies**. A complete disconnect from the corporate world. It's about doing what you love/like without even a hint of work-related topics. It may be playing single-player games after working hours, doing your sports with cousins/relatives on the weekends, or as simple as watching Netflix alone all day.

I know even with a good work-life balance setup, you can still experience burn-outs, especially with subpar compensation and benefits but I think it'll help a lot if we start differentiating these 2. We can build a more solid boundary for bosses and workmates that try to contact us during off-work hours or teammates who try to hang out after work just to discuss pending work issues.",177,23,0.99,True,Tips 🔔,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/10wk61u/worklife_balance_versus_worklife_integration/,2023-02-08 10:01:59,10wk61u

1749,I’m at work and I can’t stop crying,"Gusto ko lang ilabas to kasi nilulunod na ako ng luha ko. 

We had an emergency meeting kanina regarding sa project namin, Government Project sya at nasa contractor side ako. Dalawa lang kaming naka-assign sa project worth 800M (3 projects combined) in total. Ako yung planning at yung isa site engineer. Meron kaming supervisor na nag-aalam ng lahat ng ginagawa namin. She’s a year older lang samin. Lahat ng galaw namin, at mga mangyayari sa site namin, dumadaan sa kanya. 

Since ako nasa planning, ako gumagawa ng mga as-staked/variation, una ako nagpasa last October pa para dun sa unang project, acknowledged naman nya. And yun din ginagamit ko kapag nagawa kami accomplishment report. From time to time, lagi may mababago sa plano, so I will revise it everytime. We had a meeting nung December na urgently needed na yung variation nya. Agad naman akong nag-comply. Pinasa ko din yun kinabukasan since lagi naman talaga sya nakahanda. Acknowledged lang din sa email. Ang palagay ko di sya nagmamadali. Meron din akong ginagawa bukod dito syempre, 9 projects yung hawak ko, so hindi na ako para laging mag-remind kasi weekly naman ang meeting namin. 

Last week ng January, pinasa ko na lahat yung variation nung tatlong project na yun. Kasama lahat estimate ng materials, mga bakal na gagamitin, lahat. Hahanapin na yan kasi malapit na mag-end yung contract. 

Sa meeting kanina, hinahanap ako ng Boss namin kasi wala pa napapasa na variation sa client. Hindi naman ako kinabahan kasi alam kong ginawa ko yung trabaho ko. Yung ginawa ko, yung bisor ko at yung site engineer namin nag-present. Ngayon, meron daw uli babaguhin. Okay. Go lang. Pero yun talagang pabago bago sa design ang nagpapatagal sa pagpasa namin nun sa client. Naulit ng Boss ko “bakit ba nagtatagal yan? Excel lang naman yan, mas complicated ang trabaho sa site”. Sabi ng bisor ko, nagtatagal sya kasi nga pabago bago, andami pinapalitan, di lang yun ang chinecheck (nya). Tapos sabi ng Boss “kahit na, pinagtatanggol mo lang yung gumagawa eh”. Pigil na pigil ko yung luha ko. Yung bisor ko hindi na umimik. Hindi man lang nya sinabi na nagpapasa naman ako. Eh hindi rin naman ako ang magdedecide kung okay na yun. Kahit makailang pasa ako, hindi naman ako may power para ipasa yun sa client. Bakit in the end, ako yung di gumawa ng trabaho ko? Sabog yung luha ko paglabas ko ng conference. Shuta naman. Sana pinagtanggol ko yung sarili ko. Lagi na lang ako napuputukan pag nale-late kami ng pasa. Last year, na-memo-han pa ako gawa din nyan. Sobrang unfair naman. Naging bayani pa bisor ko kasi “pinagtatanggol daw ako”. Shutang ina naman yan.

Pinagsabay ko pa nga ung boards saka work for a month. Pero good thing etong 1st company ko all about wellness kaya medyo supportive. Spent a little over 4 years din dito kay global FMCG company so sobrang invested at napamahal nako to the point na sabi ko nung nagresign ako, babalik ako someday kapag mas may ma-cocontribute nako. I left 2020.


Since I left, there were a couple of times na I had the opportunity to be interviewed dito sa company. First one was with my original company branch dito sa Bulacan. Hindi na ako binalikan after Line Manager interview hindi sinabi kung bakit pero most likely kasi mataas asking ko, which is justifiable kasi malaki na talaga natatanggap ko. 2nd one was THE WORST. 

Role was for the main HQ sa Makati. Nangyari is ung inapplyan kong position mismo meron na daw naka line up so inofferan ako ng ibang role during HR phone call. sabi ko pa naman okay to kasi ung Line Manager, nakakatrabaho ko nung working pako sa Bulacan branch and okay naman, masaya naman. My HR phone call really went well to the point na naging close kami ni HR sa saglit na usap. Nanghingi na lang ako copy ng JD, which was sent a bit late. Line manager  interview was IN 2 days kaya I didn't have the opportunity to really go through the entire JD pero upon unitial scanning very same sia sa current kong role, mas complicated pa nga current role ko since global team ako reporting and in charge of multiple countries while ung role sa Wellness Company pang PH lang.

 So eto na nga kayo na bahala di ako masyado maglalagay ng side comments:
1. Start ng interview kamustahan kasi nga it's been 2 years. Pero binweltahan ako agad ng  ""nagulat nga ako when I saw your application eh kaya sabi ko, sige na nga bigyan ko ng chance"" in a subtle condescending tone.

2. Asked me about sa nangyari the past years since umalis ako, sabi ko sige po pero bago yan magbigay lang ako story sa naging journey ko sabi nia again in condescending tone ""ah no need, nababasa ko resume mo oh hawak ko ngayon binabasa ko"" okay sige clear. 

3. Asked me about my role, listed everything else aside from what's in my resume. Sinabi ko din na on top of what's in my resume (kasi sabi nia binasa naman saw nia.) Then bigla niang sinabi nia ""almost same tayo ng tasks diba, tama ako diba? Andito sa resume mo eto lang mismo o nababasa ko"" na as if saying na hindi tugma ung sinasabi ko sa resume ko. Paulit-ulit pa sia kinocorrect nia ako sa ginagawa ko sa role ko tapos sasabihin nia, tama ako diba? I mean mas alam mo pa ginagawa ko kesa sakin? 

4. Asked about my strategy or strategic application of my role. I provided an overview of our strategy, sabi nia hindi pa din nia nakukuha ung strategy na needed. So asked again about the srrategy, mga 4 times kaming paikot-ikot sa question na to, hindi daw nia makuha ung hinahanap niya. Bigay nako ng lahat halos mareveal ko na strategy namin na actual kakasagot. May sinabi pako na ""LM due to confidentiality, I cannot mention any brands and other specifics""  kasi sobra na ung probing nia sa strategy. Sabi nia "" Anon sa lahat ng interview hindi talaga sinasabi yan"" and then went on and on.

5. She sternly mentioned na ""ang *company name* ay agency diba? So... "" medyo nagpanting na tenga ko so I cut her off  ""ah no po. It's in my resume, it's not an agency po, it's a global FMCG as well."" dito nako nagpaandar na global ung trabaho ko dito hawag ko multiple countries. Nawalan nako gana at this point kasi sa isip ko all this time  binasa nia at naintindihan niya, hindi pala. Tinanong nia pako if binasa ko ung JD sabi ko yes po, pero since hindi ito ung original ko inapplyan marami pakong hindi magets - intending to ask sana before the interview ends. 

6. Asked about a specific scenario sa company and ako nagprovide ng scenario. Sabi pa nia while asking. ""ung totoong scenario ha, ung ikaw mismo gumawa, ung ikaw mismo ha"" as if nagsisinungaling ako. After answering sabi nia ""ayan! Ayan ung strategy na hinahanap ko ung tangible na scenario"" edi sana in the first place un na agad tinanong mo. 

7. All throughout the interview, medyo dismissive na sia na ""kailangan kasi namin mas strategic mas inclined sa digital and mas strategic etc."" na if only binasa nia resume ko makikita niya na nag ad agency ako and may great exposure to strategy and digital. 

8. Finally LM asked what changed in me personally, sinagot ko and nag-disagree sia. Di daw dapat ganun, dapat daw ganire. Like, personal to diba, mas alam mo pa nangyari kesa sakin?

9. Ending I didn't have the chance to ask any questions. Naging coaching pa sia. Mas alam pa nia ung mga nangyari sakin kesa sakin. Sinabihan pako bakit ako umalis, kinlarify ko na noong umalis ako wala nang internal opportunities and totoo naman walang wala na talaga, ngayon lang nagexpand ung dept after almost three years. I used to work for 3 shifts straight for a 30k monthly gross for an analyst role doing all sorts of work na outside na sa JD ko. Unpaid OTs pa. 

I consulted with my fiends form the same company na exposed din kay LM kung ano tingin nila, sabi nila ganun na ganun daw talaga si LM. Pero parang nangayari nang-fish lang sia ng info. Checking kung ano nangyari sa mga umalis siguro. Nafeel ko personally is parang inivalidate lahat ng pinagdaanan ko. Sinabihan pako na ang opportunity pinaglalaban yan, dapat nagconsult daw ako sa HR. If only LM read my resume and the intro email requested by HR, makikita nia na lahat ng hinawakan ko na role pinaglaban ko kasi taliwas ung degree ko sa career path na tinatahak ko.

1011,How I developed my mental health issues at work...,"Working ako sa government for almost 4 years na. Pero ramdam ko ang panliiit ng mga taong nagtatrabaho sa gobyerno. Primary job ko, maging tagabudget ng opisina. Taga decide (madalas) kung legal ba o ilegal ang dapat pagkagastusan. So, bottomline, (feeling ko) essential ang trabaho ko dahil pag usapang pera at procurement, ako ang laging tinatakbuhan lalo pagdating sa mga legal bases. But most of the time, minamaliit ako dahil ""Taga Admin lang naman ako"". 

Dumating ang point na, I got depressed dahil masyado akong minamaliit. But I found courage, and I took MA. So, feeling ko, matapang na akong magvoice out ng mga opinions ko sa boss ko at coworkers ko na may mga doctoral degree. But every time na magsabi ako to which I know righteous, lalo kung may legal basis ako, it didn't matter to them. Telling me na wag ako masyadong makialam dahil taga admin lang ako. 3 years went by, I already developed anxiety disorder. Every time na may gusto akong isuggest, madalas I kept it to myself. Natatakot na akong magsalita kasi feeling ko, my opinions didn't matter anymore.

An incident happened a year ago, I was verbally harrased by 2 different employees. The first one cyberbullied me in the group chat, pero deadma si bossing. 2nd one was the worst, I was able to file a case against the abuser, but the case was dismissed, I asked for my boss's help, pero deadma pa rin. So, I got PTSD. No one checked me kung kumusta ako or what. They just told me, lalo yung boss ko, kalimutan ko na lang. 

As of now, 3 mental disorders ang kinakaharap ko. Ni wala akong nakuhang tulong from the agency I am working for. Madalas, nag a absent dahil kailangan kong makipaglaban sa mga mental health issues ko. I explained to my boss na kaunting pang unawa. Lagi akong nasa suicidal stage. Pero, at the end of the day, nireklamo pa ako sa HR namin dahil sa pag absent ko. Gusto ko nang mag quit, but my job brings food on our table.

would be a temporary wfh. They're looking for some medical documents
to prove na maselan nga yung pagbubuntis para payagan siya mag wfh,

1537,Manager/Team is forcing you to be an extrovert,"Hi everyone, I am 28F, No kids and working just for myself, working as an IT sa bank. I am an introvert, and my ways of working has been effective ever since.


Technically I was a new hire because yung mga current team mates ko magkakakilala na from their previous LOBs.

My manager 36/Gay (he identifies as gay and very open, no offense po sa LGBTQ+ community, just want to check if may bearing to sa nararanasan ko right now) he is forcing me to become an extrovert because my team mates are extroverts (they came from a callcenter setup before they changed career paths). 

Every huddle parang pasimple nya sinasabe na I am like a robot kasi isang tanong isang sagot ako. Yung mga kateam ko kasi, mahilig sa showbiz talk like machismis sila and maboka and sanay nakikipagusap sa tao.

While me, I just do my work, get paid and go home. I have excellent work output naman. Don't get me wrong, nakikisama naman ako pero hindi ko trip mga trip nila. Minsan kahit pag uwi ng maaga, inaasar nila ako, nagmamadali daw ako lagi umuwi. My reason is I dont want abutan ng traffic, and I live alone with my cat. Namimiss ko lang naman yung cat ko and I have to feed and see him since maghapon ako wala sa bahay. ☹️ 

I feel I just dont feel like a good fit sa work culture ng team. Ngayon Im confused if ako ba yung problem? Ever since I started my career naman, I have been like this and had been never questioned. I assumed kasi na bank to, mas accepting and formal mga tao? Parang mas naging okay pa experience ko sa ibang IT companies since never na question yung introvert personality ko. 🤐

Edit: during 1:1 he keeps telling me na I should be more outgoing/extroverted and speak up more during meetings.

1495,Stop waiting for the company to promote you or give you a raise.,"Your company is not your friend. It's not your parent. Stop giving it the responsibilities that should be in your hands. It has zero obligation to make you grow. Or pay you your worth. Your company is a customer that pays for your skill, energy, and time.

It will not negotiate for your maximum worth or even your fair value. It will aim for the lowest possible price that will not break your transaction. It's not being evil or oppressive that way. It's just how companies operate - by holding resources steady while minimizing resources to maximize profits. 

You, on the other hand, are the person who has a limited number of hours in this lifetime that you can use for work. You are literally selling the best years of your life when you work. To leave the pricing of each minute, hour, day of your life to another person simply because you think that's just how things are supposed to work, is nothing short of allowing yourself to get scammed. 

You need to maximize the pay for each minute of your life as much as you can. Maybe if you get enough, you might not need to sell all of it and spend more time for yourself, your passion, and your loved ones. 

What I'm getting at is this:

You have to stop waiting for raises and promotions thinking the yearly appraisals or your ""kind"" manager will eventually notice your hard work and skills and give you your worth. 

Make yourself indispensable then milk the ever living shit out of your situation.  

You have to actively negotiate more when you think you deserve more. You have to learn to sell yourself and your achievements and capabilities without thinking you're doing something dirty. 

Set up meetings with your bosses. If they don't want to, set up a meeting with their bosses. When should you do it? The best time for it is yesterday. The next best is today. Fuck fiscal years. If you're being underpaid now, you need to start fixing the situation NOW.  Be cognizant of what you contribute to the company. Do away with the ""I'm a fast learner"", ""I'm a team player"" bullshit. Tell them how much money you help them make. Tell them how much better they are now because of you.  Tell them how much your team literally depends on your output and knowledge. Tell them what they can get if you stay on for longer if they give you what you want. SELL YOURSELF. HARD.

Don't rely on the yearly performance appraisal bullshit. That's a circus to keep people just happy enough to stay for as long as possible. It's not a true negotiation of worth. 

If you can let the company know your worth and if the company knows what they're doing, they will be willing to adjust to your demand for equity. True negotiation. 

You don't need to threaten them with a job offer from another company to do this. Matter of fact, sometimes those even can get in the way. You will likely get a much better deal when you're still under their good graces than when you're blackmailing them for a counter offer. 

You can always just say the truth: if you like where you are, tell them that you want to stay but you think you can get more for doing more. Companies aren't idiots in general. They know losing people will cost them more money in the long run because they lose tenured resources and have to spend more money to headhunt, screen, and train. They will bend if your demands are reasonable and attractive. For as long as you make yourself important enough to be sold at a fair value, you will have the seller's advantage in every negotiation. Ask for what you think you deserve. Tell them what they can get if they promote you. Demand concrete timelines. Follow up rigorously until you get what you set out to get. 

And if, at the end of all that, you still cannot get what you want, then that's the time you go to another company. Because you know the true value of the time you have, and you are not running a charity. 

You are running a business. Your trade is you. Your product is your life. Do not sell yourself short.",111,7,0.93,True,Tips 🔔,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/127c2fc/stop_waiting_for_the_company_to_promote_you_or/,2023-03-31 14:12:04,127c2fc

1159,So we’re all fucked,"Pardon my French. 

But anyway, I was on r/phinvest where I saw a comment about how 80% of the Philippine population earns around 20-40k a month. This sounded roughly true since I see the pay budgets for roles on LinkedIn and job street and whatnot. 

Anyway, I did some research, since a lot of people were pressuring the guy for sources – and what I found was even worse. 

So for context, the Philippine Statistics Authority comes up with the Family Income and Expenditure Survey every so many years, and the latest one was from 2021, with the comparison year from 2018. According to the survey: 

– Top decile (meaning top 10%) of households in the Philippines earns at least 33k a month. That means that 90% of the country earns less than that on a monthly basis. 

– Average family income across all classes remained flat, while income in the top bracket dropped 5.2%. 

– costs supposedly went down for families, but I’m pretty sure this was before the rapid inflation we saw. 

Keep in mind that, according to an ABS CBN report, average cost of living in manila is 50k. How are people supposed to pull through???? 

What’s worse is that I actually know people who have more money than they know what to do with. These people spend a thousand dollars on a dinner and think nothing of it. Fucking insane.

1236,Work-life balance isn't real unless a 4-day 8hr work week is implemented,"Imagine, 5 days a week ka magwwork. Sa 5th day, pagod ka na, wala ng energy to do anything kaya magpapahinga ka na. The next day, you do housechores na hindi mo magawa o magagawa for the rest of the week. You laundry, dust the whole house, do errands.

1 day down para sa mga importanteng bagay. Tapos yung 2nd day ng rest day mo you use it to rest to prepare yourself for work the next day. Kapag mentally exhausted/burnout ka na, you do nothing all day.

Minsan magyayaya ng gala yung friend mo, so wala ka nang oras para sa sarili mo that week. Di ka na rin makakapahinga kasi kinain na nila oras mo eh.

I had a physical labor job before na 6days a week. Ang daming umiiyak sa locker room before work due to burnout, tapos minimum wage at walang benefits pa. Ang hirap pa kasi bawal umupo kahit wala namang customer.

Imagine if 3 days off mo, at least you have another day to spend for yourself. Work-life balance isn't real unless a  4day-8hr workweek is implemented. Your salary stays the same. Less burnout, happier life, more time for hobbies, for friends, for family.

1186,Are CEOs okay?,"I resigned in early January. In my exit interview, I told HR that one of the many reasons why I wanted to leave was the additional writing work that people kept trying to give to me that was beyond my scope of responsibilities. I told them how disrespected that made me feel, especially since it was encouraged by upper management.

Later that month, a former supervisor asked me to work on a project related to what I used to do for them. I accepted the gig and stated my fee, which they accepted. Almost two weeks later, after I had submitted the completed project, the CEO's secretary asked if I could write a summary of the project that would be shared on some platform. Since it was additional work, I required more payment and gave a quote. After a while, the secretary said that the company agreed to the additional fee but could I also write two different summaries for two separate platforms. Dahil di pa dumadating yung bayad para sa original project, which was 75% of the total fee, pumayag na ako kahit mabigat sa loob ko. Within a few days, I emailed the summaries and received the payment. 

In March, nung nagtanong ulit yung former supervisor if I could do a similar project again, ayoko na talaga lalo na't may emphasis sa message niya na conclusive piece/consolidation lang 'yun of all the other projects I did even when I was still an employee. It was implying na yung bayad ko this time mustn't be as high as the previous one. Also, bwisit na bwisit na ako sa pag-trato nila sa 'kin even as a freelancer. Tinanggihan ko yung project the next day and didn't bother to read their reply.

Then in late April, I received another email. This time, it's from the CEO. Somehow, he was prescient enough to add my personal *and* former work emails but in his message, he was addressing only his secretary: ""\[Secretary's name\], please ask \[Reddit user\] to revise parts of the project so it's short enough for my presentation at XXX tomorrow.""  

Una, nakakabastos na may kailangan siya sa akin pero di ako yung diretso niyang kinausap. I don't care if there are ""CEO protocols"" about addressing their so-called subordinates, 'wag kang magpa-pass the message pag ikaw ang may kailangan. Pangalawa, kung maka-utos ng madalian, parang pinapa-sweldo pa rin nila ako LOL 

I just deleted the email without replying and blocked him. Nung nag-text yung secretary nya following up on the ""request,"" I told her that the original project was concluded and paid for months ago and thus any new work such as revisions require additional payment since, *duh*, I'm no longer an employee. She asked how much my revision fee was pero di ko na sinagot.

1475,I personally witnessed someone's mental decline because of corporate abuse and unprofessional bosses and it's painful to see.,"Skl, need ko lang din i air-out to kase di ko na kaya nakikita sa asawa ko yung effects ng mistreatment at unprofessional behaviors ng HRs at bosses nya sa kanya throughout these years.

Ilang beses na syang ineendorse for promotion pero ang laging nangyayari paaasahin tapos too many reasons bakit hindi ipupush through until malalaman pa nya sa iba na tapos na yung hiring at may ibang inendorse yung boss nya. Ginatekeep din for months para maging lifter ng team kesyo inoofferan lagi na ieendorse na for reals and the cycle repeats until sya na mismo yung umalis. Reason why? Kahit sa HR may kapit hindi sya makapaglodge ng complaint kase nakakarating which in turn ang mangyayari iiintimidate sya sa coaching o minsan pag napapadaan.  Inencourage ko nang umalis kase lumalala suicidal tendencies tapos laging nagagaslight nung boss sa trabaho. almost a year din nyang binuno after 3 years of service.

This pandemic nagtry ulit, sobra namang toxic ng client na napasukan kahit WFH. Forced unpaid OTs, improper handling of HR-worthy issues, hiring prejudices, etc. Napakaunprofessional. Napilit tagalan ng 6mos until ako na mismo ulit nagintervene na pagresignin kase nauulit na naman na nagiging suicidal at manic due to overwork na di naman din nya macontrol since sapilitan sa kanila kesyo kulang manpower, may need idrive up, etc. Inofferan ulit na mapromote since may creds naman to back it up nung nagtry magresign, which is willing naman ihonor since lahat ng paperwork inarrange talaga para lang di umalis, pero wala talaga. Si misis na mismo sumuko, to the point na di talaga nya makayanan magapply ulit after that experience. Kahit anong offer ng company ng psych sessions post-exist wala naman na ding naitutulong mas nakakalala pa nga kung tutuusin.

Fast forward 2023 nakikita ko na nagtatry ulit magapply pero hindi nya kinakaya magpatuloy pag naiinterview ng HR. Either magbebreakdown sya after ng interview o buong araw syang galit. Masakit pa dyan ang laging impression sa kanya hopper sya kahit valid yung reason bakit di sya nagtatagal sa company (layoffs, dissolution, downsizing). Andun din yung bait and switch tactic tsaka interrogative na HRs na tatadtarin sya ng tanong pag di sya trip or obviously nagiging sarcastic pag nirarundown yung resume. Kaya nahihirapan ako iencourage magapply sa foreign/online clients kase laging bumabalik sa kanya experiences nya na baka parehas lang, kung pipilitin ko naman nagiging away pa. Nirefer ko sya sa online client ko nagustuhan naman ng boss ko yung performance nya pero di din sya nagtagal e nakikita ko na di nya kaya magtrabaho na talaga. Kahit simpleng huddles at short meetings nagbebreakdown na sya, o yung tipong matanong lang ng onti. Hindi ganto pagkakakilala ko sa asawa ko before kase naging katrabaho ko to dati, pero ngayon na nareduce sya sa gantong state after years of manipulation and abuse sa trabaho, personally di ko kaya na makita sya sa ganyang state kaya hanggat maari sinasabi ko nalang kahit ako nalang muna.

Nakakapagod lang din na yun at yun nalang pero kelangang tiisin. Personally may handful din ako ng bad experiences sa pulpol na HR na muntik ko na ikakulong kung di pa ko magpapalawyer but then that's another story.

Nakakuha ako nang pinakamababang performance rating out of 500+ employees nung 2022, kahit ako trumabaho ng mga collaboration projects with other companies, yung manager ko nagbigay ng mataas na performance rating sa akin pero yung pinaka head namin binago lahat and pinalitan nang mas mababa. 🤭 Kung tutuusin baka mas mayaman na ako ngayon kung granted lang lahat ng overtime ko simula pagka hire ko dito. Na-COVID ako dahil nag site visit ako and wala akong nakuha kahit magkano or any assistance from them. 

Bakit ba ako binabaan ng head namin? Kasi whenever na nagbibigay sya ng projects, umaapila ako nang maayos pag alam kong hindi amenable para sa amin and para sa team. Kasi totoo naman. Kaya kung kaya pero gagapangin talaga namin para magawa, tapos sya kuha lang nang kuha ng credits kahit kami trumabaho nun? Kapag naipilit nya gusto nya tapos sumablay, ending kasalanan namin? Kami pa rin gagawa ng paraan? 

Kabagsak bagsak na ba ngayon yung pagbibigay ng insights or suggestions sa instructions na binigay ng management? Kahit alam naman ng lahat na maayos ko rin naman sinasabi yung insights and suggestions na yun?

So, para saan pa yung data na sinama ko sa performance management system namin kung basta basta lang nya babaguhin yung rating ko?

1087,Threatened the company na e Dole ko sila. They got scared.,"This happened after my maternity leave sa eldest ko. So nung bumalik ako, lahat ng access ko need pa e activate.. I was doing nothing for the first 2-3days kasi I was still waiting for my log ins to be activated. Paid, because its not my fault kung mabagal nila mabalik log ins ko.

Now, I was told by our sup na I have to be on a forced short term leave without pay while waiting until when ako makapag calls. (BPO) I was really mad, super kasi I need to really start working to have funds and it wasn't right na pilitin nila akong ipag leave.

I was scheduled to talk to HR about it. Before that, I reviewed the companies handbook and tried to understand the short term leave policy. There, I read na hindi siya pwedeng forced leave. It's the employees decision to apply for it.

Fast forward, the day of the HR talk. I told them na I should not be force to take that leave otherwise i susumbong ko sila sa Dole. And the HR proceeded on saying na they don't have the say about the leave as it was decided by the OPS and they were just following it.

After the talk with HR, pinatawag ako ng OM namin and said na hindi na nila itutuloy yung STL sakin. Then, the next day gumana na access ko sa mga tools hahaha. So there, wala namang pag hihiganting nangyare from the OPS againts me but I resigned afted a few months since nag back to office na. 

Happy to be on a better company now working permanently at home.

997,HRs are the worst,"I have been applying for the past two weeks and have encountered unpleasant experiences with the recruiters:

1st company: Days after the interview, I did not receive any update and I followed up regarding my application. The HR told me they have already filled the position with someone and apologized for not informing me right away.  

2nd company: I was supposed to have my final interview but the HR cancelled the invite without any notice from them. No replies from them either.

3rd company: Someone messaged me with these exact words - “I need a business analyst. Send your CV to ***”. Wala man lang sense of courtesy.

4th company: At 2 pm, she asked me the best time to call. I asked her if 5 pm would work for her but she did not reply. So I assumed na hindi na tuloy. 15 minutes before 5, biglang nag-send ng invite para sa meeting, eh may iba na akong need gawin dahil hindi naman siya nag-confirm. Nagsabi akong hindi ko na itutuloy application ko.

Idagdag pa yung HR sa last employer ko na gustong ilagay sa COE ko na terminated ako dahil sa performance issues after being employed for a month, pero in reality nagtanggal sila ng employees dahil sa financial loss. 

Ang hilig nilang mang-ghost at hindi mag-reply. Ang dami rin hindi marunong sumunod sa oras na napag-usapan. Akala yata mga panginoon sila dahil lang sila ang nagrerecruit.

1359,Fuck all of em,"Six months in and they decided to extend my probation instead of regularizing me.
When HR summoned me at 9 am in the office, the HR head told me that my boss gave me a low evaluation and decided to extend my probation. Soon after signing the letter of acceptance of extended probation, the HR head told me to never tell what we talked about to anyone, the only ones who know are the HR Department (consisting of only 4 people including the head), me, and my boss. I sat outside contemplating about what happened. Soon my boss sat near me and consoled and asked what happened inside. I told him that my probation was extended, and he was all like ""Luh bakit ganun, regular ka na sa evaluation ko sayo ah, bakit nila iniba decision ko"" and he gave common lectures about HR being the enemy of employees.

A little detail about my boss, he had 5 different wives, 5 eldest kids, and is unmarried. He fucked a coworker of mine who has 2 kids and a husband working abroad.

Now then about our accomodation, the company provided us a staff house.

The only residents of the staffhouse are me, my boss, the mistress coworker, the new guy, the first company employee, and the boss' bf/right hand man.

One time 2 months before the extension of probation, when my boss and the mistress publicly labeled themselves as ""friends"". The new guy, and the 1st employee wasn't staying for a while in the staffhouse. It was only me, boss, and ""rightie"". Rightie told me to gtfo the staff house because the boss told us so, I asked why, he told me a random woman. I didn't believe him at that time so I didn't take his reasons seriously and left.

So I was forced to go home from Cainta to Bulacan all of a sudden. The president of the company called that night and asked me why i wasn't in Cainta, I told him "" Sabi sakin may iuuwi daw syang babae eh, malay ko sir, un lang sabi sakin kaya pinaalis kami"" (I didn't know that it was the mistress during that time).

So the next day when i went to work, the boss called me midday and told me why i told the pres, and the HR head that I ""tattle tailed"" him and he forced me to leave that night. I told him i didn't speak negatively about him, and just told the boss that what I said to the pres.

There were 2 new employees in our company 2 months before my extension - Ackie, and Newbie (the new guy mentioned a while ago); And just a while ago I heard they were gonna get regularized by the orders of my boss. I wasn't bitter with their regularization, I was happy for them because they deserve it. I was bitter for the management's decisions.

So imagine this, 6 of us in the staffhouse - me, the boss, the mistress, rightie, newbie, and the first employee ""firstie"".

Firstie was relocated to Bicol so that leaves us 5.
The boss does all the scheduling and designation of sites so he scheduled Newbie in the 2nd shift (4 pm to 1 am), so Newbie doesn't stay in the staffhouse throughout the night. So that leaves us 4.
Rightie fully follows the boss' orders, so when he was ordered to take the 11 pm to 8 am shift he fully followed. So that leaves the 3 of us in the staffhouse for the night.
He couldn't find a way to get rid of me. 
I could feel that they are irritated that I was blocking them from living together.

I'm pissed that I am voluntarily doing paperwork at home during the weekends, and I still haven't been regularized, and why because I was cockblocking my boss in the staffhouse?

I got a feeling that after the extension, no matter how much work my ass off, my boss will either end my contract or extend my probation again where he knows I will feel disrespected by it and forcefully resign.",140,91,0.95,True,Story 🗣️,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/13j1lj0/fuck_all_of_em/,2023-05-16 18:42:28,13j1lj0

1386,Si Toxic Staff ang reason bakit nag-resign and 7 employees ng company.,"HR Manager & I had a meeting earlier about one of my staff let's call her Edith.

Background lang kay Edith She's with the company for 3 years now. Laging above average ang Performance Evaluation ko sa kanya. And wala din akong masamang personal experience with her. Laging on time sa submission ng reports, na-aacomplish on time yung mga ad hoc task. Di mahilig mag-OT kasi natatapos nya work nya on time. I short, magaling si Edith.

So, back to the meeting with HR, biniyan nya ko ng set of papers consisting of exit interviews from resign employees (from other department), and one of the reason daw na nagresign yung 7 na employess (in a span of 8 months) is because daw super daw ni Edith. Meron ding mga insident reports na binigay sa akin about Edith shouting back at other managers. And HR is planning to fire Edith and need ng signature ko.

I have reservations kasi, una, mawawalan ako ng magaling na staff. Pangalawa, although I get ung malakas ang  boses ni Edith, I think it's because sya typical na probinsyanang sanany magsalita ng high-volume. Which I guess, na-mimisconstrue ng iba as ""sinisigawan"" sila. No-nonsense din kasi magsalita si Edith. Halimbawa may need syang report (for her to be able to do her report din) and alam nya na due ang report na yun today, straightforward nyang sinasabihan yung staff like ""due kasi yan ngayon, so dapat, kahapon pa lang tapos na para nareview na ni boss mo ngayon"".

I get na medyo bitchesa si Edith, but ""firing her"" shouldn't be an option agad-agad di ba? So I said sa HR na, I'll talk to Edith about the other manager's grievances.

Yun lang. Shinare ko lang.


EDIT: To reiterate lang. TAGA IBANG DEPARTMENT YUNG 7. YUNG TEAMMATES NI EDITH WALANG PROBLEMA SA KANYA. Other staff within my Department, wala din issue sa kanya. Yung ibang department lang. Hindi ko alam sa iba sa inyo, but I will not throw my staff under the bus.

1084,I hate colleagues who work beyond working hours (without pay),"I am working as a KYC Analyst in an international bank. For context, we were expected to finish one client within four hours. So sa 8 hours na shift, dalawa lang dapat ang nagagawa. Possible naman yun and I could finish one client in a span 2-3 hours. May ad hoc tasks din kasi kami plus sandamukal na emails pa, kaya kumakain din yon ng oras. Wala akong issue dun. Ang issue ko yung mga officemates ko na sobrang agang pumapasok (3 hours bago yung start ng shift namin), late umuuwi, at madalas nagwo-work pa ng weekends. At eto malala, nagsi-sick leave para magtrabaho. All of these are not paid. May OT pay kami, kaso ayaw nila magfile due to (1) nahihiya daw sila, or (2) hahanapan sila ng prod kapag nag-OT which is normal lang naman.

You may be asking, how the fuck does this affect me? It affects me greatly. Kasi yung expectation na natatapos yung client in 4 hours, nagugulat yung managament na nagagawa ng iba in 1-2 hours lang, wherein maaga kasi sila nagtatrabaho at kahit naka-leave, nagwowork so it creates this unrealistic work standards na dapat kaming may work-life balance, makasabay din. It is fucking unhealthy.

I tried to communicate this with the team, ang sabi nila, pressured daw kasi sila sa management. Eh tangina kaya tayo pressured kasi akala nga nila kaya naman natin pabilisin yung trabaho. At this point hindi ko na alam anong gagawin. Inalisan na rin kami ng option to work during holidays, kasi nakikita na nga ng management na wala nang work-life balance sa office.

Statistically, parang 80% ng employees yung ganito yung mindset, because somehow it gives them peace of mind, na di sila maghahabol ng oras during our shift at marami silang oras makipagdaldalan kasi tapos na sila sa trabaho, or whatever reason they have for working early or late.

Nagpasa po kasi ako last Friday dahil maliban sa mental stress, gusto ko nadin sana magreview para sa board exam.

Yung mga tatlong kaworkmate ko hindi din tinangap at ayaw daw ng boss ko na iwanan namin siya. Naisipan ko nalang magpasa ng immediate resignation at iinform sila about sa labor code. Natatakot lang ako na hindi nanaman nila tangapin or they might take it the wrong way. 

Ano po pwede namin gawin? Sobra sobra na kasi dito yung tipong bawal sick leave. Uso din dito ang sisihan at siraan :(

1704,Walang kasalanan si Edith!!,"This is an update on my previous post:  [Si ""Toxic"" Staff ang reason bakit nag-resign and 7 employees ng company](https://www.reddit.com/r/AntiworkPH/comments/13ksq1t/si_toxic_staff_ang_reason_bakit_nagresign_and_7/)

&#x200B;

Yesterday, we had a meeting regarding Edith's ""termination"". Attendees are - Dept Head 1 (Uno), Department Head 2 (Dos), HR Manager, ako, si Edith and her senior (Rev).  


Before the meeting, I asked Rev to reach-out dun sa 7 na nagresign and ask them if si Edith talaga ang problem. He managed to talk to 5 of them. So during the meeting, Rev dropped the bomb!  


All 5 na employees, every month may salary deduction because of unliquidated business advances na si Edith at Rev ang nag-bibigay ng data sa Payroll. For anyone curious, this doesn't need my approval, based sa approval matrix ng company kasi nga SOP lang to and employees sign a document na 2 weeks after the either the event / transaction was completed dapat mag-liquidate, otherwise it will be deducted from their salary.  


The catch? hindi tlga yung 5 employees ang nag-mamanage ng advances, pinapa-advance lang to sa kanila ni Dos at Uno, and most of the receipts hawak ng head and managers. Tapos hindi agad nabibigay sa staffs, as a result, kulang-kulang ang liquidation. In short kasalanan ng Heads bakit nagreresign ang employee nila. But Edith is not without a fault.  


Lacking tlga si Edith sa verbal communication skills. Walang tact minsan and minsan brass din. So we agreed na Edith will be assigned to a different team where she doesn't have to communicate that much sa ibang department (subject syempre sa evaluation, just in case ma-improve na ni Edith ang comms skill nya).   


But wait there's more! Syempre Hindi ako pumayag na dun lang magtatapos ang meeting tapos all good na. Since I already made some compromise by transferring Edith sa ibang team. I asked Uno and Dos for apology. Kasi putangina nila SILA ANG REASON BAKIT NAGRESIGN ANG STAFFS NILA HINDI SI EDITH.

Wala na ako malapitan at dun ko narealize kung di ako kaya ipaglaban ng management, para saan pa ang boses ko. Naging biktima na pala ako ng pulitika sa opisina.

1412,I really hate nepotism.,"Yes, you should always increase your social network and connections. Talk to more people, build friendships. But there is always a negative side of nepotism.

Ang hindi ko lang gusto, the top management would instantly accept someone just because kamag- anak nila yun or close friend. Despite the lack of experience and skills. Tapos ilalagay pa sa Senior role, which is very critical and dangerous. Goods lang sana kung entry level lang kasi pwede naman turuan ng mga basics, pero Senior role? Hindi ba delikado yan sa production? Clients abroad would not be happy about that.

The MAIN reason why they do this is to save time. I understand na sobrang stressful maghanap ng qualified applicant, pero ang daming wasted talent. Doon naman sa government jobs, nako po. Basta kamag-anak, pasok na agad. Kahit pag restart ng PC hindi alam. Tapos yung mga qualified, licensed with experience sana ay rejected.

I was mostly posting some views about international politics na hindi naman toxic or whatever but some friendly banter with other people I know, but I was just stating some of my opinions on whats happening globally especially on what's happening in Europe. Sinabihan ako to be careful what I post because I represent the company and etc.

When I first started working sa company, HR required us to join our company's FB group and add one of the HR people as a friend. This was mandatory. I immediately saw this as a red flag, so I did not give them my personal FB account. I have an alternate FB account that I use for co-workers and other acquaintances who are not close friends. I also did not use my real name on this account. At first nagtaka sila bakit ""alias"" ginagamit ko sa FB account na to and I told them I have a right not to divulge my real FB account because I made it a point that my real FB account will only be for Family and very close friends. They allowed it reluctantly.

So anyway, does HR have a right to do this? Tell you what you can't post on your own FB timeline? Lol. Ever since then ginagawa ko na lang when I make a post I exclude all officemates and the the HR from the company using the FB feature when you make a post ""All friends except...""

1573,Being guilt trip into going back to the office,"I work in an industry where it is expected for employees na magstay at work even after working hours for free because hindi pwede matapos ang workload namin during working hours. If someone goes home right on time, may maririnig ka na mga jokes from other employees like:

""Wow, sana all nakakauwi ng maaga""
""Walang uuwi, damay damay tayo dito (said in a joking tone)
""Ay bakit uuwi ka na, hindi pa tapos trabaho natin"" (again said in a joking tone)

I was actually annoyed by my coworkers kapag naririnig ko silang nagjojoke ng ganun sa mga umuuwi on time. Kasi parang kasalanan umuwi ng sakto sa oras.

Pero wala, nasa culture na ng office namin na mag ""sacrifice"" ng oras mo ng libre para sa trabaho.

Ako naman before, hindi rin naman ako usually umuuwi ng on time since mas gusto ko tapusin ang work ko sa office para mas focus.

Pero ngayong taon kapag wala na akong gagawin, uuwi na talaga ako ng sakto sa end ng working hours ko. This led to me sometimes hearing jokes above about how I went home early. But I disregard it kasi this year I decided to start loving myself and rest properly due to mental health issues.

Yesterday, I went home on time. I was the first one to leave kasi akala ko natapos ko na ang kailangan kong gawin. 

So today I woke up feeling good from my well rested body. Minsan lang ako maka full 8 hours of sleep that's why I feel happy for the first time in ages.

But then I opened my phone and discovered numerous messages and attempts to call me because apparently I still have to finish something last night which was not mention in any meetings pero meron daw sinabi na ako lang ang apparently hindi nakaintindi. 

My boss message me asking me why I went home when I knew we still have to finish something.

One coworker message me na ako lang ang wala sa trabaho kahapon samantalang sila nasa work pa silang lahat until madaling araw na.

And another coworker message me (mukhang umuwi rin siya ng maaga), kung babalik din ba ako sa office namin.

Part 2

Kanina, I was minding my own business finishing up my work ng pumasok yung boss ko sa office namin ng mga employees. He started yelling at me kasi nga umuwi ako last time. My boss even said that I did not even go to his office to say sorry for going home last time and many more but basically I should have known better seeing as I've been with them for years na. 

After saying (yelling) what he wants, he storms out of the office. My senior said I should run after him and say sorry then everything will be okay.

I refused, sinabi ko na lang may tinatapos pa ako. But in reality, I really really don't want to. In my mind, bakit ako mag sosorry, eh kapag nag overtime naman ako ni wala namang thank you man lang? 

Nevertheless, after a few hours of thinking since I still currently need this job, I decided to give in. Inside his office, he did accept my apologies and said na dapat next time bago ako umuwi on time magpaalam muna ako sa kanya. Or mag - ask muna ako kung may gagawin pa ba.

I said okay, but in my mind, I am already writing the template of my resignation letter. 

Ayoko na pala. Hindi ko na kaya.

**Update:** I'm sorry if I did not reply to any comments here. Thank you for your well wishes. Unfortunately, as much as I wanted to say that I resigned, I did not.  Wala eh, kailangan talaga ng job. Wala akong savings and still currently paying my debts to the company.

Nagulat kami, biglang nagpatawag ng urgent meeting yung HR. Pagpasok sa call, galit na galit agad siya. Wala raw kaming utang na loob sa dami ng considerations (bare minimum) na binibigay sa'min ng company namin. Tapos kami raw, isang araw lang na outing, ayaw daw naming sumama.

I was like??? Didn't they ask us kung may hindi ba sasama? I figured it was a yes-or-no question, and that we have an option to say no. Hindi naman sinabing mandatory pala. My 2 workers and I were willing naman na mag-work na lang kesa sumama, pero ayun, galit si madam.

I was planning to hit a year, but now, I'm not so sure. Ang babaw, pero ayoko nung sa edad kong to, wala pa 'kong karapatang tumanggi. Patawa sila.

Edit: To clarify kasi may gago sa baba HAHAHAHAH Hindi ko naman ni-request na humiwalay completely. Kahit sana i-allow lang kami mag-deviate from the group, kahit for an hour lang ganon. Kasi plano ng mga boss/management mag-rides, and hindi naman lahat gusto yun gawin. Some of us like to chill lang sana, take pictures, hang out in parks, play games, or eat sa food court. Kaya ko lang natanong if we can pursue other locations habang nakapila yung iba sa rides, para di sana patay yung oras while waiting for them.

1735,Software Engineer but doing Tech Support. Ingat sa title inflation and don't trust titles.,"Hi guys. Ingat lang po tayo sa massively inflated titles ng mga companies. When looking for jobs, magbase kayo sa Job Description, wag sa title. Kasi titles, especially sa IT industry, are bull****.

Background: I applied to this notorious company on their entry-level Software Engineer role expecting I will be coding and doing development. Instead, I was put in a niche tech stack doing stupid tech support. 0 coding, 100% ticketing and tech support with calls na may halong backoffice jobs like reports. Sobrang niche as in ma-pipgeonhole ka.

Sabi ko sa sarili ko, mag pa 1 year muna ako, then alis. Kaso I am not sure if tama yung decision na to. It's been 1 year and I'm about to resign, and mag-aapply na ako sa actual Software Engineer roles, hindi yung scam. Kaso ang title ko parin is ""Software Engineer"" despite doing mostly technical support. So ang ending, inflated yung title sa resume ko. Software Engineer with 1 year experience sa resume pero ang tasks ay tech support... 

Narealize ko what I did did more harm than good sa resume ko. I should've gotten out early, kaso the pay was good and I managed to save enough to stay unemployed for about a year.

The job has been clawing on my mental health every day since I hate my work everyday, and kada araw parang pababa ng pababa ang chances ko to get an actual development role the more I stay.

I am now about to resign, probably unemployed for a few months or who knows baka a year (wag naman sana). Going to finish my portfolio and try to apply again. Wasted 1 year of my career here. Nadapa pero go lang. I think this is the best move, kesa mag atrophy pa skill ko at mastuck sa useless piece of technology na to.

Please ingat lang sa predatory tactics ng companies. Hindi lang dito sa company na to, pero talampak siya sa industry. Actually there are now companies that have been lying sa Job Description so mahirap na talaga mapinpoint alin ang legit at alin ang hindi.

Yung isang friend ko na nakausap lately same kami nangyari, ibang company siya, pero napunta sa isang low code platform pero ang nakalagay sa JD ay pinagmukhang magcocode siya with C# and other relevant tools... Pero napunta din sa isang niche proprietary software at yung C#? Jusko, 5% lang daw nung job. So I guess kaya nakakatakas sila sa mga ganan, kasi tama nga naman, hindi illegal since may C# nga sa job pero hindi dun magrerevolve yung job. 

So bawiin ko sinabi ko earlier. Don't trust titles. Don't trust job descriptions. So paano? How do we avoid getting scammed? Easy. Spot them on interviews. Be proactive. Keep asking sa recruiter and busisiin maigi. Now most of the time clueless ang recruiter, then red flag na agad yon. Or paabutin niyo sa technical interview then tsaka kayo magask.

Don't let these companies prey on talent. Marunong ka magcode pero sa call center ka ibabagsak para ma-appease yung foreign clients ng supply of talented people who are overqualified sa job. This is why you shouldn't trust outsourcing. These companies are nothing but meat grinders who does not care at all sa talent mo.",77,61,0.93,True,Rant 😡,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/1489csv/software_engineer_but_doing_tech_support_ingat_sa/,2023-06-13 15:27:44,1489csv

1172,Supervisor wanted me to die rather to work from home. Chinismis pa ako sa friends niya sabi hayop ako.,"I worked in the company for almost a decade, I poured my heart and soul to the company and this is all I recieved.

Just a little back story: I fell inlove with my former company. The best part about it was the first half of my tenureship. Everyone was friendly. Heck, even the top managers were friendly to the point that when I tend to finish the job, my managers kept insisting me to sleep on the couch for the rest of my shift (this were the early days of my work, they knew that that was my first time working night shifts). Company was pro-employee. Unli breaks, if majority of the people were late (due to heavy traffic, storm, etc), top management would waive the latency. They were pro-employee  to the point that when you watch 2 company basketballs games, you get a total of 8 hours offset.  Feeling happy and amused, I gave them their kindness with hardwork and dedication. I was awarded several times to  point that it was 'normal' for me and other good colleagues to walk on stage. It really felt llike a 2nd home. It was fun and all until the FIRE NATION ATTACKED!

Good managers, Gone.
Friendly people, Gone.
Offset, unli breaks, Gone.

Fast forward to my 2nd half of tenureship:
Almost everyone I knew left the company because the rules and policies are not beneficial to them anymore. We had to adhere to the dedicated breaks, and when you failed to log in your biometrics from' lunch' to 'working' on time, there are sactions to be met (I don't mind this tho). They also installed a software wherein if you stop typing or just by moving your mouse, the system will alert the supervisor. Anyways, these are only minor stuff that changed. Biggest change were the management. Everyone left because of the 'new' management and the benefits. My last year in the company I recieved a whopping 500 peso increase. I was one of the top employees in the department. The insult is real Supervisors tends to gossip everyday. They even share other colleagues' sex life to us DURING MEETING. They tend to invalidate employees. When you are good looking, you are dead to them. To this day, I still do not understand their mind set.

I am a person who typcially do not mind office drama and shit because I tend to focus my life outside the office but their are times that I had to literally raise my voice to at least stop their wrong doings.

Fast forward to my last year in the company:
This was the realization for me to get out of the hellhole.

1. Covid is still lingering and we have a new born infant. My infant was too small and fragile. I asked my superior if it was possible for me to work from home, to lessen covid possibilites (I had covid from the office months prior). She said NO. She said that my reason is INVALID. I let it go.

2. Months later, I was diagnosed with several lifestyle diseases (heart problem, highblood etc) due to weight gain and a decade of working during the night. I almost had a stroke from one of the shifts. Even the doctors advised for me to resign. I asked my supervisor if I may able to work from home (we only work on site once a week). She declined and said that it was not a valid reason, even though she knew that I was having a hard time working on site. We had a debate and eventually I had to submit. Motherficker sent a wrong message to me with a screenshot of our convo and stating that ""hayop""  ako. She even mocked me for having a disease. She saw her mistake and immediately took down the message. She knew that I have a strong personality, she knew that I tend to fight when aggravated. I reported her to HR. She called and said sorry several times but I just told her that is is sorry because she got caught. I can sue her arse but didn't continue. I just wanted to leave the company. I just filed my resignation and left.

I had the confidence to officially leave because when I realized the company is going downhill. Instead of ranting everyday, expecting things to change, I put my energy creating a business. I worked during the night, and also work during the day. I am thanking the lord everyday for the blessing. We now have 2 branches, my employees are happy and satisfied.

Lesson I learned: 

1. Do not be a marty. If the company is going downhill, leave. Find a new job. Don't waste your time expecting for a change.

2. Whatever your passion or goal in life. Pursue it. Being employed is another word for being expendable. Find a job that treats their employees well.

1754,"If you're a manager and still think people who OT frequently deserve the promotion, you need to retire already.","Sa panahon ngayon where high-speed computer, internet, office tools, CRM, and AI tools exist, you really think there's no way someone can finish their task within 8 hours? Honestly, the only viable reasons someone shouldn't be able to (assuming they come in time) are: 

1.) they have a workload intended for 3-5 persons (which happens a lot in this Godforsaken country unfortunately), 

2.) senseless meetings which took away 3-4 hours of their precious time, and 

3.) tech problems like nawalan ng Wi-Fi, kuryente, office maintenance, and other shits that hindered them from working during their allotted work time. 

But other than that, a normal workload should be doable within a day. Tapos na po tayo sa panahon na manual ang paggawa ng lahat, and if you're a manager who still see OT as a sign of dedication, utang na loob lang, mag-retire ka na. You're mindset is probably still stuck in 1970s, which is 50 yrs ago.

If I were to choose who to promote between taong laging OT, at taong umaalis agad pagka-time, my answer would be, ""The one who submits their output ahead of the deadline"".

1030,"Idk, basta mag rarant nalang ako hahahah","For a year, I worked as the only Service Advisor for a dealership under a company that rhymes with Makeway Gators. Siguro, if you have or had a car you know whats a service advisor is, pero if you dont know what it is, it is  a mix between customer relations, technical automotive expertise and management. This will be important later. 

I started with the company last April 2022, i was trained at another branch since ongoing pa yung construction ng dealership i was supposed to be(supposed to be, 5 star dealership daw to). Training palang, i was dumbfounded by the lack of safety and cleanliness sa dealership; technicians na walang uniforms and safety equipments, no safety officer,  overflowing yung mga unclaimed unit, and worst of all, ako lang magisa catering under my brand there cause apparently, lahat ng under sa brand where i am supposed to be, already transfered dun sa dealership na still underconstruction pa.

There was someone, relatively new service advisor, who trained me for only one time and left me to fend for myself, on my first day. YAWA

I took the tutelage of the main service advisor on my insistance, despite him being extremely busy he still made time to teach me important stuff that helped me get comfortable and ready with my role. For the first month, i was relatively underperforming since may reccuring problem  si brand, DELAYED PARTS(PMS items, ordered parts atbp). Sabi ni trainor, the main S.A, understandable naman daw since i was new, and almost if not all customer that month was irate af kasi almost 2 months yung delay ng parts. I sucked it up, accepted it as a challenge kasi i thought, that was a once in a blue moon instance. 

Little did I know this is a reccuring problem.

Then the memo came around late april stating that I would be transfering to the dealership where i am supposed to be. I was happy,  i thought pag na transfer na ako dun, things would be better. Few days before the intended date of transfer, i scouted the place where i found out that di pa talaga fully finished ang construction doon. Walang parts department, walang cashier, no invoicing. I raised this concern to the parts manager, service manager and the regional manager, they said they'll find a way. 

They lied as naturally as they breathed

On opening day,  same problem, no parts department, no cashier, no invoicing yet nag cater pa din sila ng customers, lots of customers. Hehe, this is fine. Except not. I panicked cause i have no one, no managers to talk to at that early. I rang my managers number few times, no answer. I texted him and he said ""we'll figure it out"" panic went full overdrive. I considered even quitting then and there. After i calmes myself down, I devised a band-aid solution; i took my scooter, went to the other branch, requested the parts i needed, then bolted as fast as i can. Sounds easy, except not. I had to go many trips, madala ko lang lahat ng items needed for the service. 

Hirap pala me kargang mga boxes sa scooter, not to mention the danger it entails.

Remember i said we had three problems? Parts department, invoicing and cashier? 

We'll, i devised another plan. That involves taking the customer dun sa other branch, make them wait cause i have to invoice the documents, have then presented sa customer, then lastly sa cashier. Sounds easy. Well, easy naman talaga sya minus the beration of the customers ofc. Hahahahahahahahaha

I had a customer tell me ""pangit na nga yung service nyo sa kabila, pangit pa pinagdalhan mo sakin, it really reflects on you!""I asked for apologies, re-stated the causes bakit delayed ang service and why i took her there. 

This was my routine for maybe 3-4 weeks before parts department had transferred. By this time, i had made probably over 10 attempts in making my manager acknowledge the problems we had and have him compensate me for all i spent, all on personal pocket. 

Few weeks had gone by, we had already hired both cashier and invoicing officer, everything started to went smooth. Asked my manager for compensation again, still no answer. I had made my case that I am a service advisor, not someone who was hired on a supply run with no allowance. I was advised best to give up. 

The audacity

I grew unhappy, i felt that place is slowly killing my passion. But still i endured, me bills tayong bababayaran e. I have no choice but to endure, even if it feels like the darkest depths of mordor. 

I left them april this year because i dont want to be affiliated with them anymore. All the lies i had to tell the customers because of the incompetence of the management made a toll on me. As I passed the my resignation letter to my manager, I asked him again sa compensation. Still no answer, i felt like they already gave up on that. But for me, it was a very big deal, that would total almost a month's work of wage. Pero wala. Fuck me. 

Then months after my resignation, hindi pa rin binibigay yung COE and last pay ko. Nakaka init talaga ng ulo. Hayyynakoo

My focus now is to recover. I was recently diagnosed with depression. Once everything is fine and I feel like myself again, I will start putting myself out there in the job market and fight in the real world.

BUT DEFINITELY NOT IN A CLIENT-SERVICING INDUSTRY. NEVER AGAIN.

1136,Bakit galit ang boss kung hindi ko tinuloy ang job application ko sa kanila?,"Sa ngayon po ay janitor ako, ok boss ko at coworker, di rin naman heavy load ang work, pero di lang kalakihan ang sahod.

Ngayon job interview ko as graphic artist, pinappunta ako ng tueaday, eh sabi ko wed na lang kasi yun ang off day ko. Nag yes naman siya. Kinabukasan bakit daw hindi ako pumunta ng tuesday, wala siya wed. So nalipat nh thurs

Thurs nakausp ko production staff nila tinaanong kano rate nila, 350 a day daw, medyo masama na kutob ko.

Tinuloy ko pa rin interview, gusto ng boss mabilis maganda at marami magagawa sa isang araw, bawal standard kelangan unique. Tinuloy ko yung design test , umalis yung boss. Tinanong ko sa graphic artist nila kung kano sahod niya.

500 a day daw.

Sa isip ko pareho lang bg sahod ko so bakit pa ako lilipat. Mas marami trabaho mas mahal pamassahe.

So nagpaalam ako dun sa madam.sabi ko pasensya po di ko na itutuloy kasi same lang ng sahod ko sa current work which is janitor.


Umalis ako after a few hours nag pm yung boss via facebook. Bakit daw sabi ko pang janitor ang rate nilla sa graphic artist.

Eh sabi ko yun ang sabi ng ga niyo, bakit naman siya mag lie ano makukuha niya sa pagsinungaling sakin nung nagtanong ako.

Todo trigger si boss na mali daw ako dahil di daw sa kanya nangaling. Tapos sabi mag janitor na daw lang ako. Napaka unprofessional diba. Nung sinabi ko yun sa madam, hindi naman niya dineny yung sahod, sabi sakin di daw ako mabibigyan ng malaki kasi hindi pa alam ang skills ko. So 3 people nag indicate na mababa talaga sahuran. Bakit pa ko mg stay hanggang 5pm kung alam ko na na ganun. May karapatan ako tumangi. Yung office pa nila sobrang luma parang anytime magugunaw na 

Feel ko tama lang mga kutob ko e, kita ko rin na minimico manage nya mga staff nya.and according doon sa prod stuff madalas pa daw overtime. Gusto niya maganda mabilis at marami magagawa pero yung rate niya mababa talaga.

Madali lang daw kasi graphic artist kasi hindi naman daw nagbubuhat. Feel ko inuuto lang nila mga applicant para kagatin lowball offer nila.",264,62,0.98,True,Rant 😡,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/14an43s/bakit_galit_ang_boss_kung_hindi_ko_tinuloy_ang/,2023-06-16 12:35:07,14an43s
1031,Employer Hold my Salary due to internet issue.,"So as you can see on my previous post puro nasa Internetph na subreddit. My employer hold my salary due to internet issue from Globe. They found out na there is a problem on the routing mismo ng globe.

Work Title is Freelance Tech Support - freelance pero 8hrs kang scheduled to take in calls in a day without scheduled break or lunch. Bahala na si batman kelan walang masyadong calls saka ka lang ipapahinga ng manager. Worst is one time 6hrs akong nag straight upo, take in calls and omg saka pa lng nila ako pinag 20mins break.

starting rate is 110 pesos/hr pag nakapasa sa 30days training 144pesos per hourNo SSS, or any another benefits kaya nga freelance diba.

Policy daw ng company na i hold ang salary due to agent issue. Mapa Internet, Attendance, PC or headset yan. Ihohold yan without discrimination.They don't much care if ang agent baon sa utang or walang kain basta masusunod ang policy ng company.

My question is can I sue at least the manager dito sa Pinas? Also my first salary is delayed for a week kasi ung CEO daw namatayan eh nakalimutan mag hulog.  


  
Update : binlock ako ng manager sa messenger.  
eto last message nya sa akin  


 Let this be my final message to you. Im giving you 2 options.    
1. Continue with Serverplus and cooperate and learn how to respect.    Or     
2. decide for yourself and leave because you don't understand and absorb explanations given to you.

1037,working student concerned,"Hello everybody, I just really need a help.

I'm gay (but on process transitioning), turning 20 this year. 

I'm a 1st yr bs psychology student, and I'm currently studying in one of the colleges in manila. I'm currently working in the bpo industry pala, and it's my 2nd company na rin then I just started last week. As of the moment, we have a month and a half to fulfill my training and my schedule is day shift (2pm to 10 pm) then night shift afterwards (after training). Then in my studies naman, I only have 3 subjects left then good to go for 2nd yr after.

For more info, our curiculum is ... ang kada semester ay devided into 3 clusters. Unlike from other universities wherein it should be devided in midterm then final term. Hindi ganon 'yung amin. Then per clusters, we're taking 3 subjects. Just a heads up as well that per cluster is can be finish for only 6 weeks. (we just started this week for 2nd sem - 3rd cluster).

My situation is, I have classes during mondays and tuesdays; 9 to 11 am, 1 to 3 pm, then 3 to 5 pm. I'll be able to attend in my first class, as well as my 2nd class since I can excuse myself naman at makaka attend ako ng class at least an hour. Anyways, we're in an online class setup pala this cluster. However, when I reached out to my prof from my 3rd class (3 to 5 pm) she's kinda inconsiderate even thought ang motto ng school is ""Working-Student Friendly."" Kaya nga ako nag-aral ulit eh, dahil sa motto nila na 'yan. Nakapag stop kasi ako ng 1 yr due to pandemic at financial difficulties. It was during the class pala and the class is about to end at that time, then it was my first break naman sa work. She instructed me to reach out na lang to her after the class through email because there's a group activity as well that I missed, and she want to do the activity ng individual. It doesn't rlly matter for me if groupings or individual thingy. I know what I can do naman. So, I write a formal letter na lang to her instead so that I can explain myself as well.

So, my problem is, since training pa lang ako sa work, bawal umabsent, isang absent is equivalent to disqualification. So, I might lost my job which is I don't to happen because even if I'm still with my parents, I'm the one who's paying my tuition. My job is my source of income. Kaya, I really can't lost my job, kasi if ever, wala naman akong pambayad ng tuition. I have issues with my family din, but I don't want to add pa 'yon. Sobrang gulo lang talaga ng situation ko. Ako lahat umaako ng expenses ko and 'yun nga, my job is my source of income. 

Balak ko kasi mag transfer sa PUP on my 2nd year, and I have to pay my 2nd sem tuition ASAP para smooth na lang 'yung transition ko from my current school to PUP. Para less gastos na rin for me.

My problem is, if ipagsasabay ko 'tong current work and study ko, I might fail this one subject (3rd class). In addition, magkakaroon pako ng problema for processing my application sa PUP. On the other side, I can still quit my current job, so that I can focus on my studies then once tapos na 'tong cluster (which is itong 2nd sem) then go back sa pag-apply sa ibang company na naman. Ang kaso naman, 'di pa fully-paid 'yung tuition ko, almost 1/2 pa ata ng 2nd sem. If I'll keep my job, mababayaran ko sya and makakapag transfer ako. Ang kaso naman, baka magka-failed subj ako since conflict nga 'yung schedule ko, edi mas lalo ako mahihirapang mag transfer.

I've been trying to sleep since I got home (it's 5:04 am now), pero hindi ako makatulog. Hindi ako makapag-isip ng maayos. 

My only choice is to stop my work muna then focus sa studies ko to secure my smooth transition sa PUP, then apply sa ibang compny after this semester since I know naman what I can offer naman as an employee. Pero kasi, sobrang ganda ng company 'ko now. Sawa na 'ko kaka ""thank you for calling..."" kasi non voice ako dito and 20,000+ php yung current salary ko. And feel ko, magagawan ko naman ng paraan 'yung unpaid tuition ko sa school. With that, masesecure ko 'yung application ko sa PUP without any hesitations. Tapos after this sacrifice, less gastos naman ako for the following year. Or else, magbabayad at magbabayad lang ako ng tuition ko until I graduated. Tapos pag hindi naman ako nag stop mag work, pag pinagsabay ko 'to sa studies ko, may conflict sched naman ako. Ending, ma ffail ko talaga yung one subject ko which is yung 3rd class. Worst case scenario, baka hindi ko ma process application ko sa PUP. 

Disclaimer: My previous clusters are all morning classes kaya I was able to attend every class. Competitive pa nga ako eh. Points na nga lang eh, deans list na. Consistent honor student ako since jhs. Marami ring extra curiccular. Hindi lang talaga ako priviledge. Hindi lang din ako nabigyan ng magandang opportunity.

Please, I really need your suggestions or opinion. Sa mga former working-student d'yan oh. Nag mamaka-awa ako. Minsan napapa-isip na lang ako if worth it pang mag-aral since kumikita naman na 'ko. Minsan naman, iniisip ko na okay lang din namang mahirapan ako ng 4 years if magiging stable naman ako in the future. Yung work anjan lang naman 'yan eh. Pero 'yung studies, we can't deny the fact na mas mahirap mag aral pag lalong tumatanda. Atsaka, gusto ko ring mag retire ng maaga no, haha.

Maraming salamat sa pag-intindi.",0,3,0.5,True,Tips 🔔,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/14aw2i9/working_student_concerned/,2023-06-16 20:51:44,14aw2i9
1470,They really think I’m stupid or gullible,"*Sorry medyo long post/rant. I also couldn’t include too much detail..for obvious reasons. But I tried giving as much context as I could, without revealing too much.* 

Less than two weeks ago, I was told by our bosses (medyo flat org kami so maraming boss) that “you’re **not ready for bigger responsibilities**.” **TRANSLATION: “We will not promote you.”** SOME CONTEXT: Because they couldn’t point out anything regarding my performance (I met and exceeded all my KPIs), they literally talked about **personal aspects of my life** *during their deliberations about my promotion*. Example, one of them said, “Masyado siyang expressive.” (Source: The boss who endorsed me for promotion, who was honest about how those deliberations went down.) Note that this **isn’t** even related to my *personality in the workplace*. I have maintained and built good work relationships inside and out (our work is client-facing), in fact the bosses were actually curious about how I keep my team happy (we are in a very high turnover industry). In short, they couldn’t find a valid (work performance-based) reason not to promote me, so they resorted to nitpicking my personality and personal aspects of my life.

Today, they just **expanded my role** to help train new and upcoming managers. I was so confused at first (like I thought, “akala ko ba hindi ako ready?” and “maybe they changed their mind about my promotion?”), then it hit me…

So, this is the more **COMPLETE TRANSLATION: “We will give you bigger responsibilities, just not more benefits.“**

I couldn’t roll my eyes harder if I tried (I think I just saw my brain lol). They must really think I am stupid. Or gullible. Or both. That’s really the only logical conclusion I can draw from these last two weeks.

1025,I left the company I had been so passionate about.,"(M27)  I've been on that BPO company for 3 years, outbound yung set-up and they do sales and marketing. I applied January of 2019, at sobrang bilis lang ng mga pangyayari. nag initial interview ako around 11am, tas pinabalik ako for final interview at 10pm, mag-isa lang ako ininterview nun and after passing it, pinapunta agad ako sa training room for training and after 2-3hours training, inendorse kaagad ako sa production floor 😆 Since content writer for email brigade yung inapplyan ko, for me goods na yung ganun ka-iksi na training tas puro lang naman sample content ang pinapakita ng trainer lol.

After 2 months, nilipat ako sa ibang department as an appointment setter, something that I am not familiar and wala pang experience. But of course, tinuruan ako ng mga tenured agents and in fairness naka cope up din naman ako kaagad and was able to get commissions and incentives on top of my salary. So yun na ang naging work ko sa company until i resigned.

Maganda ang management ng operations nun though di talaga maiiwasan na merong power trippers, micro managers, sucker of praise, etc. Our Ops Manager resigned and she was replaced by a Fil-Am guy. He implemented a lot of changes especially on our incentive scheme at marami pa. Drastic changes talaga. Pero nung time na yun, hindi ko nalang iniisip since I still have our supervisor na kahit alam mong hirap na hirap na sa mga tasks because of the new management, she never missed to motivate us and she made sure na tama ang salary and commissions or incentives namin.

**Pandemic April 2020**, i was one of the lucky agents na hindi dinismiss ang contract. Sobrang takot lahat nun since di mo talaga alam kung hanggang kelan ka nalang sa company. At first, we were lucky enough to bring our equipments sa kanya kanya naming bahay, nag provide din ang company ng internet, groceries (kasama na yung mga na lay-off) at mga gamot. After 2 weeks, we received an RTO memo from our Ops Manager at pinag stay kami lahat sa isang apartment and the company provide transpo para sa pag hatid-sundo. I  think eto yung highlight ng pag stay ko sa company na yun. Thankful ako kasi di ko naranasan ang mawalan ng trabaho throughout the pandemic at nakakabili parin ako ng gusto ko.

**Post pandemic: October 2022**, my supervisor resigned and made a permanent move back to their province in Iloilo and as her fellow ilonggo, sobrang nalungkot ako nung time na yun. Since we no longer have a supervisor, my teammates and I were split up among various teams. The remaining supervisor did a draw lots system para fair ""daw"" yung distribution. So, napunta ako sa supervisor which happens to be one of the top revenue contributor sa company. At first, okay naman yung pamamalakad nya sa team and I got the support that I need during the transition. After few months, we noticed that she's already micro-managing us, lahat ng kilos namin kalkulado and worst is none of us can take a break unless we provide appointments. 

Meron din time na pinagmamayabang nya sa mga client na kaya namin yung ganito, ganyan na goal kahit di naman doable, so in the end, yung agents ang kawawa. Pero yung di ko talaga makakalimutan is yung pinahiya nya ako sa mga team mates ko... I mean, yes I made a mistake kase process naman talaga yun. Nag send ako ng calendar invite sa prospect kahit di pa na confirm or na qualify ng QA ang appointment, but eventhough ganon yung nangyari, sure ako na qualified yung appointment since the prospect already agreed to the meeting... Tas alam nyo anong ginawa? Nag send sya ng google meet link sa GC namin sa office, pinapasok kami lahat sa meeting room at dun nya ako pinagsisigaw.

 I said, ""pwede mo naman ipamukha sa akin ang mali ko na tayo lang... sa personal. Dinamay mo pa talaga ibang tao, ako lang ang may issue dito, diba? And nakita ko, vacant ang huddle room, why we can't talk about this na tayo lang?"" Pero sabi nya, para ma aware daw lahat ng team mates ko sa ganong mistake para maiwasan in the future. And I'm like, okay? Gets ko yung point pero di ko gets baket sa google meet pa ako papagalitan tas may audience pa lol tas di naman recorded.  

Sa thought pa lang na ""you can't take your breaks, unless you provide me an appointment"" madede-motivate ka na talaga, plus the micro manage at pressure. Just imagine na kailangan mo pang tumakas para lang maka yosi tas kelangan pag nag yoyosi focus ka dapat kung pano mo mauubos ang isang stick sa tatlong puff lang lol. Same goes with kung pano ka kakain (though we are allowed to bring food sa station namin pero sisitahin ka naman pag tumayo ka lol)

Ilang months ko din tiniis yung ganong style ng pag manage sa team. I was demotivated, unproductive, passive, anxiety, depression, name it. Until I came to the point na I told the HR about the ""No Appointment, No Break"" Policy ng supervisor namin.  Sinabi ko rin sa HR na gusto kong lumipat sa ibang team or department pero wala pa ring kwenta kase si supervisor parin ang masusunod. Sabi nya, ""dalawa lang ang option mo, and for the whole team... Either you work for me or you resign. I won't allow anyone of you to transfer sa ibang team."" And I was like... Na-shock ako. Meron palang ganon? I mean, stagnant ka na nga, wala ka pang chance to learn outside her team regardless of the reason. 

After couple of days, I passed my resignation via email. Actually immediate resignation yon. Ayoko naman talaga mag immediate resignation eh, di ko lang talaga kaya makipag plastikan sa supervisor namin if nag render pako. (Good thing naka hanap kaagad ako ng homebase job as Telemarketer and was able to start right away). Pri-nocess ko na rin kaagad yung exit interview ko with that company and I was able to sign all necessary docs para makuha ko ang last pay ko lol sayang din yun.

Actually, I have no regrets na umalis ako sa kumpanya na yun though at the back of my mind ""sayang"" kase okay ang sweldo tsaka malaki ang commissions and incentives. Pero nung time na yun, naging firm ako ang priority ko, and that is my mental health. 

Though until now, I still receive few offers galing sa ibang supervisors from that company pero I promised to myself na ayoko nang bumalik don. As of the moment, I have full time office job and part time VA job.",11,2,0.82,True,Rant 😡,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/14b5u5x/i_left_the_company_i_had_been_so_passionate_about/,2023-06-17 03:34:34,14b5u5x
992,Religious co-workers are the worst!,"Been working for 8 years na pero eto napansin Kong mga preachers kuno, spreader of good news, bible quoting coworkers ko na napakatoxic, jusko po!

Note: may legit na walk the talk na mabait naman pero bihira.

1st company - Meron akong TL na may mataas na katungkulan dun sa religion nya na may largest indoor arena in the world. Since newly, fresh and innocent grad ako, lagi nya ako niyaya magsimba sa church nila. Etong TL na to eh napakasungit and bias. Lagi ko syang tinatanggihan since I know this religion, once you're in, there's no out or pakahirap lumabas. So ayun, naging bias sya s performance ko and lo and behold, my coworker na same religion, lagi nyang pinupuri and tataas ng rating na binibigay nya samantalang to si co-worker panay ask sa akin! Eto pa, Christmas party celebration ng team noon, bigla nyang dineclane ung invitation sinceay Christmas dun sa invite pati dun sa decoration namin. Mind you, sya naghanap ng venue so ayun binigay nya Lang details kata bahala na Kami Kaya nagahol sa pagprep noon.

2nd Company - Big 4! Had this manager na religious and part Ng isang big Christian community. Etong manager na to, laging absent, wala sa office Kung kelan need sya onsite, sabaw magreview Ng work Kaya nadadale Kami Ng clients Kasi mali mali deliveries ng mga tasks sa kanila. Escalated tong taong to madalas, Baba pa magbigay Ng perf ratings kahit nag eexcel Tao nya. Nung one time naescalate buong team, and broke the news to us, sabi nya kagustuhan Ng taas ang pangyayari. Sa isip isip ko, bwisit Ka, ikaw may kasalanan, sa iba mo isisi. Nagpalipat ako Ng team after, sa minalas malas Naman, napunta ako sa bible quoting teammate na walang buka ang bibig kapag palpak at tinatama eh, ang mataas ay binababa at ang nagpakababa ay itinataas. Sarap ilubog sa kumunoy.

3rd Company - Angel in disguise. Eto ay isang youth leader sa Church nila na panay post sa FB Ng bible quotes and nagpepreach sa team since TL sya. Sa ibang team but same department, may isa ding religious na TL and these two TLs pag masama sila, mabubuting balita ang shineshare nila if there's a department meeting. One time, nakasama ko si TL na youth leader and galit na galit sya sa other TL na Di Naman daw nagwowork ng maayos pero naglelevel up Ng rank palagi.  Daming bitter words. Ako was tungo Lang since la akong pake sa kanila. One time , may chance akong makasama si other TL, and he was asking how was I since kilala nya ang TL ko na mahigpit and Hindi mapagbigay. Sabi nya puro bunganga Lang daw ginagamit Ng TL ko and chismis Lang ginagawa sa office which was nakakatawa. At the back of my mind, both TLs na religious are nagpaplastikan haha. Somehow, later part of last year, ung ugali nilang pagkareligous was affecting like if may Di ako natapos na work, sasabihin nila na Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for human masters. Nainis ako dito and Sabi ko sobra ung work loads kulang ang Tao! Ayun Sabi nila ginagawan Naman Ng parang. Eh putcha pag nagiinterview sila, after interview nilalait nila mga candidates so wala halos nahahire. Sila ung literal na if you can't practice what you preach, better keep it yourself.

The HR manager, which is ""tropa"" namin because she is so friendly and approachable, said to us na yung budget sana para sa training ng new hires ay ibigigay nalang sa OT namin because it is more cost effective. What the fuck. She resigned a week later. Kaya pala 2-3 hours OT namin halos everyday. Then I went to the Linkedin Profile of our company, todo flex sila sa kanilang record profits.

1590,“coworkers are not your friends”,"satrue lang… at nagsisisi ako

this post might be too long but hope you can still read it at the end

i have this coworker na naging friend ko nung unang year niya sa team. magaling siya, mabait, friendly, maaasahan, mapagkakatiwalaan. btw, she was a junior and i am her senior associate. both of us report to the same manager.

months passed after her 1 year, i noticed na parang she’s too proactive, which is good naman diba? pero i realized na she uses that against her colleagues and our boss as well para “walang bumalik sakanya”

now, kaya ko sinasabi na i regret becoming friends with this person kasi i realized na naccompromise ko ung work ko kasi there was one time na she asked me to join them sa pwesto nila para makipagkwentuhan. para hindi FOMO sa chika haha she even told me na selfish pa ko nung sinabi ko na kapag tapos na ko sa work ko, i can join them.

problema ko rin is people pleaser kasi ako despite me being a senior. nakikisama ako sakanila during breaks kasi for her parang issue sakanya ung hindi ako sasama sakanila. even pagbili ng coffee before shift. tas bubudulin pa ko kahit sinabi ko naman na sakanila na gusto ko na magtipid

so sige, magwwork ako ganyan and when i’m done, tatayo na ko sa pwesto ko and lipat sakanila tas sasabihin niya sakin, “oh andyan ka pa pala hahaha” in a joking way. knowing her, her jokes are usually half meant. friend ko eh, so kilala ko na

now, i had an argument with her earlier via chat (wfh kami both) and she told me na sana mafeel daw “nila” (not sure if she meant to say “nila” instead of “niya” mismo) yung presence ko as a senior. i asked her ano ba ang problema? and bigla na lang siya naglatag ng issue niya sakin and apparently, masama na pala loob niya sakin since april pa pala. she even told me na natatakot siya na maiwan ung other colleagues namin under me (she’s resigning na rin kasi). she also lowkey insulted me for being slow, which she knows na ganun talaga ako

hindi na lang ako nagreply sakanya kasi nanginginig na ako and at the same time, hindi ko na alam yung irereply ko. maybe she’s right, nagkulang ako. pero at the same time sa loob loob ko, i know i’m doing my job. for her, baka ganun ang thinking nya kasi one of the junior associates keeps asking her questions, kasi nga diba friendly at hindi siya intimidating. ako kasi tahimik talaga ako usually at RBF lagi. lumalapit lang sakin ung mga ibang associates kapag busy na sya or hindi na niya masagot.

Tapos walang transparency kung ano ang cause ng retrenchment at bakit na terminate si Employees like walang basehan bigla na lang tinanggal. 

Hello, registered po ang company nyo sa Pilipinas, napakinabangan nyo ang mga Pilipino employees nyo, baka gusto nyo sumunod sa Labor Code ng Pinas.

Pachismis kung nainform ang DOLE po sa lay-off ng employee at yung hindi nyo ginugulat. Whahahaha

Overworked na mga tao nyo, tas ang taas nyo pa maningil akala namin yumayaman na kayo. Char. Hindi nyo naman pala bibigyan ng good treatment ang employees nyo. Verbal nyong iinform at sasabihin na baka matanggal next year tas binigla nyo kagabi na walang 1 month prior notice. May sariling batas yarn?

987,Nightmare interview,"I’m currently job hunting and I applied to one company I saw online, all looked good they offered a decent amount of salary for a 5 day work week and noted that people with degrees are preferred (I’m undergrad but I have years of experience na plus a couple of years sa college) I passed my resume and may sinagutan ako dun na question sinabi ko na undergrad ako para lang heads up. After a while, they responded quickly. I was pretty surprised because most recruiters took very long time to respond. So I scheduled an interview with them.

Nung day ng interview slight kinabahan ako and I dressed up decently para professional ofc kahit mainit nag blazer parin HAHAHA so ayun malayo ang nilakbay ko papunta doon sa company apakatrapik pa.

Pag dating ko dun nagulat ako kasi parang ang hirap puntahan ng location tapos sobrang factory. Unang nag brief interview sakin is yung HR staff yata nila na mabait naman, after that sabi niya sakin boss naman mag iinterview.

Dito na nagsimula yung worst interview na naranasan ko. Yung unang questions ng boss okay pa e. simple saan ako nakatira and normal questions na maririnig mo sa isang job interview. Pagdating sa experiences ko dito na nagbago. Nakalagay kasi na I'm doing a part-time social media related job. Like kahit isang oras lang sa isang araw yung work (which I explained naman with her), gets ko naman na gusto nila focused sa work sa company nila. Aba'y sinabi ba naman na 30 mins lang nga lang lunch break nila para focused sa work and hanggang saturday ang pasok paano raw ibang work ko kasi wala na ako pahinga nga ng weekend baka pumasok daw ako na stress, pagod na nga rin sa commute at baka magkamali raw ako sa work. Di raw dapat nagkakamali sa work. I just said na lang some reassuring answers na di ko nga gagawin sa work time ung hustle ko and explained ulit na di need ng malaking time doon.

Ito na yung pinakamasakit, pinag usapan namin about sa free lance ko. Ang ending tinatanong niya kung paano raw ako pinagkakatiwalaan ng mga clients ko kasi wala naman akong degree. Hindi ba dapat daw mas naghahanap pa sila ng may degree kasi mas katiwa-tiwala yun? Yung freelance ko is about taxpayer assistance lang na tutulungan mo ung mga tao na maglakad ng iba't ibang transactions nila sa BIR. Undergrad naman din ako ng BS Accountancy and nasa pamilya ako ng mga CPA kaya alam ko and confident ako na kaya ko yung work na iyon.

Then comes sa salary, ang offer talaga sa job posting is 25k, bigla na lang niya sinabi na di niya raw mabibigay yung 25k kasi pang CPA raw yun and di pa nga raw ako graduate. Like wtf, offer nila sa CPA is 25k?! Tapos sinabi niya pa na kaya raw sila naghihire kasi umalis daw ung mga dating empleyado. Wala naman daw sila magagawa dun pero sinayang lang daw oras nila sa pagtrain tapos di rin magtatagal. Uhhhhh.

After that, binuklat niya ung resume ko ang dami ko raw nilagay. Eh ang nakalagay lang dun is work, educational bg, and importang infos like 2 pages lang siya and di pa kalahati yung second page. Padabog niya rin binuklat, nalaglag pa nga pen niya sa sahig.

Nung tinanong kung may questions pa raw ako sa kanyam sabi ko wala na kasi nga nasagot na ung gusto ko tanong sa ugali at pakikitungo niya sa akin. Wait ko na lang daw ng ilang days kung ano result. Sa nangyaring parang pangmamaliit sa akin alam ko di ako tatanggapin nito.

Then I received a text after ilang days, na pasado ako at offer na nga. Binabaan lang sahod and may paalala pa na bawal mag side hustle sa working hours and lagi tandaan ung work sched na 30 mins break, Mon - Sat. I need to confirm daw within 24 hours, gusto ko magreply na tatanggihan ko and just be honest but traumatized pa rin sa naranasan ko and ended up ghosting them.

Yung job post pala is 30+ days pa nakapost. Which means tagal na di pa sila nakakakuha ng bagong hire.

Sensitive lang ba ako or talagang unprofessional yung ginawa sa akin? Ngayon ko lang naexperience to sa 9+ years ko working and undergrad.

TLDR: Had a job interview tapos yung boss ay may out of bounce questions and comments about me working freelance in tax, having part time social media hustle and me being an undergrad. Like paano raw ako pagkakatiwalaan ng clients kasi di nga nakapagtapos and not giving me the salary kasi nga di ako CPA at undegrad nga lang.

1441,Attempted to hold my resignation and threatened me,"Here's my case

Our contract stated  ""The probationary employee cannot leave the company after being promoted as regular employee and/or if there is an ongoing project (employee must finish the given task)""

I'm a developer and I've developed/maintained most of the projects in the company. I'm on my end of my rendering period. I decided to resign due to the unhealthy environment. Palagi nalang nagse-sermon sa office. One time, I told the project manager about a task that is ready for QA:

>ready for checking also referral tree. data will update every one hour so there will be delay. let me know if you want to change delay

And he called to approach him tsaka sinigawan ako at pinagalitan. Sabi pa nga nya ""Do you want to fight office? What is this?""

So ayun, talked about the resignation. Before ako nag submit ng resignation letter, sinabi ng project manager namin na tapusin daw muna yung bagong project (which is malaki laki) tsaka nya i-approve yung resignation letter. I already searched online and hindi yun pwede, so I disagreed. Sabi ko hindi need ng approval yung resignation and it's only to notify the employer.

A day before the end of my rendering periond, the CEO and another high ranking employee called me for a meeting. I should respect them because they helped me and threatened me na something bad will happen to my life daw kapag hindi ko matapos ang project.

In the day of my end date, matatapos na ako sa mga tasks ko. We have this board for storing our individual tasks. So far, I'm almost done with all of my tasks, isa nalang kulang tsaka goods na. Pero in the afternoon, binigyan ako ng Project Manager namin ng apat na tasks. Sabi ko na hindi ko to kayang matapos ng half day tsaka last day kona ngayon.

So ayun, nag meeting kami ng HR together with the Project Manager. Sabi nya, hindi ako pwede mag resign unless matapos ko lahat ng tasks and tsaka need daw ng approval nya. Sabi ko hindi yun pwede, kase pano ako matatapos kung palaging dadagdagan yung tasks ko.  I stood my ground, hindi ako nag agree na mag continue sa work, and project manager threatened me, sabi okay na lang daw ako mag resign, they will just call a lawyer and file a case/complaint.

Ano ba tama kong gawin dito?

PS: Isa palang to sa mga scenario na naganap sa office during my 30 days rendering period. 
PSS: They also have a friend who is high ranking judge 
PSSS: Company is **Cubic Solutions** in **Cebu City**
PSSSS: They are no longer releasing my COE. It has been more than 30 days and the HR just told me that ""That's the instruction,to not release it""

UPDATE:

Went to DOLE. Told me this case isn't covered by DOLE and usually mga case nila is 13th month pay, last pay, separation pay lang. I'm also told to go to NLRC instead para ma check ang statements sa contract

1178,Cyberbacker is a dying company....don't waste your time applying now,"This company has been nothing but pure disappointment and chaos. They used to be the top. One of the great places to work with especially when the pandemic hits. But now, not anymore. People are leaving. Clients are leaving. Franchise owners canceling their contracts. It is a dying company. Slowly fading. I am still here working with them and it's so sad. The reality is people, the cyberbackers have been voicing out all their concerns and issues with the upper management. How can we improve the quality of hired applicants, how can we improve the relationship between the client and their cyberbackers, and how can we motivate the people? They even conducted a survey twice, but their solution is a joke, Those VPs, the president, and the CEO that you see being posted online are not doing anything to solve the problem. They don't listen to the people anymore. It's very unfortunate. Upper management is so focused on closing leads and finding clients that they forgot the quality of the service they are providing. They forgot that their main manpower comes from the Philippines and Filipinos are not stupid. It's true, this company really was one of the top. But now, their offers, starting it's very disappointing. They can't even compete with the standard rates other VA companies offer.

I've seen so many good colleagues leave the company. day after day. RETENTION is the biggest problem. I just heard from Career that their VP already resigned but everybody is keeping quiet about it so as not to shock everyone because it might signal mass resignation. I've seen so many leaders grow tired and left the company. People are forced-fully being reprofiled whenever a client or a franchise owner cancelled on them. On the recent ati cyberbacker thread it was mentioned their they have lost franchise owners yes that's true because my friends will lose their job at the end of the month. they are less than 50 people who will lose their jobs because of a client canceling contracts. I am not even sure how the management is holding up with all the negative reviews they are getting online from clients, cyberbackers, and applicants. I bet their social media team is all worked up trying to cover these reviews. If only they listened and addressed these concerns internally and really cared for the people then none of these would have happened. I miss those days when our company values really lived up to its core.

I'm not here to rant or to share confidential matters of the company. Just that I don't want people wasting their time to apply in a company where you will not be treated fairly and well.

1673,Apply to another company when your supervisor is like this!,"Spoiler alert! Long story ito pero detailed.

&#x200B;

Nagwork ako para sa isang government-funded project before. Ako lang nag-iisang IT sa team at sa buong company. Naturally, lahat ng IT-related stuff, ako maghhandle. Network, software, hardware, I'm your guy. Lahat ng tao impressed sa akin including my own team, our lab head, etc. Wala ako masyadong update pero magugulat n lng lahat ng gumagana na ito, automated na ito, etc. Lahat happy talaga kasi less work na dahil naautomate ko na. Pero yung supervisor ko? Tsk.

&#x200B;

Bukod sa pagpapagawa sa amin ng mga bagay na hindi na sakop ng contract at forte namin, magagalit pa siya kapag di namin gagawin. May mga times na yung responsibility ng isang kawork ko, ipapasa na lang bigla sa akin at di ko puwede tanggihan dahil time-bound yung project.

&#x200B;

Okay lang sana kung ganyan lang yung ginagawa niya eh. Pero hindi. Maraming times na uutusan niya kami na gawin ang isang task with specific instructions. Gagawin namin. At kapag nakita ng lab head namin na mali ginagawa namin, siyempre pagsasabihan kami db? Kapag nakita ng supervisor namin na pinagsasabihan kami ng lab head namin, kahit siya nagutos na gawin namin yun at paano namin dapat gagawin, papagalitan niya rin kami. Imbis na aminin niya na siya nagutos, siya pa magagalit sa amin, sarap db?

&#x200B;

May time pa na inutusan niya ako ""Gawin mo si Task A"". After a couple of days bigla niyang sinabi ""Tigilan mo muna yan si Task A, higher priority si Task B"". So tinigilan ko na completely si Task A at 100% ng effort ng team, nakafocus sa Task B. Next week biglang nagtanong siya sa amin ""Nasaan na yung output ni Task A?"" Sabi ko ""Sabi niyo po tigilan ko muna si Task A at gawin si Task B?"" Sabi niya ""Kailangan natin yung output ni Task A!"" So... tinigilan ko si Task B at nilagay ko yung efforts ko kay Task A. Pagkatapos ng ilang araw sinabihan niya ako ""Diba sinabihan kita na tulungan mo kateam mo sa Task B?! Higher priority nga yun bakit hindi mo yun ginagawa?!"" Naging back and forth na ganito yung convo hanggang buong team nagsplit na para kalahati gagawa ng task A at kalahati gagawa ng Task B.

Yung turning point ko para magresign at maghanap ng bagong company is dahil dito sa next na kwento. Kailangan namin maginstall ng isang bagong system sa field. Okay lang sana eh. Pero ang gusto niya mainstall eh, untested, unverified, at incomplete na project. Wala rin yung kawork ko na nakatoka dito, kaya sabi ng lahat including lab head namin ""Hintayin natin makabalik yung isang member para maassemble natin dito at kapag working na, ideploy na natin sa field"". Kaso, ayaw ng supervisor namin na ganun. Sabi niya ako na lang daw maginstall may alam naman daw ako sa ginagawa ng kawork ko. Sabi ko ""Sige po. Pero pwd po ba pahingi ng diagram para alam ko ano dadalhin ko sa field?"" Sabi niya ""Bigay ko na lang sa field"". Dun pa lang, hesitant na ako. Pero sabi ko na lang ""Sige po. Ano po kailangan ko na mga dalhin sa field?"" Binigyan ako ng list at napack ko na lahat ng gamit sa list na yun. Okay na lahat. Pagkarating sa field hiningi ko uli yung diagram. To my surprise, sobrang daming kulang. Like NO SHIT, 70% ng kailangan wala.

Nireport ko agad yun sa lab head at supervisor namin. Alam niyo sabi ng supervisor namin? ""Ano gagawin natin kung hindi mo yan mainstall?!"" Dahil nasa field na kami sabi ko n lang ""Sige po, subukan ko gawan ng paraan"". Ang reply ng supervisor namin ""Gawan mo ng paraan"". After a couple of days, almost complete na yung system. Integration na lang sa existing system namin yung kulang. Tinanong ko supervisor namin kung paano. Sabi, tanungin yung owner ng system. So tinanong ko, at guess what? Nagalburuto sa galit yung owner ng system. Tinatanong kami kung natest ba yung system, pano natest, verified ba ito, etc etc. Makikita mo sa group chat na nangsseen lang yung supervisor namin habang kami pinapagalitan na. Nung humupa na yung galit ng owner, biglang nagmessage supervisor namin ""We need to plan carefully before installing another system to our existing system"". Di na kami sinalo habang nagagalit yung system owner, ang bilis pa magmalinis ng kupal. Sarap mo sakalin kung alam mo lang.

&#x200B;

Dahil dun sa mga ginawa ng supervisor ko, naburnout ako, Kahit sarili kong skills nagddoubt ako. Kahit ako lang nakapagpagana ng mga stuff na hindi napagana ng pinalitan kong tao, doubtful ako sa sarili ko.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to today. Nagend na contract ko dun (well government). Ngayon nasa corporate na, mas malaki sahod, maganda benefits, at dahil sa performance ko sinabihan ako ng mga managers ""He's really good! He learns fast and he can even be utilized by multiple teams!"". Dahil rin sa performance ko, kasama ako sa mga mabibigyan ng exceptions at promotions this year kahit walang salary increase at on-hold ang promotions ng malaking percentage ng company.

&#x200B;

Lesson learned, kung di ka naaappreciate sa isang lugar, lipat ka bago ka maubos. May mahahanap ka rin na makakaappreciate sayo at sa performance mo. Parang love life lang rin hahahahaha!

1390,Kabulastugan ng Managers sa Jollibee,"Since trending ang jollibee dito sa antiwork. Let me share with you guys yung kalokohan ng mga managers sa branch namin.

May pa-uso sila na pagdating ng out mo, need mo bumunot ng isang special task bago ka magout. WTF, out ka na nga may extra task ka pa imbis sana na ipapahinga mo nalang pauwi sa jeep. Kala mo naman may bayad. Napaka random nung task and it can range from easy to hard. Easiest siguro would be cleaning the center island or tamang punas lang sa ibang station or refill lang ng utensils. Hardest would be cleaning the grease trap or bathroom or maglampso sa buong dining area. Mapapakamot ka nalang since wala naman yong bayad.

Isa pang kaputangenahan ng managers is yung pag may excess yung kitchen na nalutong pagkain na maglalapse na tas biglang naubos yung peak ng customer. Pipilitin kang bumili ng manager, salary deduction naman daw. Syempre ikaw naman na patay gutom at pagud na pagod sa pagttrabaho, maeengganyo ka sa pamimilit nila. Wala kang no choice. Di bali sana kung may discount. Bat kaya hindi sila yung bumili? Samin pa ipapabili alam namang kakarampot lang ang sahod namin.

Last nalang. Alam kong at fault din kami ditong mga crew pero please hear us out. Itong mga walang magawang manager na to. Kinuntsaba yung mga regular crews na painan kami. Naglagay sila ng untouched food sa isang table. Yumburger ata yun + C1. Tapos kaming mga dining nagtataka bakit 1hr mahigit na wala pa ring customer na gumagalaw sa table na yun. Kala namin naiwan ng customer. Policy kasi dyan is if matagal na unattended, need na i-clear yung table. In short itapon na yung ano mang natirang pagkain dun. Syempre kaming mga crew ulit na patay gustom, nanghihinayang kasi di naman na galaw eh bat naman kailangan itapon. So itong isa kong katrabaho, itinakas tapos dinala sa storage room. Tinimbrehan kami na isa isang pumasok para kumagat doon sa burger. Kinabukasan pag pasok namin, burado na mga schedule namin. Sisante na daw kami. Tong mga damuhong manager at crew pala, pinapanuod kami sa cctv habang nagtatawanan. Di ko sure kung nasa katwiran ba ko pero di ko maiwasang sumama yung loob. Di naman kami nagnakaw, bat nila kami kailangan painan ng ganun. Being a manager alam naman nilang nagpapakahirap kami para sa kakarampot na sahod since most of us gaya ko ay working student lang naman. Ano bang mapapatunayan nila sa pagpapain ng ganun? na patay gutom kami? Wala naman kaming ninakaw men. Di ba nila naaalala na kami yung sumasalo pag may sobrang nalutong food para maging perfect yung rating nila sa waste, na may extra tasks kami every time na mag oout na sa work , na kahit anong utos nila ginagawa naman namin.

So yun lang. Thankful na rin na natanggal ako sa jbee. If ever siguro na nagstay ako dun, baka di ako nakatapos ng college kasi mahihirapan akong pagsabayin. Saka baka mawili ako sa kakarampot na kita at magdecide maging manager din lol.

Edit:For those asking po kung saang branch, not sure kung dapat ko ba i-reveal kasi 2013 pa to, sila yung pinaka last ko na experience sa pagiging service crew. Di na ko umulit. Just reminiscing kung gano kalala sila samin dati since trending ngayon ulit yung jbee. Not sure ako kung sila sila pa rin ang managers or kung ganto pa rin ba kalala yung kalakaran pag franchise.

Compared sa sahod ng iba syempre maliit lang talaga yun at totoo namang di enough yon to live comfortably in this era. Pero alam naman natin, di naman talaga agad nabibigay yon sa karamihan.

4yrs na sya nagwowork, 2 companies na yon. Sa last one, puro lawyers mga kasama nya and they told her na mag ask ng much higher pay pag maghahanap na ulit sya ng work, mga 25k, and wag na wag na tatanggap ng mas mababa sa 23k dahil yun yung salary nya, lalo na kung need nya bumyahe everyday. They also told her na maging confident pagdating sa bagay na yan dahil confident din sila sa skills na meron sya. Maraming pwedeng ebidensya, like payslip, and yung previous employer nya. Kahit mag background check pa sila. Pero di na sya binigyan ng pagkakataon ng manager na to. And she was so upset to the point na ayaw na nyang magsalita kasi iiyak sya the moment na magsalita sya. 

Bago sya maghanap ng bagong work, nagpahinga muna sya for a few months to start a small business with her bf, while doing a freelance job as her side hustle. Nung naging okay na yung small business nila, tsaka sya ulit nagtry mag apply and natutuwa sya na may mga naiinvite na ulit sa kanya for interview. Ito nga yung unang company. Excited pa man din sya.

Tapos umuwi syang pinagdududahan yung sarili nya. Nanliliit sya. I felt really bad. Ineencourage nalang din namin sya ng paulit ulit ng fam na she is good at deserve nya yung mga blessings na nareceive nya before. She's very active and madiskarte. Pero this manager ruined her confidence talaga that day. Awang awa ako sa kapatid ko.

Bihira sya magkwento sakin, pero right after her interview, hinanap nya agad ako to tell me kung ano nangyari. Sobrang nakakabasag mga ganitong tao. Di ko rin alam bat sumagi pa sa madumi nyang bibig yung Papa ko. At mali sya sa akala nya na ganyan ang sasabihin ng Papa namin, kasi very supportive din yon.

1055,"Please, iwasan ninyo company na to. For your own good."," 

**My Busy Bee.**(name of company)
(https://www.mybusybee.net/)

This is a story of my friend na matagal nang nag resign sa company. Glad this friend of mine is in a much better place na din. Sabi niya, if diko lang talaga kailangan ng pera umalis nako ng mas maaga.

Just sharing this to you as well para hindi na niyo maranasan yung hirap.

**Some Red Flags**

* CEO doesn't believe in mental health. ""Sana huwag kayong maging ganyan, yung millenial na generation ninyo ang daming alam, kunting struggle lang post agad. Huwag ninyo ipapasa yan sa mga anak ninyo""(verbatim but yeah, you get it)

**Grabe OT Culture**

* Some were working OT without pay, people get mentioned in GC during the weekends at 2:00 am, 3 AM.
* Kahit daw hindi emergency,nanamemention siya sa gc.
* OT is encouraged, to the point na minsan nahihiya yung mga employees na mag file ng OT pay. OT should be filed before the OT happens pero minsan - pinag OOT ka bigla tapos natatawagan ka pa daw on week-ends.

**Gaslighting**

* ""Sana yung dedication ninyo hindi lang pang 8-5. Kasi yung mga output natin is tumutulong sa government and sa mga kababayan natin.""
* May paloyalty pledge daw rin sila
* “Remeber, an ounce of loyalty is worth a pound of cleverness”
* “If you work for a man, in heaven’s name, work for him, speak well for him, and stand by the institution he represents”

WTF

**Very Intrusive Monitoring Apps.**

* They use Desktime. Takes screenshots of your pc/laptop every 3 minutes. Kapag na idle ka for a bit, ang laki ng bawas sa productivity rate mo. Need to be moving your mouse/keyboard raw para lang ma meet yung productivity rate. (needs to be at 90% palagi, if not hindi ka considered perfect attendance for the incentive)
* Minomonitor yung mga websites you visit while using desktime. This friend of mine told me nagpapamusic siya kapag nagwowork - and nakalimutan niya yung policy opened youtube for 10 secs before closing, result is bumaba productivity rate agad.

**Other red flags**

* They discourage you to discuss salary and benefits with other employees under the guise of confidentiality, may disciplinary action pa daw yun. There is a chance siguro that new hires have higher salary than the tenured.
* Bawal mag Leave during December
* Wala daw proper orientation or endorsement to tasks. They expect you to know it all sa mga tools/platform na ipapagamit sayo. Kahit hindi ka nahire for that task. Bawal daw mag reklamo and just do it, kasi gipit deadline, dedication, effort. Kapag nag question ka naman, ikaw pa yung madidiin. 

&#x200B;

Kaya kayo jan, please avoid this company at all cost. Hindi worth it.

Kung sino pa yung mga Filipino CEO’s and Owners, sila pa yung ganito sa mga kababayan natin. Sobrang boomer(pwera da los buenos) toxic mentality.

1521,BPOs can be a better place if they reduce requirements to employees,"I was chatting to our foreign counterparts regarding this matter and I was shocked with how they operate. For context, they do the same job as us but the only difference is the time.

I found out that they log in to work, finish their assigned tasks, and go home. They do their occasional training and meeting, but that's it. For short, output lang talaga.

Sa Manila site, sobrang daming requirements na hinihingi as part of the ""KPI"": outputs, EOD reports, timesheets, performance, agility, productivity, commitment to team success, and personal and team growth. Gets ko yung mga output reqs pero why should I need to force to learn some random lesson then gagawan ko pa ng parang powerpoint presentation para ipakita sa mga teammates every month? Isn't that an individual obligation??

Just blowing off steam kasi there are a lot of times na I was supposed to be a candidate for a higher salary pero may points deduction ako kasi hindi ko tinuruan ng mga bagong skills yung kasama ko. I guess ganun ata pag exploitative company ayaw mag-hire ng external solution. Mag-hire ng empleyado para magwork at magturo, Oh diba tipid?

1450,Outsmart the Scammer,"To summarize the step how i outsmart the scammer on WhatsApp. 

1. I apply sa mga ads nila sa fb na kikita ng 3000-5000 a day or etc. 
2. May link sa ads nila after you apply sa ads nila na papuntang whatsapp. 
3. The person will explain niyo so many things pero ang buod ay after you sign in sa link nila may 40 or 50 ka nang makukuha. 
4. They will instruct you na mag recharge ng 100
Which is safe pa kasi ang ginagawa nila papaniwalain ka nila sa ibabalik nila yung 100+40+30 pesos ( thru grab order sa online shop link nila)
5. After mo mag reccharge, they will give a telegram link sa isang person na mag iinstruct sayo na mag grab order sa link nila after you recharge 100. 
6. After that they will instruct you to withdraw the 170 + ( it depend sa scammer hehe)
7. After a minute marereceive mo na yung 170.
8. Edi akala nila nakuha na nila trust mo mag ooffer pa sila na kapa nag recharge ka ng 500 madadadagan pa yun lalo pero wag mo na sila replyan haha iblock mo na hahah

So far i outsmart 7 scammer and nag hahanap pa ko ng ibang ads to outsmart them haha. Though 70 pesos lang maliit na pera pero payback na yun sa mga kasalanan nila haha kaya if ever na maka encounter kayo ng ganun outsmart them hahaha

In my short stay I observed madaming red flags. We are only 2 licensed inside the department (me as a newbie and another chief na 5 days straight absent since I’ve worked there. In short, ako lang mag-isa nakaduty), walang system, no orientation, no contract na naipakita sakin, and sinisigawan ang mga clients.

I’ve been giving it some thought if I should stay or just look for another job. I’m feeling overwhelmed and nakakapagod pala yung 6 days a week na work tapos ang baba pa ng pasahod. I’m not comfortable with my environment right now kasi nasisigawan and pinaparinggan ako ng nasa paligid ko. This might be because this is my first job and I'm feeling tired and nasa adjusting period ako? Am I being too sensitive sa first job ko?

* Owners are extremely unprofessional and degrade their employees by cursing at them.
* Job postings state that work hours are ""flexible"" but in reality, you'll be working almost 24/7 and adjusting to the CEO's schedule.
* The CEO threatens to shut down the company and threaten everyone's job security. There are screenshots out there. 
* No transparency on salary breakdown and government benefits. Not even sure if gov't contributions are being paid. 
* Owners are known to fat shame their own customers and make fun of the models they work with.
* People in upper management/senior roles are bullies. Work environment is similar to a high school clique and backstabbing is normalized.
* Someone tried to expose this company several months ago by reaching out to an influencer who then posted it on her Instagram story. Her story mysteriously got deleted though. Not sure what happened there LOL.

Companies just suck.,"Department of Labor and Employment has Department Orders that require companies to have policies and programs that protect employees from discrimination and assault to their dignity.  


Companies are required to have policies and programs regarding sexual harassment, drug use, HIV and illnesses, disabilities, and mental health conditions  


No discrimination shall be leveled against a person just because he/she has conditions most people deem not normal. A person can't be declined a position he/she is qualified for or be fired for having an illness- especially if and when it's a mental health condition.  


You can't just fire or not hire someone, just because you think a mental health condition poses a threat to the person and other people in the company. Hence, companies are required to have programs and support for mental health.

1215,"PICKUP Coffee faces complaints from 58 employees for withholding salaries, alleged unfair labor practices","A viral post from a former supervisor of PICKUP coffee sparked a complaint lodged by employees of the company who have yet to receive their salaries.

In her lengthy post, Angelica Batungbakal shared the unfair working conditions that employees had to deal with while working at the coffee company from short staffed branches, constant reshuffling, multi tasking and even having no breaks.

The complaint was picked up by Raffy Tulfo in Action where Batungbakal was joined by other employees who also had their fair share of complaints.

Batungbakal said that she was slapped with a 30 day suspension after HR asked her to return from Bulacan while she was on an authorized leave for her relative’s death anniversary.

Instead of accepting the sanction, she made the decision to resign; however, her final payment is still being withheld.

In her original Facebook post where she tagged Raffy Tulfo in Action, she said that 58 other employees had their salaries on hold for various reasons but they were too afraid to complain.

Another employee, Steven Fajaril, said that he actually did not know why he did not receive his salary last June 30. When he asked about this, he said the assistant area manager told him he was rude and he was suspended as a result. However, he said the only reason he raised his voice was because he felt wronged. He said this was the second time this happened to him and he is currently suspended from work.

Other complainants also said that their salaries were held for various reasons such as variance in inventory while another was suspended for being rude and for poor performance.

During the episode, Atty. Gerard Mariano, OIC director II of Department of Labor and Employment (DoLE) Makati and Pasay Field Office advised the 58 employees to file a complaint so that they may formally start the investigation into their allegations.

1149,Tinanong ang non-negotiables... para ma-negotiate,"I recently interviewed for a job where I was asked what my non-negotiables were. I told them that it was the option to work from home. The reason for this is because I have a remote/flexible working arrangement with my current employer that I now know I can't live without it. What can I say? I love a good work-life balance, especially having more time to sleep in, eat, be with my significant other, and for my hobbies. Of course I didn't expect to have a full-remote setup, but I thought at least I would have 2-3 days of working from home and the rest I can work onsite.

They should have just said it was a full RTO work arrangement and be done with it.

Instead, they asked me what is it with remote/flexible work arrangements that is non-negotiable for me. I explained that I didn't want to be stuck in traffic all the time and I know there are some tasks that I can do at home just as how I do in the office. They asked me where I lived, and when I told them it was around 20-30 minutes away from their office, they just said it's nearer than where others live. Which is not the point. The point is I don't want to be stuck in traffic, even for 20-30 minutes, period. They also asked me what tasks did I think I could do at home - like come on, this is a no-brainer. (P.S.: the job is involved in research, monitoring, basic desk job, etc).

Nonetheless, I answered all their questions.

So of course, they resorted to pointing to their assistants and basically said, ""*ito nga sila pumasok the whole week nung pandemic. Kapag may important activity, we all go beyond work hours dito. Ginagawa namin halos lahat, kahit wala sa job description namin, kasi 'yun talaga ang puso*.""

Which was a major red flag. Weird flex, but okay.

It was just so insulting how they asked me what my non-negotiables were and tried to negotiate me out of it. They could have just respectfully said that they could not accommodate my request, and I would be fine with it. There was absolutely no need to make an example of their clearly-underpaid-and-overworked assistants and themselves and make that the norm.

1643,Our company is starting to manage me out like what they did with their other employees who “resists” and I might lose my job,"I’ve been crying non stop since I got home. Tinawagan ako ng interim superior namin to tell me that anytime soon I might be put under PIP. The reason is they’re currently optimizing daw and compared my performance sa ibang countries, they said I’m under utilized. 

I don’t get it because I’ve been a performer since I started, I get yearly increase and bonus, on top of that I was awarded incentives given only to performing employees for 2 consecutive years. 

My hunch is that I had an application with another company few weeks ago and they conducted a background check (despite me stating not to conduct the check muna with my current employer), one of the managers received the email and next thing is nakaabot na sa pinakahead namin and sa superior ko. It was the time na I already withdrew the application and decided to stay with them.

1213,Former manager tracking me,"Sorry for the long post ahead 😅.

I've recently resigned with my previous company dahil grabe yung boss ko. Naninigaw ng bigla bigla. Pag may mali kang ginawa, para kang nasa school na bubulyawan ka with matching recitation pa for you to realize na may mali kang ginawa. Bukod pa dun, ipapamukha pa sayo na hindi mo alam ang ginagawa mo kahit alam mo naman. It's just that mahirap talaga this days. Kahit naman sya alam nya na mahirap pero ipapamukha nya sayo na ikaw ang may pagkukulang at hindi mo ginagawa ang trabaho mo.

Nung turn ko na, nabulyawan nya ko nga malupit sa harap ng mga kaofficemate ko with staff and officers telling us na makakakuha kami ng ""D"" sa rating namin for next year because we're incompetent. That time, I've been with the company for a couple of months pa lang and grabe yung trauma ko that time na nangyari yun. I answered all her questions while she's fuming with anger kasi hindi nangyari yung gusto nya. I gave her the numbers while my other colleagues were just silent and just keep saying ""ok po"". But not me. And i think this is one of the reason na after that incident, naramdaman ko ng pinag-iinitan nya na ko.

On that same month, I raise this to HR and told them I wanted to be transferred sa ibang unit and told her na hindi ko kaya yung ganung klase ng working environment.  I've also been a leader but I don't do that sa mga tao ko. Nakakahiya mang sabihin pero naiyak ako habang nagkukwento sa HR. Sabi nya sakin, maghahanap daw sya ng post na available. 

After that incident and my report with HR, walang nangyari. Sabi wala daw available na post so I decided to look for a new employer and goods naman kasi I am being interviewed na and just recently I started working na for this company.

Then during the exit interview, I told  HR about my experience. I told her na i reported this mula nung mangyari yung incident na yun but no feedback was given to me telling me na walang opening and other units preferred yung may experience na sa mga role na pwede ko sana applyan. Sadly, yung naginterview sakin for exit interview, sinabi nya sakin na walang nag-raise sa kanya na nagrerequest ako for transfer kasi sya pala ang may hawak ng internal transfer. I'm actually surprised and disappointed kasi akala ko tinutulungan ako nung naghire sakin, pero in reality hindi pala. 

Fast forward,  nalaman ng boss ko lahat ng sinabi ko kay HR sa exit interview. Now, galit na galit sa akin yung former manager ko and was asking kung saan daw ako nagtatrabaho.
They say not to burn bridges, but in this case I can't do that. Sya ang main cause bakit nagpapalpitate na ko everytime may naririnig akong sumisigaw. Bumaba din ang self-confidence ko after ng mga sinabi nya. 

To be honest, I don't have regrets however, napapaisip ako na once alam na nya kung saan ako nagwowork baka siraan nya ko kahit hindi totoo. 

I'm under probationary right now with my current work and nalaman ko lahat ng to dahil yung isang naging close friend ko sa loob, mineeting sila tungkol sa feedback ko sa kanya and ayun nga binabad-mouth ako ng former manager ko.",200,75,0.99,True,Advice Needed 🤔,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/15da7xp/former_manager_tracking_me/,2023-07-30 10:46:49,15da7xp

Yung international companies, they never ask me to write that much. Usually the situational questions are being asked sa call or video interview. Wala silang pake sa org chart ko sa previous company. Nakakatamad tuloy lalo magapply pag local (low salary, too much process).

1029,It was always about the friendships and favoritisms.,"**TLDR**

Some people at work really bring out the worst in you. Ako nalang palagi yung tinatama nang mga ""guards"" ng aming company. So we have ""guards"" assigned to supervise us making sure hindi kami nag open ng social media, umalis sa work station para mag chika-minute, at mag cellphone sa prod room. Parang supervisors. Di naman security guards pero  they have some similar tasks as a security guard. I'll just call them ""supervisor's assistants"". They are about 4 staff members. Gets ko naman kasi rules are rules. Napansin ko na kung sa iba or should I say ""their friends"" yung nag violate ng rules, eh wala lang.

Ngayon na bwesit talaga ako. Almost every day sa prod room, merong mag-uusap na hindi work-related at medyo malaki yung boses nila. Hindi naman sumigaw pero maririnig parin kahit malayo sila sa amin. Wala lang yung mga supervisors' assistants, hindi man lamang pinagsabihan. Don't get me wrong, okay lang naman mag-uusap sa mga seatmates kasi di yan mapipigilan pero sana hindi nakakadistract yung tunog ng boses nila. Bawal mag-uusap sa prod room pero di yan mapipigilan namin, so sometimes the ""guards"" let it slide lang as long as we talk softly. Sa pantry at lounge lang pwede mag-uusap at mag phone.

Fast forward sa break ko, naglalaro kami ng tropa ko ng Honkai: Star Rail kasi mag pu-pull ako kay Kafka (a waifu character from the game). Lumabas yung character  at na hype ako at yun nakasigaw ako pero hindi naman sobrang malakas, yung parang sigaw nga na excite ka lang, hindi yung sigaw na parang may sunog. At yun, binastos ako ng isa sa mga supervisors' assistants. The way nag warn niya sa akin ay very rude. Pwede naman magsabi ng ""Please lower down your voice"" or ""keep quiet"" kaysa yung ""Shush!!"" na malupit na tono. Ang bastos talaga!

Napansin ko nga na merong katrabaho din ako na sobrang bukangbibig at sobrang ingay kapag sumigaw kasi malaki yung boses niya (di ako nag exaggerate), pero hindi siya pinagsabihan ng mga ""guards"". Almost every day ko pa marining yun kasi sometimes magkapareho kami ng lunch break. Amazing how some ""authority figures"" act so rude and squammy. Hindi naman sa OA pero saying ""ssssst"" in a rude tone to subordinates is something I find disrespectful. Okay lang naman kung ka-tropa or kapatid mo yung pinagsabihan yan. 

Can't you guys talk to the employees in a polite manner? It's all about the favoritisms and friendships. This specific guard/supervisors' assistant speaks to me in a very rude manner. Don't get me wrong, wala akong kasalalanan sa kanya. I don't always break the rules. Never have I ever broken a very imporant rule na sobrang critical at grave offense na. Kaya I don't get why he is mean to me specifically. Another thing napansin ko is how my friend got suspended one time kasi nag wattpad lang siya pero yung iba nga nag phone at nag facebook sa prod room, yung friends nila, hindi nila pinagbigyan ng sanction. Welp.

To these supervisors' assistants who play favorites: Yes, we employees make mistakes. My point is I hope you could be FAIR to everybody. Don't treat your friends special even though they also broke one of the rules. Stop with the favoritisms. Also, please talk to your employees in a respectful manner as we also approach and respond to you guys in a polite manner.  I am not asking you to stop doing your job because that is indeed YOUR job. I just want you to stop treating me and some workers differently from your friends who are in the same position as me.

Friend 1 was a pioneer agent, and did not have to negotiate for her salary. 

A friend of hers even quit kasi iniinvalidate nun boss nya yun mental health issues nya caused by work. At dahil WFH, they're required to use their own device, maintain and fix it if broken and sagot din ng employees other costs like internet at electricity. However, as a practical girly, we are both aware na sakto yun package at 38k for both the salary and the upkeep as well as the opportunity to WFH and workload. 

Enter friend 2 na looking for work, with BPO experience amongst other jobs she's had. Since nasa malayo siya, we have referred friend 2 sa company ni friend 1. We also set her expectations on the tasks, the environment as well as the salary. Wala kami ineexpect or hinihintay na referral fee. This is all for friendship lang.

Imagine my shock when friend 2 was interviewed and she is offered 21-25k only and is expected to perform same job as friend 1. They both roughly had the same work experience. Napaka inhumane.

It's so unfortunate that the companies who brag about family at work, competitive salary and employee welfare would exploit workers the moment they get the chance. Expecting their employees to pay for the cost of business, but will pay them bare minimum salary and stress the hell out of them with heavy workload and uncaring leaders.

Sana sa mga people here looking for WFH, do not agree to this kind of set up. Times are tough pero if a company requires you to use your own device and pay for your own bills to do your work, 25k is a LOWBALL. You can argue na kasi WFH so naka tipid sa pamasahe, but if your device goes down due to heavy apps they use at work and if yun health mo ma compromise due to stress kulang pa yan sasahurin mo.

On my first company sa Alorica, I have a very hard working TL na exploited and generous with her overtime sa company. She got sick due to overworking and was comatosed and billed more than a million pesos. Let's just say Alorica barely paid 10 percent of that bill and she was back to overworking after getting healed.

1221,My employer rescinded my JO after telling me to resign from my previous job,"The title says it all.

Context: 
 I applied, passed several rounds of interviews, got hired, and was told to render my two weeks’ notice while waiting for my JO and contract to be sent. I did everything that was required, was diligent and updated HR through every single step, and made sure to get the proper notice from them. (Mind you, this is a good and respected company that I have been wanting to work for since I encountered them in a small project through the development sector. ) 

So imagine my surprise when out  of nowhere, I was told via email that my offer got rescinded on the week that I was scheduled for onboarding with them.  Focus daw muna sa ibang areas for the year, on  hold daw muna  yung supposed position ko. 

Eh bakit pa pala kayo nagpost ng vacancies? 
Bakit kayo nag-engage ng applicants? 
Bakit kayo nag proceed with application steps? 

Sobrang unprofessional ng ginawa nila and super uncalled for, considering na isa sila sa mga “elite”  (at well-funded) na orgs sa DevSec circle dito sa PH. 

Legally alam ko wala sila liability,  due to the absence of a JO and contract.  But the fact that you made an applicant go through so much trouble for a post that you’re suddenly deciding to put “on hold” AFTER instructing that person to resign is incredibly unprofessional.  

I was instructed to wait for the JO and contract. Pinag-resign ako. And now they left me  with an apologetic email full of vague corporate jargons reeking of plausible deniability. 

Dream job na sana, naging bato pa. 

TL/DR: ginago ako ng would-be employer ko at ngayon naghahanap ako ng trabaho, at tambak na ang mga babayaran

Ayoko magkalat online but I really just want to get this off my chest. So let this be a lesson to those who are considering leaving their current work dahil na-excite sa promise na trabaho ng “dream” company mo. 

Be very careful and vigilant, and don’t let your emotions and expectations of a ~good~ company cloud your judgement.

EDIT: 

Thank you so much for the advice, feedback and messages of support, guys! I really appreciate it. 🥺 Sobrang gago lang talaga na ganito yung ginawa sa akin ng org na to. I’ll consider this a lesson learned (the painful way hahahuhu) and a bullet dodged na rin siguro.

Sample: ang number 1 ""accomplishment"" ng company (and this is plastered on their pseudo online vision board) is how their kiss-ass of a manager fired and eradicated an entire department! we're talking about how she was instrumental in causing fellow filipinos a livelihood. and all because the owner wanted to cut costs. No joke this is is posted on their dashboard!

Not just with the employees, but also how they handle the sensitive information of their clients as in kahit sino pwede i-pull ung names, addresses, numbers, income, names of family members. Tapos they spam everyone with the promise of referral payments that never happen!

Hindi ka trip nun manager na tagapag-mana? Tsugi ka. Either i-backstab ka or passive aggressive talaga. Since madami ayaw mawalan ng work so many of the employees go along with it and they have to pretend they like her!

1545,Ayoko na galingan sa trabaho ko.," Nataon lang na kaya kong makipagsabayan sa Middle at Senior Management. Brief context lang, isa akong Supervisor sa kumpanya namin. Ngayon naman, napagtripan ng Senior Management na gawing automated ang operations namin at willing mag-invest ng millions of pesos para sa mga innovations. Ngayon, yung immediate superiors ko (Asst. Manager at Manager), dahil walang maasahan na gagawa ng kumplikadong trabaho gaya ng pakikipag-usap sa mga foreign suppliers at alamin yung technicalities ng mga makina - sa akin na lang binato. Sa akin naman, ayos lang, dahil isang project lang siya at kaya kong gamitan ng PM tools para align sa kanila yung plano na ginawa ko. Mga dalawang buwan din na paguusap sa negotiations at delivery sa amin. Ngayon naman, kahit wala sa JD ko ang project handling, at nakita ng Senior Management na kaya ko, nagdagdag sila ng apat pa na bagong project na dapat daw matapos ko sa taong 2023, tapos ako na raw bahala magdesisyon basta bigyan ko sila ng update. Ito yung mga pinagawa:

1. Manpower Calculator na para sa production department - Ewan ko pero may head naman sa department na ito at kaya namang gawin yung pag-allocate ng mga tao, pero putangina, sa akin pinagawa.
2. Process Optimization - Ito naman ulit, willing na naman gumastos ng millions of pesos para sa mga PDA devices na tingin ko hindi magagamit kasi sobrang stuck sa manual na proseso yung mga tao at hindi nila kayang mapabago yung sistema nila lalo't nakafocus lang sila sa profitability ng business.
3. BPI Audit - Bukod sa puro karne yung items namin, balak nilang magpasok ng plant product. Ngayon binigay na naman na project ay ipasa yung audit ng DA-BPI at mabigyan kami ng LTO.
4. System Changes (From SAP to WMS) - Maalala ko na dapat gagamitin ito dun sa 3PL ops namin, kaso itong Asst. Manager panggulo, gusto ipagamit yung system sa main operations ng kumpanya nang ora-orada. As usual, ako na naman gagawa ng plano kung ano ang dapat gawin.

Sa sahod? 20K lang, may OT pay pero madalang ako mag-OT. Bumoses na ako sa Director namin pero laging bukambibig na ""malaki tiwala sa akin"", ""may potential ako"" o ""skilled employee"".

* Upon hiring, you already have an active and ""almost all things"" covered HMO + one free dependent;
* said HMO, if unused for a year, can be used (Php 12k worth) to buy health and fitness-related equipment instead
* a life insurance paid solely by the company;
* monthly de minimis that doubles every year you stay in the company;
* canteen allowance that is replenished every cut-off;
* free shuttle that drives through the major towns near the company;
* free pre-employment medical;
* productivity pay/bonus every quarter (almost 30% of your monthly salary);
* bi-annual bonus that is usually x2 or greater of your monthly salary depending on the company's sales (ex. 15k/month x 2.5 = 37.5k)
* No Work from Dec. 22 - Jan. 4 due to the holidays: You still get paid in full for that entire cut-off
* Multiple company events: Christmas Party, Sportsfest, Wellness Day, Family Day, Summer Outing, Clinic Programs, etc.)

Sounds great, right?

I thought so too during my first 2-3 months. Until the downside presented itself in the form of the most toxic upper management I have ever experienced in my near-decade long career.

What do I mean?

* Manager has made guilt-tripping, threatening, physical sexual harassment, crude and tactless words a norm in the office, especially in her team. Uses company resources for her own benefit.
* Asst. Manager is a middle-aged pervert who basically did nothing at work, passing down his tasks to his subordinates, credit-grabs the sh\*t out of your work, catcalls women at work and makes r\*pe jokes on the daily.
* HRAdmin specialists and staff who lack empathy towards the people, is the first one to spread false information, backstabs and looks down on shopfloor operators, acts like a god and is inflexible to the needs of the people.
* Ancient-aged managers who refuse to evolve and improve the system, gossips and bullies verbally, entitled and dishonest;
* and many more.

I tried to give it a chance, I wanted to stay for the people. To help them get through the barrier of the shopfloor-office staff stereotype. But I just couldn't anymore.  


I lasted a record of 1 year and 3 months before I got scouted for a higher position in a different province. I felt sad leaving the others, but my mental health and sanity was hanging by a thin thread.

But it was such a difficult decision, because the benefits were amazing.

Looking back as I start in my new company, I sleep better at night now, my acid reflux from the stress and anxiety has calmed down, I'm losing weight slowly and am not craving too much of my comfort food like before.

1572,TALO NG MAY BACKER ANG MAY CREDENTIALS!,"Rant lang guys kasi nag apply ako sa isang Government Hospital, as Health care staff sa open na position as Health care staff 2. So ayun na nga sobrang tedious na nga ng process kasi may:

1.. May pa exam 
 2. May pa OJT for 5 days (Not paid!) And lastly,
 3. Panel interview (Hindi ka makaka pag panel interview kapag hindi ka nag OJT) 

Lahat yun tinapos ko kahit nag awol na ako sa current job ko kaso ang nangyari noong panel interview na 4 pala kaming candidfor position. 3 sa kanila sa loob na talaga it's either contractual and forda promotion. So medyo tanggap ko na na stacked against saakin kasi walk in lang ako. Pero noong panel interview na, sabay sabay kaming na interview and tinanong lang yung your name and career achievements. Shuta puro mema lang sagot nila like parang hello, Career achievements hinihingi hindi job description na ginagawa niyo!  Hindi naman sa pagbubuhat ng upuan pero, may achievements naman ako thru research and trainings. Kaya medyo nabuhayan ako ng loob hopefully mapilili. 

Pero ayun nga fast forward, nakibalita ako kung kamusta na,. So ayun ang napili is yung taga loob sa promotion which is kaya niya nakuha yung dating position kasi pinasok lang siya ng nanay niya. Kahit mediocre lang naman yung response niya sa interview and credentials and pang 2nd daw ako sa ranking, imagine kung wala yung may BACKER.

Kinausap naman niya ako, at tinanong kung meron na akong lilipatan, honestly wala. Kaya ako magreresign kasi hindi ko na kaya mentally yung trabaho at envi sa office.

1451,I'm sick of interviewers shortlising you for an interview without even looking at your resume first,"The captions says a lot. I'm tired of interviewers shortlisting you for an interview without actually looking at your resume first. 

I have been interviewed twice; one for a Tax accountant role and one for senior Accountant role.

For the tax accountant role, i don't have an experience yet, but i applied since i wanted to add this one to my professional skillset. Though they require at least 1 year of experience, i tried applying anyways since wala naman mawawala. I didn't hope to be shortlisted naman since i am inexperienced sa role na yun, pero i tried anyways.

Then they called me. Halfway through the interview, we stopped because i told them i don't have an experience as a tax accountant, but i would love to learn it as i'm a quick learner naman as long as may training kahit papano. They didn't even look at my resume. And we stopped the interview. I will be re-profiled daw.

Secondly, for a senior accountant role. There is no job description in linkedin so i applied since they are a healthcare company in the USA and may experience ako, but when they interviewed me, halfway ng interview, they said they require someone with an experience ""with this and that"" so we ended up ending the interview and i was told again that i will be reprofiled.

We would have avoided a lot of trouble on this one if they just bothered to check my resume first on whether or not i'm qualified for this position before calling me. Wala naman kasing job description sa Linkedin. I just relied sa nature of business na may experience ako.

Nowadays, a lot of interviewers are like that. They are not even looking at your resume first before plotting a schedule with you. Halatang binabasa lang nila the moment na kausap kana nila.

We would have saved a lot of time if they just look at the resume first prior to the interview.",119,21,1.0,True,Rant 😡,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/16385pb/im_sick_of_interviewers_shortlising_you_for_an/,2023-08-28 09:17:13,16385pb

1027,We have our department head. Pero mas lumalala pa yung trabaho namin. Lol,"I'm not saying wala sya alam at all but grabe yung gusto nya iimplement na mga out of this world and too good to be true. In my years of experience, it's the only time that I ever encounter this. Hahaha

So we are a startup and everything seems to be fine when she was hired as our dept head (director pa nga yung title), we are happy at first kasi addition to the team and learning sana knowing her position and direct reporting most of us sa kanya, but man, she doing decisions that really made our operations fucked up. Here are some of the scenarios that we experienced handling and perhaps salvaging cause of here:

1. She reduced our costing of about 70% as promo daw and implement it ng walang case study and presentation sa board. Pero ang calculation nya is 40% lang daw yung discount according to her. The problem is she asked to send it via edm with our names at it and we have current clients with current project na nakita yon, so we were asked by the client bakit di namin inoffer yung promo. This one was called out by my colleague and her reason is ""testing the waters.""

2. She fucked up a big client when she set up a face-to-face meeting of her own and didn't show up. And she only sent us an email (informing that she set a meeting) about 5 mins before her call time na baka raw pwede icover. Right after I saw it, luckily I was around the area lang, I called agad sila client so I can cover (I was about 15mins late pa tuloy). I call her out for that and her response is, buti na nga lang andun daw ako sa malapit and alam nya na kaya ko ihandle yung client...

3. She sent a memo with a subject of termination sa isang project manager ko, without informing the HR. All for the reason that my PM didn't responded to her slack chat for 2 hours (my pm is in the meeting) and being missing in action daw for 3 days, the dude got into motorcycle accident nung time na yun and filed an emergency leave. What's weird is that naka cc kami and our ceo sa email, pero hindi HR. Hahaha

4. To improve the process, I/we used to do trackers, report summary and some formulated google sheets. And we found out that over the mancomm, she said she initiated those to optimize our process. But when she was asked to add some data, she immediately message us sa slack to attend mancomm and do the formula.

5. Not sure if true. But sabi ng ibang colleagues ko, she's earning around 180k gross. I really didn't want to enter someone else's deal/salary. Tho I believe na she on 6 digit naman knowing her position. 

6. Earlier, got the office very early and she's here na rin kasi she's going to present sa mancomm. She told me (mej namemressure effect) that our cashflow is low and I need to find clients to fill operational costs and have a revolving funds. She pinpointed that I only got 2 projects (worth 3.2m each and kasi ako natatapos ko on time yung project) while others has more. So I told her thay cashflow is not part of my task and I already put up 8 digit worth of projects this year (my target is only 8M).

6. I think this one was the worst. We are presenting sa client (face-to-face) and all I thought sya magrereport but likewise she will say na kami magreport and sya will obesrve us on our performance like we are in a singing contest. While my colleague is reporting, I noticed she's just checking her laptop and not paying attension. Then suddenly, biglang tumunog laptop nya with that ting-ting-tang-tang song and it is so loud... Then siguro nataranta, she try to click close pero nag move to another song and then another and another... One of the client politely went to here and close her laptop. Her defense, she was just replying to an urgent email and nagloko yung laptop nya, medyo sira na raw kasi (for context, kakabili lang sa kanya nung macpro)...

These are just majors, may mga minor shits pa sya. Planning to raise this to our HR and CEO. While she's an addition kasi, she's an added liability kasi. 4 from our team already resigned kasi sya yung reason and some told me that they are planning na to leave. 

As said, it's very too good to be true story but this is really what's happening. Over the past work experience ko sa lahat ng boss ko, sa kanya lang ako di natututo.

More than half a decade on this profession (won't disclose, but will give a clue - anti dox measure), walang salary increase, contractual, walang benefits, ""no work, no pay"".

Maganda performance mo? Mamanmanan ka lalo ""para hindi daw maligaw ng landas"". No rewards on good performance, tapos puro ""OThankYou"" - sige, expected na kasama sa propesyon na ito, na maski sa bahay, nagtatrabaho ka pa rin. Tanggap ko yun. Naka-off ako, need umattend ng meeting, tapos dahil off mo, wala kang sasahurin kahit umattend ka. Hindi ka umattend sa outside work activities, le-label-an ka as walang pakikisama, mukhang pera. Umusbong anxiety ko sa mga yan, like, halos lahat ng gawin mo, may masasabi at may masasabi. Lahat, panghihimasukan. Ipaglaban mo karapatan mo, turing sayo, subersibo - iinit ang mata sayo. Subpar, unconducive facilities for work: ""Gawaan mo ng paraan."" Tapang pa ng management na magmalaki na may papalit sa amin kapag nagresign kami, at magpasalamat na lang daw kami kasi may trabaho kami.

May mga aktibidades na labas sa sinumpaang trabaho mo pero within organization like consultancy, pero walang honorarium, dahil may nagreklamo sa honorarium na kung tutuusin ay napakaliit na nga - sub-500, if you'll ask. Laging pabor sa mga kliyente ang management - reklamo ng kliyente, papakinggan, gagawaan ng paraan. Pero sa management, bilang empleyado ka nila, wala kang karapatan sa sukli ng pinaghirapan mo. Late sahod kapag natapat ng weekend or Monday, since hindi sila nagpapasahod ng Monday for some reason.

Pagod na ako. Though masaya ako sa ginagawa ko, galit ako sa ginagawa ng management at sa sistema.

EDIT: For the context, sahod is averaging on 16K a month. Worst is 10K kapag puro holiday. Best is 19K, pero tambak at halos nasakripisyo na health ko. Varying salary were due to ""no work, no pay"", and whatever additional pay you get, sa meds lang napupunta in return dala ng sakit na lalala due to additional workload rin.

1131,"Today was a good day, I'm proud of myself as a hiring manager","I've been a sales director for 8 years. I started working for my company when I was 26.

Two months ago, I have been taken out of my sales job and have been promoted to Director of Hiring and Culture.

Mind you, I work for a geopolitical consultancy firm that sells market research and sponsored content. One of the my marching orders as the head of culture and people training is to find talent.I don't have a background in HR, I don't even have a background in management, but, heck, I'll make it work.

And ang sabi ko ""okay, I'll come up with a plan, but on one condition: give me free reign as to how I would find, train and retain talent"" and they said yes.

Now, I'm a rebel by definition. I was a misfit in high school. I failed Ateneo, I failed UP, I passed DLSU (but was not able to enroll coz I had to take summer classes). I even failed UST. The only reason I was able to study in UST for one year was that my dad was close to our village Parish Priest. And the Parish Priest said ""we lack seminarians. You wanna give UST a go? yun nga lang seminarista ka"" and I said ""fuck it let's go."" My parents sent me to new york to complete my undergrad studies, eventually, but it was a circuitous route.

And you know, I'd hate for other people to undergo the same bullshit na pinagdaanan ko sa hiring and training and all that. I hate the feeling of people making you feel like you're outside looking in.

So I decided, I'm not going to go through the traditional LinkedIn, JobStreet, Head Hunter avenues.

I'm gonna find talent on Reddit.

And I said, I'm not going to require our applicants na they should be a college graduate, at least 5'4, 21-25 yrs old with pleasing personality.

Let's make this even a bit more exciting. I want to open the application process (and encourage) PWD's, out of school youth, formerly incarcerated people, retirees, and other people who may not fit the traditional mold of a corporate organizational man.

But wait, there's more.  I'm not going to require people to have an NBI clearance, Transcript of records, Certificate of employment, and other red tape nonsense.

Plus, it's bullshit to require people to come to the office. Even tho have my office in Rockwell, I dont go there. Kung hindi ako pumupunta dun, bakit ko papupuntahin mga tao dun?

Stretching that logic, why should I hire only from Manila? Why not from the far flung regions? It's WFH anyway.

Across all data points and criteria, Potato Corner would have a stricter hiring policy than my policy, even though one requires that person to serve french fries, and this other job allows you to attend zoom meetings with CEO who talk about about the implications of the Taiwan-China rift in supply chain.

There was only a couple of  conditions, in my view. That person has to have good work ethic,  be able to speak forgivable English and be passionate about geopolitics. Like, that's it.  Full stop.

The first job I posted was, I'm looking for someone who can copy paste and set appointments. That's It. No other responsibilities than those 2 things. And hinulaan ko lang yung sahod, sabi ko sa boss ko, mmmmm... I think okay na yung 18k / month NET. Work from home naman eh, no time tracker.

I got 167 applications. Got 2 positions, one guy who lives in Baguio and a University of the Cordilleras Graduate who initially wanted to work for us for free in return for sales mentorship and how to do strategic planning, but I said, what if I can give you both and a salary? lol

And another guy who lives in Davao, UP Graduate impeccable English, software Dev but couldn't find a job due to some disability. 

These two guys of super high caliber I otherwise would not have found if I followed the Philippine corporate HR non-sense.

Today was a good day, and I'm proud of myself.

And I'm not content. I don't know this, I dont know a lot about HR and people development. I'm just a Philosophy graduate. I wanna learn more.

Last Friday, I closed a $39,000 deal, and my boss closed another $78,000 deal. That should give the firm a little bit more breathing space to grow and hire more talent in the short to medium term..

Once we bounce back from the pandemic, we're going to go back to hiring entry level roles that start at 60K / month net and 100k month /net after their 6 month probation.

Alam niyo, naniniwala ako sa kasabihan na to. Kasi pakiramdam ko naramdaman ko na din to. Here’s my story…

Naemploy ako kay Employer Z last May 2022. Ok naman workmates and boss, very welcoming. Pero nung dumating ang pagkakataon na mas makilala ko ang boss ko, ayun na, nagpakilala talaga.

Sabi ko, ay baka ganito lang talaga siya, hindi hands on, tapos pag pressured time na, ppresurein ka pa lalo, hahanapan ka ng work na parang hindi ka overload ng work, tapos pag badtrip siya, makikita mo talaga sa fez niya, ikaw nalang din mabbadtrip, tapos pag off mo, tatawagan ka (may urgent kasi eh), kulang nalang sabihin pumasok ka dito, dapat nandito ka sa opisina, at mahilig magpahiya. Well yun yung impression ng way ng mga comments niya sakin. Yung tipong, kung makapag comment eh akala mo hindi mo talaga pinag isipan yung bagay na yun kaya wala ka, wala talaga matter. Typical boss, not leader ganun kind of thing.

Ganun ba talaga pag pressured times? Pwede maging ganito ang boss? Pano niyo hinandle?

So nagpasa na ako ng resignation ko nung July 2023. Pikit mata kahit walang lilipatan, konti savings at emergency fund.

Ngayon, walang wala akong gana magtrabaho. Nung nagpasa ako ng resignation ko, ang daming ganaps, may isang coworker ako need magresign, meron mga projects and clients si company na hinahandle na in short, hindi kakayanin na mawalan ng tao ngayon.

Take care of your employees, they will take care of your business. 

Kaya ako nagresign kasi gusto ko lumayo sa katoxican. Toxic man sakin yung mga situations na ganito, eh iba iba ang tao, hindi parepareho. Gaslighting no.1 niya yan.

Kung ayaw niyo mawalan ng tao, you shouldve treated your employee well. Hindi lahat ng pagkakataon iintindihin kayo ng employee niyo na GANYAN TALAGA YAN SI BOSS, IKAW NALANG UMINTINDI.

This is my first job, and habang tumatagal at dumadami trainings, lalo ki na rerealize na parang di ko kaya ‘mahalin’ / ‘magustugan’ yung work. No clear JD din kasi from the start. Umasa lang ako since yung Inapplyan ko na Job Post sa jobstreet is what I originally wanted. I got shortlisted. Then, pinag apply nila ako sa workday na Job Post to process my recruitment, but different from what I applied to, and nag ask ako, sabi lang is generic title lang daw nila yun for freshers. So umasa ako na yung scope of work ko is yung original job post sa jobstreet. Now, I am deployed to my team. They are all nice and helpful naman. I got no issues kahit sa pay, benefits, unli training materials, flexible setup, as in. Yun nga lang, ang role ko is more on “support” na.

Title: ASE (Associate Sofware Engineer) - expects to code

Decided na talaga ako mag resign. However, what’s stopping me is alam kong struggle mag hanap ng work. Kaya I am applying na rin sa roles while I’m here. Here’s my plan: 

1. I am not planning to disclose this “working experience” since others have mentioned that it would do more harm than good. Tagged as Job Hopper kung baga.

2. I plan to resign once may JO na ako. However, I might not be able to start immediately because of the render period. I am okay naman with rendering, but ano kaya pwede idahilan sa lilipatan ko why I cant start agad? (We don’t have a bond, but 60 days ang render period)

1038,Problematic governance?,"I work at a diagnostic clinic in the records department. On top of the work being toxic and our department in particular being understaffed, I can already feel that our job as records personnel is severely under-appreciated. Since our clinic mostly screens people for migration, not only do we have to be meticulous in handling and updating medical records while maintaining utmost confidentiality, we also have to deal with some legal stuff. Apart from that, we facilitate the process of medical examinations from start to finish so we basically keep things running like clockwork.

Our services are pretty much client-based, and people who took their medical there can leave their reviews. Today, we received one bad review directed at our department in particular. The complaint wasn't even about their own experience but of another person they were with when they took the medical, and it's the usual kind we get because the wait can honestly be long if they passed certain documents that we send for approval to our higher-ups. So imagine our distress when we suddenly hear they'd be issuing us a corrective action request.

Something like that can not only affect our salary but our reputation as a department and as individual employees as well. The worst thing about it is the overall head of our clinic didn't even defend us. He *did* ask not to proceed with the CAR *for now*, but then he had to say that if another complaint about our department arises that's when they can issue one. Like, what the f\*ck. And we can't even defend ourselves, because we can only do so if a CAR has already been issued against us, so we'd already have an offense by then.

They distributed a memo regarding this CAR thing and they even tagged it with ""for strict compliance"". I mean, is this normal? This is my first job, after all, so I'm not sure if this is a thing in companies or if they should have held a meeting with us about it first.

So far, I'm not happy with the autocratic management here. There seems to be a lot of issues among my co-workers as well and there are only a few I get along with.

Holiday sa AU na di pre-selected? Wala kang double pay 😬

IT FEELS LIKE YOU'RE WALKING ON EGGSHELLS.
No room for improvement. Isa'ng mali pag mumukhain kang napaka tanga, pag iinitan, ima-micromanage tapos biglang tatanggalin.

1530,Coworker sabotaged my report,"Back when I was a new hire in an electric coop, I shared a laptop with a workmate four years senior to me. Tawagin na lng natin sa pangalang ""Bruhiyawa"". We did a lot of work as team mates.

One day, habang field works si Bruhiyawa, tinawag ako ng supervisor namin. Tinanong niya kung sino ang gumawa ng report namin, dahil marami daw mali. Tapos tinuro niya ang parts na ginawa ni Bruhiyawa. Hindi ko gusto ilaglag si Bruhiyawa, pero my boss is asking me to answer honestly. Yun. Sinabi ko lang ang totoo, nothing more, nothing less. My supervisor patiently taught me how to correct the wrong parts, all the while, nagrarant how disappointed siya kay Bruhiyawa na pinapasok ng manager namin. That day, he was hurriedly turning over the reporting to me at nag field works without my supervisor's approval.

The next day, the same file was swamped with #REF at wrong cell references. Tapos pinaparinggan niya ako na sipsip at pabibo. Pinapakalat pa niya na sinisiraan ko daw siya. Ang hindi niya alam, I have multiple file backups. After that, I strived to learn VBA macros and locked everyone out sa files ko. I also automated a compliance report and shortened the lead time from three weeks to three days.

Years passed. Got promoted twice. He's still stuck six ranks below me. God is good. Vengeance is mine says the Lord. Be patient. Be humble He will exalt you in due time.


Edit: Nasaan daw ang ""AntiworkPH"" dito? My manager is still siding with this brutish workmate even now. Malakas talaga na sipsip si Bruhiyawa. Makaasta sa opisina akala mo kung sinong magaling. Akala mo kung sinong boss. He even tried to steal my credit once sa special project ko but he was ashamed when someone tried to ask him, but I answered in detail instead.

Kaya pala 300+ years tayo sakop ng Espanya dahil ang karamihan sa atin ay mga mangmang at uto-uto. Kung hindi nagreklamo mga ancestors natin noon, hindi tayo magiging malaya. Kung hindi nag reklamo ang mga empleyado noong 1910s, edi 14+ hours parin ang standard work hours ngayon imbes na 8 hours. Wala tayong weekends, wala tayong sick leaves at vacation leaves kung walang nag reklamo dati.

Tapos ang dami pang kontra labor unions dito. Jusko naman, tatanga nyo. Bakit, business owner ba kayo? Kayong mga HR at Managers, biktima rin kayo ng systema. At isa pa, kayong mga enabler ng hustle-grind culture, di kayo kailangan dito sa sub.

1000,Lagi na lang akong hinahawakan ng TL ko sa office,"Hi. First time posting here. I am 23M and works in an IT company. As the title say, my TL(gay) always touching me. Sorry if baka medyo magulo ako mag kwento. Yung TL ko kasi ay lagi na lang akong hinahawakan everyday tuwing lumalapit sa akin. He's always touching my legs, chest, tummy, and arm. Everytime na lalapit siya, lagi nya na lang hinahawak hawakan yung mga braso ko or lalamasin yung dibdib ko(minsan both hands sa chest ko yung hands niya) or pinipisil pisil yung belly fat ko sa tagiliran or harap. Tapos yung legs ko rin hinahawakan para pisilin. 

Tiniis ko to for months and I'm really sorry if may madisappoint man ako rito kung bakit una pa lang, hindi ko na nagawang pumalag. Sorry naging coward man ako. Natakot kasi ako. Pero nag decide na akong isumbong na talaga para matapos na to dahil pati nipple ko ay ginagawa na nyang joke. Hinahawakan niya ako para laruin yung nipple ko in a sexual way(idk kung para sa kanya joke lang to) pero sobrang uncomfortable na talaga yung level. Kahit ilang beses ako mag flinch, inuulit ulit niya pa rin gawin. Naopen up ko to sa ka team ko at ang pinayo niya sa akin, alisin ko raw ang kamay niya kasi ginaganon din siya dati. Ayun, ginawa ko edi inaalis alis ko kamay niya pero tingin ko he will not stop. 

Gusto ko syang isumbong sa manager rather than hr kasi close siya sa hr at mas may tiwala ako sa manager namin at takot siya ron. Actually, hindi lang naman ako yung ginaganito niya pero by observing, ako talaga yung pinaka worst na lagi nyang hinahawakan bigla. Gusto kong mag sumbong anonymously sa mga ginagawa nya. Ayoko ng apology niya. Ang gusto ko lang, itigil niya yung ganitong gawain sa officemates nya. I'm planning to resign here pero ayoko na aalis na lang ako na ganito lang na walang laban. Also para wala na ring ibang mabiktima yung TL ko in the future officemates.

So ayon, sabay-sabay kaming nadeploy tatlo sa store, kala namin magkakaroon na kami ng magandang trabaho, kalbaryo pala. Yung dalawang babae nadeploy sa counter tapos ako naman sa soda (mga drinks and ice cream ganyan, andon din ako sa counter nag-aassemble ng mga drinks at sundae ganon).

Lagi silang pinagtatawanan tapos pinag-uusapan ng mga dati ng crew don pag nagkakamali sila pero di naman sila nagtuturo nang tama at kumpleto. Nagkamali sila non sa mga call ng orders para maluto ng kitchen tapos pagtatawanan pa at pag-uusapan na kala mo elementary. Same din pag namamali ng pindot sa counter. 

Basta sa lahat ng pagkakamali nila pagchichismisan sila at pagtatawanan eh di naman nila tinuturo yon.

* May buddy system sila ng another 1 month, pero yung ka-buddy nya hindi nman nagtuturo or walang chance magturo kasi daw ""hinihiram"" sya ng ibat-ibang senior sa group nila para tumulong magbuhat at kung ano-ano pang task na supposedly hindi dapat sya ang tumutulong.
* In short, dalawang buwan nasayang sa kanya dahil wala sya natutunang for 2 months na pwede nya i-apply sa actual. Sabi pa nya ang laki daw ng pinagkaiba policy-wise ng St. Luke's sa Hopital na pinagtrabahuhan nya sa middle east. Ang dami daw na unnecessary steps. And to add, hindi to about skills, about lang to king pano gagawin yung trabaho nila based sa practice ng hospital.
* So after 2 months training binigyan na sya ng patient na ihahandle nya ng solo. first day ng yung dapat na 8 hours duty, naging 14 hours sa dami ng dapat gawin at wala man lang seniors ang umalalay or willing umalalay sa kanya.
* sa 14 hours na yun, wala syang naiinom na tubig or makakin ng kahit ano. One time nag-lunch sya, hinanap at pinagalitan daw sya ng Manager nila kasi daw 8 hours lanbg ang duty walang lunch break. (literal kasi na 8 hours ang duty nila like 8-4PM, hindi gaya ng usual na pag 8 hours duty usually 8-5, 9 hours tlga kasi may 1 hour break sa kanila straight talaga).
* Minsan umabot na ng 12 hours na wala syang kain at inom, nagpaalam lang syang uminom, pero after 2 mins hinahanap na agad sya ng manager.
* in 2 weeks of working sa ganitong environment nakapag adapt nman daw sya, yung dating 14 hours umaabot na lang ng 10 hours in her 2nd week. pero OTTY sya kasi sabi ng manager nya, hindi daw acceptable na reason for OT since INEFFICIENCY LANG DAW TO SA PART NYA""
* Last shift nya, nag break down yung kababata ko habang kumakain ng ""dinner"" 2AM sa mcdo. Umiiyak sya kasi kahit grab wala syang mabook. And mind you this is a mother of 8 months old baby. Natural mamimiss nya anak nya. Sobrang naself-pity sya buti na lang yung asawa gising pa at naghihintay sa kanya at sinundo sya agad.
* Nagdesisyon yung asawa nya na hindi na sya papasok kinabukasan dahil kaya nya daw na sya lang magtrabaho. Kinabukasan nagresign sya. And may pinapiramahn sa kanyan na letter na ""alam nya daw na hindi acceptable ang immediate resignation at dahil hindi sya nagrender ng 30 days ay forfeited na last pay nya at ang COE na ibibigay sa kanya nakanote yung fact na yun.

I told them mag file sa DOLE kasi valid na reason for immediate resignation nya as ""inhumane na yung treatment sa kanila sa work"". Tama ba?

1161,Akala ko malaki sweldo ko. Hindi pala.,"Hello sa inyo. Almost 1 month pa lang ako gumagamit ng reddit and I learned A LOT. Especially sa workplace..sa swelduhan to be exact.

I’m a 27-year-old-guy working in ACN as an SSE. 6 years na ako dito and first job ko rin after college. I started as a Manual Tester and eventually naging Automation Tester. Maganda experience ko so far pero ayun nga overworked rin talaga + OTYs. Naghahandle rin ako ng mga juniors and conducting KTs/bootcamps.

As an SSE, 42K yung basic salary ko. 42K. Nitong nakaraan lang, madami kaming newbies. Syempre kwentuhan hanggang napunta sa sweldo ang topic. Meron kaming newbie na CL11 tapos 45K basic niya. Newbie, CL11 at 45K. 

Then may CL10 na newbie (ako CL10 din) SSE. 76K yung offer sa kanya. Nong narinig ko yun..pucha nanghina ako sa loob ng restaurant na kinakainan namin. Wala akong alam sa sweldo prior to that kasi focused ako sa trabaho lang and other engagements on top of the usual work. 

Mas mataas pa sweldo sakin ng CL11 and yung CL10, halos doble ng akin. Sumama talaga pakiramdam ko mga pres. Tapos the fact na walang increase this year.

Simula non, nawalan ako ng gana sa work. Doon ko narealized na kaya pala madaming kasabayan ko ang umalis na at naka 3 or more companies na. Siguro malalaki na sweldo nila.

Naiiyak ako while typing yhis kasi I dedicated my life sa projects na hawak ko, madami rin akong extracurricular activities, kudos from management and client, tapos ganito? Wow.

Nawawalan na talaga ako ng gana. Line up pa raw ako sa TL promotion next year. So magkano, 50K?! 😞 akala ko malaki na sweldo ko kasi I didn’t bother to look elsewhere or even search sa internet. Nakakapanghinayang. Gusto ko nang umalis hahaha.",233,78,0.98,True,Story 🗣️,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/17endra/akala_ko_malaki_sweldo_ko_hindi_pala/,2023-10-23 23:39:40,17endra

I have been working for 7 years and lahat ng naging trabaho ko, bigay na bigay, sulit na sulit sa 8 hours and I am not even earning 30k per month until now.

We’ve been doing our best to have our voices heard and we finally took a leap and exposed **Jemina Ty, Blackbough Swim’s CEO, and their very toxic environment**.  

Our Tiktok went viral in just 2 days. Even influencers started liking and reposting our videos. But of course, the devil works harder. And with money and PR agency involved, of course, our account got permanently banned.  

So here we are, trying our best to tell our stories again, hoping that it would reach as much people as it can so everyone can be informed by how toxic, fake, and ugly Blackbough Swim really is.  I hope y’all can share this on you wall, groups, other platforms, or wherever you think could help spread the news.   

It’s disgusting to know how evil Jemina Ty is and yet she’s being featured in a lot of big medias. 🤢

IT’S TIME TO SHOW EVERYONE WHO YOU REALLY ARE. 🐴 

Sharing y’all the screenshots of ex employees’ testimonies. You can also **Google search “Blackbough Reddit” or Tiktok search “Blackbough issue”**.   

**P.S. There are already existing cases in DOLE and BIR against Jemina Ty and Blackbough Swim, but we are being ignored. So this is our last resort.**

Reason: 9 interview level. Yes. NINE INTERVIEWS with HR Assistant/HR Manager/Manufacturing Manager/Manufacturing Assistant Director/Manufacturing Director/VP for Manufacturing/SVP for Manufacturing/EVP for Manufacturing/CEO. 
Scenario: Though may benefits at may ""work-life balance"" at less politics na nabanggit yung HR Manager sakin, isa sa core values nila ay ang pagiging ""family-oriented"" which is SUS knowing na red-flag ang ganito sa corpo world. Mabait daw yung owner pero upon interview na dun sa Manufacturing Assistant Director, na masasabi kong condescending type of person, tipong di pa ako natatapos sumagot sa question eh may additional feedback agad. Ang sabi pa di daw ako makakapasa if ever maendorse na ako sa SVP pero good riddance. Nainis na rin ako that time since yung mga tanong paulit-ulit. Hanggang ngayon nagtataka ako bakit ang daming Interview pero Supervisor position lang naman siya?

Company 2: Asia*** (Coop). Position Applied: MT. 

Reason: Yung linya pa lang nung hiring Manager na ""I don't think so"" sa sagot ko na ""I can adapt to any work condition since I worked with various industries"" eh napataas ako ng kilay. Since nagpapakita ng superiority complex dahil lang may position at 'hiring manager' diniretso ko. Reply ko na lang dun sa kasama niya na nakamute sa zoom ""Ms. Andrea(not real name) here is somewhat looking for an adjective that will suffice her question regarding what sets me apart from other candidates when in fact I already told her that I can adapt in any work setting. With that, I am not interested for this job opportunity anymore since sabi niyo maghahawak ng hundreds of personnel with only 20K of actual salary. Goodbye and thank you.""

1010,another va agency to avoid. DO NOT WORK HERE.,"TL;DR

va agency (Virtual Connection Hub) who likes to lowball and has many monitoring shenanigans such as being on cam and on gmeet the whole shift, hubstaff screenshot monitoring, sending eod and sod report every shift and so on. they also like to gaslight their clients that the lowball rate is more than enough. 

---
---

i had the worst experience ever sa agency na ito.

&#x200B;

nag apply ako kasi nakalagay sa post na $7 per hour so ako naman, willing na willing. then nalaman ko nalang right after passing the interview that the offer was only for $3 per hour. no contract, handbook or anything that would give us an idea about the company's policies or whatnot. now, it was my fault kasi pinatulan ko pa rin but I badly needed work that time.. wala pang tumatanggap sakin na ibang client. and it was only part time so I figured pang side hustle nalang.

&#x200B;

then came our training.. our responsibilities extended beyond generating leads to tasks such as manual property search (individual to ha lol), cold calling, follow-ups, graphic design, web graphic design, data entry, CRM management, closing deals and more. we basically are going to run the business by ourselves na. go lang pero as we became more involved in the job, we realized that the workload did not correspond fairly to our pay.

&#x200B;

it just happens that while we were on a meeting, my colleague was sharing her screen then dahil pinag-uusapan namin na if we're worthy of a raise na (iba talaga nagagawa ng kahirapan), we would ask for a raise. she had a note on her screen for this and the client happens to read it. so he offered an increase. we also shared na it was not the rate we were expecting and blah blah.

&#x200B;

so goods na sana.. however, the CEO/owner of the company intervened, claiming that we were violating company policies despite the absence of a signed contract or proper onboarding. they even threatened termination under what policy? common sense? lol. our client had to arrange a meeting to resolve the issue. tapos tong mga gagong to dito pa nagpa sign ng NDA kashittan bwakanang shit talaga. they also sent my colleague an email (photos below) threatening us to be terminated. UNDER WHAT POLICY NGA NA WALA NAMAN KAYONG SINABI, NI ORIENTATION WALA. TF.

&#x200B;

kaso sa next meeting naman with client, his stance massively shifted, and we were once again offered a lower rate, with the justification that it was sufficient. that he was paying so much already. he was implying that the rate we're getting is so much already, that it can feed a family of three or four, not the exact words but that's what he meant. he baited us with commission nalang, kesyo anlaki daw ng makukuha namin if we just work and focus on closing deals. we won't mind our  hourly rate na daw to the point we won't even like working full-time (kasi we were asking din just to increase our pay kasi walang wala talaga that time).

&#x200B;

'to namang tanga kong kaworkmate, oo ng oo. naconvince. this client is a real estate investor and I know there's money in real estate pero it will take time. with the promise that he was giving us, it's false. di ganun yun kadali. having my workmate's inexperience, umoo siya without me.

&#x200B;

so ang nangyari, dahil hirap siya makahanap ng client kasi inexperienced nga, naimpound motor niya. her internet was disconnected because the rate honestly can't pay the bills. she needed to pay her rent and had kids to feed so idk how she did it but ganun na nga.

&#x200B;

tas nalaman ko nalang na kaya naman pala nag-aalangan si client mag give ng increase kasi may additional din si agency. sobrang gago no? and he said he's already paying $20 each on top of our rate.

&#x200B;

\- continuous supervision during work hours, including having the camera on all the time (except during breaks or meetings with client pero kahit na ganun imemessage ka pa rin ng manager kuno na mag on cam parang gago lang talaga). this was also not initially communicated and only disclosed after onboarding. may hubstaff din na installed on your PC, taking a screenshot every five minutes. you also have to manually put in your time in and out, along with your hours sa google sheet. and, SOD and EOD reports every shift. AND, struggles, success reports every friday. lol.

\- pay is consistently late, in fairness sa consistent. kasi daw si owner/CEO is occupied with other matters, THE HELL. The client pays a week in advance of the payday. anong pake ko sa mga gawain mo nyeta.

\- the senior manager tends to be disruptive and lacks professionalism during client meetings. may pagka chismosa din and sorry for the lack of term, bobita. sorry ha pero pag nagsasalita siya sumasakit ulo namin kasi bulol bulol siya mag english. to inatrasan ko kasi mas marunong pa sa client!! kala mo naman pinapasahod ang laki laki. may nararamdaman na ata to sa utak dahil sa dami niyang roles sa agency hahaha lol. mahilig din to mangbara, backstab tsaka mamaliktad.

\- there are only two people working as admins – the owner/CEO and the senior manager) plays multiple roles, including trainer and payroll staff, which seems cost-cutting. cheap. so alam na ha if ganito na agency except if pioneering. mga gahaman nyeta.

\- namimilit ng boto para manalo sa award nila. pag di ka bumoto, may consequence. araw-araw minomonitor ni ceo/owner. dapat araw-araw ka nagsesend ng email na confirming nagvote ka with screenshot proof. then magpopost sa FB saying na thankful daw sa clients. lul gago. delusional ang pota.

&#x200B;

and oh, virtual connection/virtual connection hub is the agency. dalawa companies nila, yung isa is real estate data. sun something group. so stay safe peeps. you are what you tolerate.

1659,Prioritize getting a high salary - health related emergencies will kill your savings,"My partner stayed for 4.5 days in a regularly-priced provincial hospital. She had an infection in her leg that ended up requiring her to undergo surgery. So adding up surgery fees, hospital fees and doctor's fees - the total was around \~279k gross.

There were thankfully some discounts! HMO, PWD and Philhealth reduced the bill by \~50%.

But still - that's \~120k+ net. And we got the bill prepared at 8pm that evening. The hospital only took cash for the doctor's fees (which was 70+k of the remaining net). I can't imagine how I'm gonna pay for that if I didn't have money saved up.

This recent experience validated my choices in life to prioritize getting a high salary over other benefits like ""samahan"" or ""paid in company stock options"". Ibang usapan na siyempre if your company provides a very good HMO. Cringy pero still true - ""health is wealth"".

My parents were right - it only takes 1 major medical problem to submarine you to bankruptcy.

Lahat ng sinasabi nya parang hindi nagtutugma and she’s projecting her stuff on me kasi alam ko namang hindi ako yung sinasabi nyang ako. Lol. Here’s the instances why I claim what I claim about her. 

1. May Quarterly conversations kami and one point that she said was matagal daw ako magreply and I should be honest and tell her if may problem sa bahay or what. I never missed any of her chats unless 2 mins delay is that long for her. Pero sya inaabot ng hours bago magreply, like girl. 

2. 1 mistake seems like it’s the end of the world. May hinihingi sakanyang file which, pinasa nya sakin kasi busy daw sya Nagawa ko yung half pero yung half pinasa ko kinabukasan kasi ang dami nyang pa-prio na prio naman tlga and then sasabihan akong hindi ako generous sa time and effort. I handled payroll single handedly nung wala sya ng 1 week, I handled every single employee na nagrereklamo sa sagutan nya sa mga concerns and lahat ng pinagawa nya hindi lumalampas ng 1 hr napapasa ko na. Again, girl. 

3. I don’t mind her delagating stuff pero di ko kailangan ng lahat ng screenshot mo na pinapagawa sayo ng head o ano, ibigay mo nalang. Di ko kailangan ng drama. 

4. “Love the company” like why? oo galante ang company pero at the end of the day, symbiotic relationship yan, you gain from the company they gain from you. Di ko kailangan magpaka-simp. 
5. Swerte ko raw kasi di nya pinapasa sakin yung galit na natatanggap nya sa mga boss. Edi ipasa mo, utang na loob ko pa ba yan. It just shows how weak of a leader you are na hindi mo kayang mag stand sa pressures ng nasa taas. 


I’ve had the worst boss in my life pero pag-alis ko sa company, 
nagpasalamat pa ako kasi ang laki ng naituro nya sakin. All the bosses na nadaanan ko were really great and they really know what they’re doing. Pero eto, hindi na nga marunong mag-look up at Pivot table, over dramatic, praning at weak pa.

July 2022 graduation namin and ang tagal ko naghanap ng work, pasa ng resume sa kahit saang website and company. Halos araw araw nag-aapply sa Indeed, Kalibrr, JobStreet, pati nga sa FB naghanap na din ako. Okay naman resume ko, may ibubuga naman skills ko and may latin honor din ako. Pero after final interview, sasabihin na may nahire na sila.

Finally, November 2022 may tumanggap na din sakin, and start na din pala nun yung pagbaba ng mental health ko. Sana pinansin ko na as a red flag yung late yung interviewer. Then ilang araw na wala parin silang sinesend na contract (kala ko kasi in person nila ibibigay at ipapapirma yun kaya nag go padin ako). Wala silang sinasabi about sa pag-open ng bank for paycheck (yun pala iaabot sayong nakasobre). Nagtatanong ako sa email and text about contract, pero di sinasagot ng HR. Naive pa ko that time kaya nagpasa padin ako ng requirements. 

Okay naman sa simula, pero habang tumatagal napapansin mo na yung mga co-workers mo na inaabuso ka, utos doon utos diyan, kala mo sila may-ari nung company, plastikan and super toxic ng co-worker ko.

My probi period will end on 27th Dec 2023 , nag resign ako ng Dec 11, reasons: delayed salary, binawasan ang working hours na wala sa pinirmahan ko, toxic management. Pasalamat na lang ako kasi nasa mama ko ako hanggang ngayon at walang sariling pamilyang binubuhay. Jusq.

Past couple of months, inabisuhan na kami na magkakatanggalan so better maghanap na ng trabaho to which I did and got a JO now, 5x better than my current job. Tama naman ginawa ko kasi I never kne what will happen next. Pinili ako mag stay sa company but again kung ako ang nasa position ng mga natanggal that time, mahirap, and kung hindi rin sila nahirapan magtanggal ng trabahante, hindi rin ako magihirapan magdecide umalis, nagkataon lang na ako ang napili. Sobrang unjust ng nangyari, that time.

Going back, nag email na ako ng resignation, again Im a probi, no need ng approval but the next company requires me a signed resignation letter? Of which hindi ko gets, so need ko pa rin pala hingin approval nila to which I did a follow up sa HR and supervisor ko. I got ""hahahaha"" ""ayoko nga"" and ""angry reax"" sa message ko na nakikisuyo nang maayos. It pissed me off , kasi matatanda na sila for me to get that as an answer,  hindi naman ako nakikipagbiruan. 

Add, the HR told me na , usually 2weeks na lang dapat ko irender.

Di ko gets yung mga pasada nila hmm.

I sent him all the screenshots and proof that my grandad has passed and why i needed to extend my leave. Even showed proof that I was in the plane and i am home in manila already when I got the news. 

Sent him the day of the funeral & everything. 

Friday was the funeral and the next following Monday was my flight back to Manila again. When I logged into work, I saw that I had a major meeting in a few hours IN THAT MONDAY itself a whole ppt presentation and everything. I saw the day he booked me for a meeting & it was Friday.

•They expect you to immediately be good at something they gave you 1 week ago when they themselves use Google for commands.

•Shifting schedule during internship (morning - mid) and (morning - mid - graveyard) during ""bootcamp"" and regularization.
•May 3 months ""training"" and 6 months ""bootcamp"" before regularization (code name for gagatasan ka before ka maging regular).

930,Ampanget ng Tagumpay P.T 2,"Ampanget ng tagumpay part 2.
So kung maalala niyo, ako ang nagpost ng shitty rant about sa company where Deej is the endorserrrrrrrrrr.. IYKYK https://www.reddit.com/r/AntiworkPH/s/AYB7KOdvzC 

So part 2 lang. December 1, nalaman ko na 283rd ang Alliance Group of Companies sa ""PH forbes best employer in the world."" Kassma rito ang liquor company na pinag ttrabahuhan ko. Wow 283rd BEST EMPLOYER sa buong mundo. Ang galing! Also, they earned Billions of money in 9 months wow ang galing!!!!! Pero ang baba ng sahod ng mga taong nagiging susi kung bakit kumikita ng ganon kalaki yung kumpanya. Proud pa yung HR manager na nasa 283rd kami na best employer. Walang best employer kung hindi niyo kayang pangalagaan mga empleyado ninyo. Ang tunog ng pangalan niyo sa labas, pero ang bulok at ang papangit ng mga taong nasa loob. :) 

Una, bulok ang sistema. Lahat ng bagay don manual pa rin. 🤣 Timekeeping, attendance. Halos lahat nabubuhay na sa system, pero kami naiwan ata kami sa biometrics at dtr. 🤣 Nagrereklamo na mga empleyadong taga branches lalo na ang mga brand promoters kasi late ang pasahod sa kanila, paano ba naman kasi, dtr pa rin ang galawan. Yung ibang kumpanya nag invest sa HR System. Pero kami nastuck, hahaha bilyon kinikita ng kumpanya pero ayaw maglabas ng pera para mapabilis ang galaw ng mga empleyado sa loob. Takot magrisk ang mga matatandang nasa position kasi gusto nila alagaan yung ""legacy"" nila. Legacy my ass. Mamamatay na kayo, pero kami matagal pa kaming mabubuhay, inuuna niyo lang mga sarili niyo mga hayop kayo. 

Pangalawa, pansin niyo, mga pic ng advertising namin ay plain? Laging nag playsafe yang mga nagdedecide non at naglalabas or nagpopost non. Pano kasi, kahit may mga magandang ideya sila, laging nirereject ng mga nasa taas. Ang gaganda ng mga advocacy, ang gaganda ng ads ng ibang company, kami nastuck sa playing safe. Ayaw kasi aprubahan yung mga magagandang ideya. Hahaha kaya maraming umaalis na batang marketing eh lols. 

Pangatlo, ""Ay nagpapaiyak ka ng empleyado"" - sabi ng HR manager namin. ""Oo, marami nang umiyak sa akin"" - sabi ng Internal Credit Audit Head. ""Ay talaga? Hahaha Ang galing mo naman"" - Sabi ng HR manager. Nagpintig yung tenga ko rito. Hahahahaha. Bakit niyo ginagawang tropy ang may napapaiyak na empleyado? Ganyan ba kayong may mga inferioty complex hiding from your superiority complex? Hahaha. HR manager ka pa naman, pero ok ka sa ganong palakad. Yikes. 

Pang-apat. I source for talents sa company namin specifically Luzon provinces. Maraming nagreresign sa area ko because of big offers from other companies, so nabutas yung area ko and luckily, mabilis din ako magsource. Bago mag christmas, almost 5 people resigned sa area ko, yubg katabi ko and kateam ko, abg saya niya na nauubos yung sa area ko. Same kami na Luzon area. Proud na proud siya na may nagreresign sakin sa kaniya wala. And di naman ako affected sa mass resignation and december resignation, kasi expected ko na yon lalo na etong patapos na ng taon. For sure mas marami yan ng jan to feb. Sabi niya ""Okay lang yan *insert my name*"" full smile, halata mong nang-aasar siya. Sabi ko ""Hindi naman siya nakakalungkot. Expected na pangyayari naman na yon, so di ako bothered sa resignations. Eh plus, recruitment naman ako, trabaho ko maghanap"" tas di ako pinansin hahaha. My workmate na yon, favorite siya ng HR director namin kasi she was from UST and fsvorute din siya ng HR manager namin, kasi vibes sila pagdating sa branded things. And eto yung kinwento ko sa part 1 na walang expi pero 18k ung offer tas ako na may expi 17.5k yung offer. Lols. This workmate also competes with me. So december 11-15 ang pasahan ng attendance ng branches namin, take note manual namin itong ginagawa hahaha. December 13, tapos na ako, so I asked our immediare supervisor if ipprint na for checking. Sabi ng immediate sup ko, go and print para macheck niya na rin. So this co worker, biglang sumigaw ng ""WAG"". Tas sabi ng immediare sup namin ""Bakit?"" And she told some alibi na di ko maintindihan. Hahahaha kasi nagprint ako. So ayon, naprint na, naipasa ko na. I can see her rushing her attendance, and before lunch, tapos na siya. Dali-dali siyang nagprint, and pinasa kay immediate sup. So fast forward, nabalik na sakin yung ginawa ko for revision and luckily, wala pang 5 yung revision sakin, so naayos at naprint ko agad. And done na ako, balik ako sa recruitment. Tas naoverheard ko silang dalawa ng immediate sup namin na nag uusap, mali mali yung gawa ni UST girl na paborito ng lahat na nakikipag compete. Abg dami niyang mali and she even said ""Hala bakit ang dami kong mali?"" Abd our immediate sup said ""Ewan ko sayo"" while laughing jokingly. So marami tuloy siya revision. After that, submission na sa manager, so we are tasked to print sa clean paper. Nagmamadali na naman siya unahan ako, edi hinayaan ko siya. Hahahaha, mali na naman nagawa niya. Lahat ng attendance naprint niya sa scratch so umulit sya. Hahaha. 🤣 Whata funny thing. Gusto mo mauna pero nasstall ka ng kalokohan mo. 

Fifth, mahirap makipagsabayan sa mga tao ron, ang hirap din makimingle. Hahahaha, u know why? If you can't afford to buy things theycan afford, mararamdaman mo yung exclusion sayo ron. Pag nakita nila na puro mumurahin lang gamit mo, they'll easily judge you. Lalo na yung HR officer and HR manager namin 🤣. Silverspooned kasi sila eh. Akala nila lahat ng tao same sa kanilang lifestyle. Hahaha

940,Is it worth it to stay sa company na intern status ka for 9 months?,"I need your advice people. I signed up to be an intern sa isang IT company called O******s. Instead of being hired as an employee, I will be a consultant if mag regular na. They have this thing called ""Academy"" wherein they will train you for 3 months and may bootcamp daw the next 6 months. The allowance I have now is 20k no tax and no benefits. They did say na magkaka significant increase daw during bootcamp. So in total, it would take 9 months before regularization. It's kinda suspicious na din for me kasi 9 months prior to regularization? Usually it's just 3 or 6. Sa 9 months na yon walang benefits at all unlike sa other companies. Medyo skeptical na ako kasi parang andaming bad reviews and yung work schedule parang di na maka tao. Now nasa 3 month training ako which will end this January and switching schedule from 6 am to 2 pm and 2 pm to 10 pm every 2 weeks. Sa bootcamp daw may additional switching schedule na 10 pm to 6 am pero monthly na ang switching. May option na wfh like once a week pero may schedule na weekends papasok ka parin. What I've noticed is that sa company na to, walang holidays. Walang double pay pero ""premium pay"" lang ang sabi. Tapos HMO lang at yung SSS is ikaw pa maghuhulog. Binibida nila na tax free ang regular employees daw pero ayon no benefits din at mas malala no 13th month pay. Performance bonus lang daw which is again, suspicious. Parang labag na labag sa rules ng DOLE and parang outsourcing agency lang? Another thing is, andaming bakanteng position sa senior level? Then nag mamass hire interns na sobrang baba ng allowance for an RTO set up sa city. Pag mag regular daw yung sweldo around 60k na din but no yearly increase unless sipsip ka daw sa management.

947,Can a manager suddenly shorten ny rendering period just because he feels like it?,"So,, I'm in my first week of my rendering period. And I'm currently training the new hired, the one that's replacing my position. He specifically told the new hired to learn everything in span of 4 days, so she has to do all the tasks on her own starting next week. 
We all know it's so d@mn impossible to learn everything, especially with payroll and compensation & Benefits in 4 days. 

Now, the reason why I'm thinking what if our manager suddenly inform me next week about not having to go to office and work anymore because ""the newly hired already knows how to do it""......  is because this specific manager fckng hates me to the core. He hates me because I complained to the head office all the mismanagement, him looking down to other employees, yelling at us, and telling us to fire someone just because they answered back to his message since apparently he said ""A manager shouldn't be talking to the low class employee who has no power"".. 

So, I know he's been looking forward to kick me out in the office because he can't stand that I look at him in the eyes quietly whenever he's yelling at me because I know I didn't do anything wrong, he hates that ""I look proud of myself"" when he's yelling at me. For him, he find it rude. That I'm being a btch when I do that.

Earlier today, I find myself filing SL because of hypertension and hindi ako makapasok sa office. I notified the execs na I will do the report earlier this morning (around 9am) and will submit it by afternoon.

Aba, etong boss na to e pinapaanak ako ng report na I just barely started at i-submit ko sa kanya. So I sent her a screenshot of my laptop na ginagawa ko pa yung report. I was asked anong oras matatapos, I said mga 12.

Aba, pinagmamadali ako. So I said to her, ""Mam, kung pwede ko lang i-ChatGPT to (para mabilis matapos), nagawa ko na.""

Minasama pa ko netong boss na to. Mali daw ako. So sinagot ko aba, mali din na pagmamadaliin nyo ako sa report na currently ginagawa ko naman din, while naka-SL ako, and you want me to submit the report now.

They're adding another company, Company D, next year, diluting my focus even further. From 33% per company, I'm expected to manage with just 25% of my time with a raise that will reach 6 digits. Yet, no additional staff! That's so absurd, and they are stretching me like a rubber band, even if they are rewarding good work with more work.

I love my work colleagues and juniors in A, B, and C. They respect me, and I was given peer recognition during our last year-end party. Some managers likes me too. But the disrespectful nepo baby, the President's favoritism and the insane workload that awaits me next year are crushing me.

Do I stick it out for the sake of ""good work"" or prioritize my sanity by resigning? It's hard to leave my colleagues, and I have only stayed in the company for more than a year. I don't know how long my emergency fund will last or how soon I can find a new job. I don't know if I'm wasting my potential here or if I am throwing everything away just because of my nepotistic former supervisor, whom I don't get along with. 

TLDR: I manage marketing for three struggling startups under a toxic, nepotistic supervisor. Now, they want me to handle four with no additional support.

ff, after 2 weeks sa pag aapply. Na invite for final interview sa isa sa mga initial interview na naipasa ko.

So ayun. I rejected the offer kasi. Ibang iba talaga naranasan ko kumpara sa ibanginterview na na take ko. Pag ka introduce ko palang sa sarili ko,  ki-nut off na agad ako ng isa sa tatlong interviewer, na bakit daw ako nanginginig. Dahil nga ba daw ay sa interview? Personally daw ayaw nya sa ganun kasi sa tingin nya maraming mga hindi totoong salita binibitawan ang candidate para lang ma hire. Which is sa point ko naman is nagets ko siya. Pero hindi ba to valid na kina kabahan lang ako, at final interview ko na ito. Normal lang na paghandaan ko ang mga possible na tanong para sa ganitong sitwason. 

Sinabihan pa ako na may problema daw ako psychologically, or nang rereverse psychology ba daw ako sa mga taong makakaharap ko para makuha gusto ko. Dagdag pa Na may galit ba daw ako sa sitwasyon ko na mahirap lang ako. At yung passion ko daw hindi totoo kasi ang hinahangad ko lang ay pera hindi trabaho. Basta ang dami niyang sinasabi na isa daw akong arrogante, feeling superior daw ako. Doble kara, sinama nya pa pamilya ko na galit ba daw ako sa kanila dahil sa sitwasyon namin ngayon na mahirap.

Until some point na tumahan na siya kaka duda sakin. Di na kasi ako nag defend sa sarili ko sa mga pang huhusga nyang tanong aakin. i coconsider parin daa nila ako at ihire daw nila ako. tas ayon tinanong previous salary ko. Sinabi ko 12,000. Sumbat naman ng manager papayag ba daw ako na yun din starting ko. Sabi ko hindi, at nag reason out ako na sa huling trabaho ko, Nahihirapan ako i manage yung income na yun. Sabay sabi nila, kahit daw magkano salary ko. Kung di daw ako madisiplina sa pera, kahit magkano daw ay hindi talaga isasapat. Grabe, ang daming judge na nangyari sakin sa interview na yun. Tinaasan hanggang 15,000. Final na daw, sabi ko hindi nalang muna. Inisip ko kasi, napakadsming panghuhusga na nangyari sakin during that time at dagdag pa na sinama pamilya ko. naisip ko din na hindi ko nga kinaya mentally pang huhusga sakin, how much more if employed na ako sa kanila?

958,Shoutout sa Labor Violator na company na ito,"If you know anyone looking for a job do not consider this health service provider. 



Dear All OICs, AOICs, ________________ and staff, 

Starting January 2024, the following changes in OT and commission will take place. Please read carefully and understand. If you have any questions, please feel free to send me message. I will answer all questions, so we can make this new policy as clear as possible to everybody. 

*OVERTIME* 

As per general policy, we will discourage unnecessary overtime (OT) to reduce our operations expense. However, for certain situations, OT will be allowed subject to approval by ME or by your area managers or regional manager. 

ALL OTs should be pre-approved before the actual schedule. Please send me the OT form together with written explanation why OT is necessary for that particular situation (example : 3 day sale, extended mall hours, shortage of staff due to leave). 

For OT approval AFTER the schedule, please send me the OT form together with written explanation for the OT and corresponding proof indicating the need to do OT (example, sales report with time stamp signifying the time for the transaction). 

All unauthorized OTs (without approval) will not be paid by accounting.

Just to be VERY CLEAR: OT is stilled allowed, but OIC needs to justify the OT of every staff. UNAUTHORIZED OT will not be paid. 

*COMMISSION:* Take note, this change will affect SALES STAFF ONLY. 

Sales STAFF should have a minimum sales transactions and/or amount for them to receive their commission. If the staff fails to reach the minimum allowed sales transaction or amount, the sales staff will not receive their commission for the month. Only the add-ons will be released. 

By definition, TRANSACTION means complete prescriptions or frame only. All contact lens, CL solutions and accesories sales are not included in this total transaction. 

The following will be the minimum: 

Full Time Sales Staff:
15 transactions a day or 390 transactions per month OR 
₱300,000 sales  a month 

Sales/Asst Cashier or Sales/Asst Technician: 
10 transactions a day or 260 transactions per month OR
₱200,000 sales a month 

Sales Staff who continually do not reach their required number of sales transactions or amount for 2 consecutive months will be given a warning.
2 consecutive months - verbal warning 
4 consecutive months - written warning 
6 consecutive months - suspension 3 days
8 consecutive months - suspension 7 days
10 consecutive months - suspension 15 days
12 consecutive months - termination 

All probationary sales who will not reach the minimum target for 5 months will not be regularized. (3rd month evaluation is needed) 

We will have a revised quota form for next year to include the number of transactions for each sales staff. Please make sure the numbers in the quota form are correct and accurate. We will check the figures in the forms vs the encoder report. All incorrect numbers in the form will be considered as falsified and corresponding disciplinary action will be given to whoever is responsible. 

Effectivity of sanctions will take effect starting March 2024 commission. We can start implementing these in our stores as early as January 2024. No penalties, sanctions and forfeiture of commission yet for January and February 2024. 

For OT, start by reducing unneccesary OTs of the staff. No need to send for approval yet. 

For the sales commission, inform the sales staff of the change so they will be ready when this is implemented by March 2024. 

Everything written above is subject to change and will be finalized during OIC meeting in February.

Thank you for your cooperation. Again, for inquiries and clarifications, pls viber me.
Reminder about the memo regarding OT and sales staff:

Please discuss these with your staff properly during a proper meeting, and not just share in your group chat. Let them know that it will be implemented after the OIC meeting. If they have questions about the memo, please take note so we can have a discussion during the OIC meeting.

If there are negative reactions from staff, PLEASE make sure that you reply to them POSITIVELY.",16,12,0.86,True,Company alert 🚩,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/18vqy1k/shoutout_sa_labor_violator_na_company_na_ito/,2024-01-01 14:40:24,18vqy1k

963,Scammer Alert,"Do not engage in any business with this individual. 
His name is Alfonso James Lacson. He claims to have a lot of SUCCESSFUL businesses under his belt. Namely D'Lacs, GIB (Gourmet in a Box). He will alsi claim to have established Palpitate. He will claim that he has a farm (does not specify what type, nor does respond properly to inquiry), he will also claim to have a resort and many more. Basically he claims to have a lot and accomplished a lot, which are all very questionable since it either does not exist or he cannot give proof. 

His modus: he likes hiring students that are looking for work. He specifically targets those who are deperate with work. He will promise lots of things like incentives, but fails to pay out their salary.

How do i know: i work with him at GIB, he was always delayed with giving out salaries, the delay gets longer and longer over time to the point where he owes his employees a whole month's worth. He still hasn't fully paid my salary until now. That's 3 months worth of salary from a year ago.

Why this guy sucks beyond what was already mentioned. He loves posting online, he constantly looks for ""investors"" for his business. He will basically offer ""investors"" a ln 8% cut of the monthly profit but the payout is locked every 6 months or more, the contract is good for 3 years. What ge doesn't tell the ""investors"" is how the profit is calculated. He tell the ""investors"" there are only 10 slots, which translates to the investors getting 80% of the total PROFIT all together, but in reality, he grabs additional investors behind the backs of the original 10 and promises the same 8%. He keeps doing this to keep getting more money to pay out his first batch of ""investors"" basically a ponzi scheme.

How does this guy earn money if he gives all the profit away? The resturant gets its stock from him. The resturant buys the stocks from him.

He also like to throw around shit like ""lawyer up"" when his young and inexperienced staff asks about their salary, ir when his ""investors"" even inquire about the business. He plays the victim every step of the way while getting the sales (yes, raw sales) from the store to buy his personal shit like a bottle of red wine which he will consume in the same store where he got the money from, in front of the staff he doesn't pay salaries to, because of his reason ""the store doesn't have enough sales""

Like nagkwento yung HR manager na may mga applicants daw na nirereject JO nila even though pasok yung expected salary, kasi nakahanap ng mas better na offer. For me kaya nga yung isa yung tinanggap eh. Kasi nga BETTER. Kesyo nahahassle daw sila kasi nga ang tagal ng proseso tapos irereject lang JO. Sana daw di ako ganun. Para sakin- Part ng recruitment process yon.


Bakit daw xxx,xxx yung asking ko eh 29 lang daw ako. May pamilya daw ba akong binubuhay. Breadwinner daw ba ako. Etc? Eh yung asking ko pasok naman sa ads nila sa jobstreet. Saka yung current ko almost ganun nadin so pataas talaga hihingin ko di naman pwede bumaba. Kailangan ko bang may pamilyang binubuhay para majustify expected salary ko?

Out of courtesy I just smiled and answered their questions professionally. If may questions or followups daw itext ko lang sila.

One week after, wala pading balita. So nagfollowup ako via text. No response.

After that, I assumed na wala na. Right after a week may JO nadin ako sa ibang company na mas ok na friendly mga HR. May start date nadin ako 

Tapos kahapon nagchat yung recruiter, may update na daw sa application ko. Dinedma ko lang kasi sobrang na off na ko sa interview, tapos hindi pa ko nireplyan 4 weeks ago. Kahit manlang sabihin na waiting for update. Wala eh. So hindi ko na nireplyan

Kanina tumawag yung HR manager, if open padin ba ako. I just said I followed up weeks ago and got no response thus i assumed na I did not get the role. And may JO nadin ako.

Recruiters be professional naman. Mas okay magreply na hindi selected or pending pa. Or kahit provide updates manlang sa applicant nyo. Jusko.

816,Should I quit even without 1 year of service [health issues],"I’m 22 yo (fresh grad kinda) Debating if I should quit my job— health issues. 
I have asthma and I work in a hospital, although I’m not a medical practitioner. Early December before Christmas break (December 15), I was already sick probably bc of the environment of the hospital. I was sick the whole holidays. I was finally sickness-free just this Sunday. I went to work this Tuesday for the first time and got sick again — colds, cough, asthma, fever, allergies. My dilemma is I haven’t reached 1 year of service yet, I am currently on my 9th month and my last job was only 6 months…. I’m afraid it will look bad on my CV since I haven’t completed a year. 

Bg
- I have asthma 
- I’m underpaid, pay is just enough to buy food and leisure (clothes/food) but not enough to pay for rent or a car 
- I don’t pay rent / groceries - I’m reliant to my parent  
- Medical field is not my field, I chose it bc I was in a tight spot months ago and needed the money 
- I have savings that could last a couple of months 
Pros of staying 
- people are nice, I made some friends 
- Boss is nice (but won’t let us work from home lol)
- will have 1 year of experience 
Cons of staying 
- physical environment is unhealthy, getting exposed to patients 
- underpaid, no growth",2,2,0.75,True,Advice Needed 🤔,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/18xgrqy/should_i_quit_even_without_1_year_of_service/,2024-01-03 18:59:17,18xgrqy

I received a formal confirmation in email about passing the hiring process and i said naman from the start yung expected salary ko. I submitted all the requirements for the pre-job offer (payslip, form, consent to do CI, etc.). I did a follow up after 1 week and HR confirmed na pending pa sa hiring manager. After 2 weeks, did same follow up and same reason na pending with hiring manager. After 3 weeks, I did a follow up and said na yung CI na ginawa nila could negatively impact me in my company kasi potentially, i would be in attrition list which means hindi ka bibigyan ng project and alay ka for low rating. HR came back and said the hiring manager would not push thru hiring me kasi mag kaka salary imbalance sa team kasi puro home grown daw yung sa team. I was dissappointed and did not expect it kasi Multinational siya. I provided a transparent feedback dun sa HR na from the start, na sabi naman yung expected salary tapos yung CI na ginawa nila could negatively impact me. Sana hindi sila nag CI if hindi pa sila 100% for job offer. She replied na possible naman yung asking but yung hiring manager may issue.

Excluded ang lunch nun. 6 months na ako at regular na din. Pero nagreklamo tong Accounting Manager namin kasi late daw kami pumapasok like lagpas na ng 9AM pero di lagpas ng 9:30. I was like, ang pagkakainform sa akin ng OM namin na until 9:30 ang pasok. Tapos nagagalit sya na 5:45 umaalis na kami. Take note, halos araw araw yung lunch break namin hindi umaabot ng 1 hr.

I can't really recall when, other than at some point, I started falling to the idea that any kind of learning that has no upskill or marketing value isn't worthwhile.

This essentially sucks because I have a lot of interests that has huge learning curves (painting, languages & writing among them), while not inherently marketable. Whenever I'd get to them the thought of not being productive or efficient enough makes the process of ""just learning things"" almost unfulfilling.

1. Nag absent ako before (notified my TL) and since probi palang ako, hindi kami pinagagamit ng leave even though we already accrue leave credits since day 1. So nag LWOP ako nun and then nakita ko sa next payslip ko yung De Minimis allowance ko nabawasan. I asked payroll regarding this and they said that HR advised them that kasama sa bawas yun since hindi ako pumasok. Question is tama ba yun? If so, or not, meron ba kayong link or document regarding this information sa De Minimis?

2. Since nag aaccrue na nga kami ng SL and VL since day 1, nakapag accrue na kami ng 6.25 SL in total since nag start kami Aug 2023. Jan 2024 nag reset sya to 1.3 at ang explanation sa amin ay dapat talaga magrereset sya since di ginagamit.

I  hope companies realize that while they have an upper hand, it should always be a 2-way street relationship with your employee. The longest I’ve been with a company is 3 years and 2 months because I was working with a good boss, solid collaborative team, had trainings to upskill myself aside from on-the-job experience and good benefits. But I resigned kahit I got promoted because I wasn’t given a fair chance to apply for the role I want because of recent promotion and lock-in period after promotion, and I felt I’ve outgrown yung work ko kahit na promote ako.

In essence, lapag muna ako 70k saka tatakbo yung 30 days then I can leave. Eh ang plano ko sana after my final day ko na bayaran or during the 30 day render period, para pagdating ng last day ko, bounce na ako.

828,Plans during medical leave,"I would like to share a story of an IT employee who’s on medical leave and his immediate supervisor is asking full details why he is on medical leave.

Etong si employee ay merong medical condition. Now I can say di naman nag kulang ung employee like doing medical test kahit na may issue sa system ni PhilHealth and maraming hospital and clinic who’s refusing to use his HMO or HMO is not honored sa mismong facility.

Now employee explained via chat which is Viber ano ung nakasulat sa medical certificate. Photos is included on the chat as per employee. Like, ano ung medical condition. Ano ung recommendation ng doctor. Until when yung medical rest.

And here’s the best part. His immediate supervisor is asking His plans while on medical leave. Jesus Christ, kailangan pa ba malaman eto ng company? It’s clearly explained via chat what’s going on.

Idk if tanga yung supervisor or inutil ung manager to know ano ung plan ng employee while on medical rest. If you’re thinking na etong employee is cookin something, give a shot to call the clinic where the documents came from.

I admit gumawa ako ng excuse just not come to work by sending medical documents. Pero ung tatanungin ka ng plans while on medical rest. What the hell.

To his Immediate supervisor and Immediate manager, saludo ako sa inyo. “Continental Fuck You”. I hope if mag medical leave kayo tanungin din kayo ng mga tao nyo what’s your plan while on medical leave.

835,Nag-resign ako without a back up job. Here's why,"Basically hindi na ako masaya sa ginagawa ko sa previous  job ko. Regular 8-5 office job sa government, entitled ako sa mga benefits na almost the same sa regular (FYI Im not a permanent employee). Pero dahil ang dami kong workload at mag-isa ko lang gagawa nung trabaho, I found myself working during the holidays and weekend. Madalas pa akong mag-uwi ng trabaho just to accomplish my tasks on time and yet hindi ito nare-recognize ng management. Almost 4 years na ako sa institution na yun pero palagi akong hindi nakukuha for regular appointment sa government. Syempre you know naman pag sa government (palakasan). Sobrang mentally exhausted ako kasi kahit weekend may nagcha-chat sa messenger ko or sa phone number about sa work. Tapos hindi ako nauubusan ng trabahong ginagawa. Kaya napakadalang ko mag leave nun unless very important. Once na nag-leave ako, maiiipon lang nang maiipon ang trabahong iniwan ko. Unlike sa ibang department, they have colleagues who can take over their job pag absent si employee. I tried to subtly tell my concern sa supervisor ko pero yung pag-kuha ng assistant is not their priority. Tapos despite na nagpupuyat ako para matapos ang trabaho, they keep on pushing me to work faster. Indirectly nilang sinasabi na ""Nasaan na? Tapos na ba?"". May mga iba pang dahilan kung bakit ako nag-resign pero I dont want to disclose it any further. May ipon pa naman ako, naka reserve to pay my monthly bills. Since 12/23/23 unemployed na ako. Ang hirap pala mag-transition from a regular office job into a remote job. Twice na ako na-reject sa agency na inaplayan ko. Any good advice you can give me? Nilalamon ako ng negativity but as much as possible I want to be positive.

Pangarap ko talagang makakuha ng remote job. BTW, nakahinga ako ng maluwag nung nag-resign ako. Pakiramdam ko nakalaya ako sa tali.

844,3 year employment bond at rustans / stores specialists inc,"
So i’ve been working at rustan’s now for about 2 years and have been hating the job for awhile due to the intense workload and stressful work environment. Its been so crazy! We work overtime with no pay and even on weekends. 

I’ve been thinking of quitting for the past 3 months but haven’t had the heart to do it due to the 100K 3 year bond… 100k is a lot of money that I don’t have, but i’m honestly willing to risk it as its not worth it na talaga to stay for another year. 

Pay is low, benefits are lacking and company politics is such a big thing! The company’s so traditional that everything is manual. Although I love working with my work friends, but the work load is just too much. We don’t even have sweldo increase! I’ve been having serious anxiety due to this job na. 

Has anyone worked at rustans or ssi and did not finish the 3 year bond period? Where you required to pay the 100k bond? Please I just need some insights so I can make an informed decision.

851,Should I confront or report toxic co-workers?,"Hi everyone! I hope your work life is not giving you unnecessary stress at the moment.

Anyway, I just want to ask your opinions on how I should go about this situation. For context, I am an overseas Filipino teacher and last year, I was the only Filipino left in our faculty. Months later, the school hired 4 more Filipinos and I was so happy kasi finally, may makakausap na ako! 😫😭 The previous Filipino co-workers that I had were nice people so I miss having that warm connection kaya I can’t believe a fellow Filipino would do this behind my back. 🥲

I helped the 4 of them ease up in our workplace and also assisted them regarding visa matters, accommodation, transpo, work-related paperwork, etc., without thinking much about it. I want to give back and pass on the kindness and warmth that my previous Filipino co-workers did for me. Until, nag-away2 sila kasi iisa lang ang apartment nila. Their personalities just don’t click, ika nga. 1 of them eventually left the school and 3 of them stayed. Tapos nag-aaway na naman sila hanggang naging 2 (let’s call them Terry and Tina) vs 1 (Lenny) na. I clarified to both sides na I don’t want to get involved and to keep their misunderstandings between them. I told them to communicate and just be civil with one another if it’s beyond repair. I thought it worked. 

Fast forward a few months later, Lenny, yung nag-iisa na lang, spread gossip about me to other students that Terry, Tina and I daw are the reason why the teachers don’t like staying in the office. 

I was so surprised kasi ni hindi nga ako nangingialam sa away nila at sa kanya personally. And she just asked for my help 2 weeks ago about a non-work related stuff and I still helped her out thinking we’re okay. The students did not believe her crappy story and told me about it because they know my personality and attitude in and out of work. 

I also learned that she is hanging out with the other foreign teachers outside of work and I felt like the other foreigners won’t hang out with the rest of the Filipinos na lang kasi she had already tainted our reputations to them. 

The students told me that she (Lenny) asked them which teachers they like and the students replied that they prefer me (kasi siguro mas matagal na ako) and Terry, to which Lenny replied, “If they are nice to you, well, not to us. The other teachers don’t like staying in the office because of them.” 

Nakakaput@ng1n4 talaga. I am hurt and disappointed kasi fellow Filipino pa ang gumagawa non and I haven’t done anything to her personally to make her react that way towards me. I would even defend her before if she did something that our bosses did not like (e.g., calling some of the students “stupid”), non-English speaking country kasi tinuturuan namin kaya out of frustration, nasasabihan nya ng ganon ang mga bata. Huhuhu. 

Now, I am torn if I should tell the HR officer about her behavior because it’s making a rift between Filipinos and other foreign teachers or i-confront ko na lang talaga siya. But at the same time, I am thinking na I should just let it go na lang. 😭 Kaso naiirita ako pag naalala ko na hindi ko ma defend ang self ko especially sa ibang tao na napagsabihan nya na ng hindi nman totoo.

859,I Hate Corporate Politics (Referral System),"I f*cking hate my current situation right now. 

Storytime! Currently a supervisor for a mid-level firm handling a small group. Due to the increased workload, I previously requested additional headcount to help my team. We can't find the right match because of salary restriction and delayed the hiring process.

Then here comes the other supervisor referring a ""friend"" (Brother of her husband) to join my team. The f*cked up thing here is I got bypass and directly referred  it to our manager (which is her office bestfriend) and passed the interview.

The referral was over-qualified, around 50's, previous work was a general manager of his own firm (bankrupt by pandemic). His experience is a lot but its not aligned with what we needed in the team.

My manager is now insisting to hire the referral to provide guidance to me and my team with his experience, since they see us as a young team (in short having a seniority).

Honestly I see it as a threat to my position but what I can't really sacrifice is the collaboration of my team right now. It would technically disrupt the workflow.

PS: I have a candidate who passed my interview but my manager is doubting it since he has junior experience.

I have all the clerical skills needed, I have graphic design skills, MS Office, Adobe, lead generation, social media management, WordPress and all that.

For the past few months I've been immersing myself in ""corporate culture"" in preparation for job hunting. I took a short course din and it's part of the training to be familiar with all this. Yung pananalita, cover letters, LinkedIn, resumés, portfolios, CEOs and HR. The more I am in this space, the more I'm starting to lose my mind.

Parang everything is just so self centered. I mean I get it I really do. I want a job too, for me. It's not like I care about a company wholeheartedly kaya ko gusto makapasok sakanila, right? That's the problem, sa interview pa lang you have to be enthusiastic about the job and the company. It all feels so superficial, but we have to do it to earn any sort of worth for ourselves. Tell me why an interviewer and I are engaged in a purely English phone call for a position that doesn't require me to speak, both of us trying to mask our Filipino accents, just to appease the corporate entity? I'm not trying to sound edgy but it's true.

And who would've thought na konting tweaks lang pala sa resumé would land you an interview? No need to upskill in anything, no. In the interview just be better at talking and overselling yourself and you're all good. Just straight up lying is how everything works in corporate? Just be convincing? Hindi na ba nagbabase sa skills and competence ang position? Bentang benta ba sa interviewers kapag pinormahan mo sila ng social skills mo?

Not to mention marketing. You're telling me someone out there can convince me to buy dog sh!t because he has the marketing skills? I'm just slowly going insane the more I look into the behind the scenes. Does no one care about anyone anymore? Do we all only ""care"" about a person if they're generating income for the company? Where is the altruism in all this? Parang all the skills and personal growth na na-achieve at pinag-aralan mo, ang purpose lang pala non ay para makapag benta ka ng product?

Worst part is I know I have to play this game kung gusto ko maka-survive sa araw araw. I want to be successful too pero idk how I'll be competing with the most soulless marketing rep out there who has the ability to sell you a piece of fudgee bar worth your entire retirement fund, without feeling a thing.

I had a meeting earlier with Lea who works at another company kasi we will be working on a project together. Nick went with me so he can assist me thru the meeting.

Towards the end, we were just chatting about random stuff when Lea mentioned na she had been in the industry for more than 10 years na daw so I asked if she had met our team leaders, one of which is Amy. 

Lea said they were able to work on several projects before then she mentioned that never nya daw nakita na kumain si Amy and ang laki daw ng pinayat nya. Probably because of stress din daw. 

Nick casually adds, “Really? Parang malaki pa din naman si Amy ngayon,” then looks at me for validation. 

I was taken aback kasi as an insecure person, a comment like that is the last thing I would want anyone saying about me. I ignored him and told them how Amy climbed through the corporate ladder and how much na yung naaccomplish nya. 

Now I had just completed an LMS training about a safe workplace, and Nick’s comment is very similar to the one shown in that training. What would you do if you were in my place? Would you let this pass?

I need an unbiased opinion kaya ako nandito. I already have problems with Nick at work (eg. late sa meeting, will take longer breaks during lunch “para maglakad-lakad” lang) kaya I’m leaning on reporting this particular incident. Or am I making a big deal out of this? Yung other problems were reported by my other colleagues na

There is another event naman when we were in a conference, I have met my previous colleagues (from different companies) na online ko lang nakakausap. We were catching up when one of them pulled me aside to warn me to keep my distance from Nick kasi the reason he left their company is because of a sexual harassment case daw. And this was the second time na I have heard about it. 

I shared these to two of my closest friends, and they’re divided. What would you do?

Nakakatawa tayong mga alipin ng salapi. Imbes na maging magkakampi tayo para labanan ang mga mayayamang kapitalista na uma-alipin sa atin, tayo pa ang nag-a-away-away at nagkakasalungat ng opinyon

Sobrang nakakatawa tayo, na ayaw natin sa mga unyon at nag-i-strike, ayaw natin sa collective bargaining at ayaw din natin sa mga job hoppers. Wala tayong class solidarity

Maybe I'm too harsh pero kung nababayaran lang ng tama ang mga empleyado ayon sa kanilang outputs at nabibigyan ng tamang benepisyo, wala namang magpapalipat-lipat ng trabaho 'diba? Sabi nga nila, kung kasipagan lang ang batayan ng sahod, dapat milyonaryo na ang mga magsasaka at mga labandera. Kung tutuusin, napakahirap na laging maghanap ng bagong trabaho at mag-aral ng bagong kaalaman

Isa ding tanong ko, sa napakaliit na P20,000 na kita ng ordinaryong mangggagawang Pilipino, tingin niyo, magkano ang katumbas na kita ng mga may-ari ng negosyo? For example lang, sa Accenture ka nagtatrabaho. Kung kumikita ka ng P30,000 a month, tingin mo, magkano 'yung totoong budget na binibigay ng client mo sa Accenture? Tingin mo ba, papayag 'yung Accenture na mas malaki ang cut mo?

Sa kakaunting mga kakilala ko na 6-digits o lampas pa ang sahod, wala NI ISA sa kanila ang tumagal ng 10 years sa work. Maaring merong iilan, pero either nepo-hire, nagtapos sa Big 4, madaming connections, o di kaya mga statistical outliers (sinwerte ng sobra). Siguro kung kasama kayo sa statistical outliers, then good for you. Kung ""good"" ang company mo, then good for you too. Pero job hopping is an advice that might not be valid for you, but for the other 99.999% of the working population

Pakialamero na kung pakialamero pero kung pagiging pakialamero at baliw ang mangarap ng mas magandang mundo, na lahat tayo ay matataas ang sahod at hindi kinakailangan na maging mga alipin ng salapi, mas maganda pang maging baliw na lang ako

So ayun, on the third week I've requested to use my remaining 2 VL since sayang naman, then di ako pinapayagan since wala na daw matitira. Like wtf! yung mga higher devs okay lang mag leave tas yung ka same kong role binigyan nila ng 5 VACATION LEAVE CREDITS! Binibigay daw para sa mga newbies or bagohan sa company!

739,How can I demand my Salary?,"How to demand for additional pay?

Hi.

So, I am working as operations assistant.

During interview I asked the scope of work and they said it is processing logistics and keeping up with the production. Typically what I usually do is forward orders to the production floor and prepare all the items for deliveries and booked for pick ups.

I do not mind doing some graphic post, but recently. I was asked to make a catalog of all our products, answer inquiries in our SNS.

My salary is Php500.00/day (provincial rate) and I am no work no pay. That Php500 is for the operations assistant. Now, lately, I noticed my tasks are getting more and more and it is not part of my job description.

Graphics? Catalog? Product Shoot? Aren't  those work for Marketing and PR?

My boss added Php500 on my weekly pay when I started replying to our SNS. I do not mind replying and all, but after working hours and during my rest day (Sundays), I do not reply immediately because I believe that it is not my priority as my working hours is done, but I noticed that my boss is getting naggy when I do not reply immediately or if I missed something during those times.

Things are getting exhausting. I want to demand for extra pay for the extra work, but I do not know how to. I like what I do (packing and all), but the extra tasks is making me feel exhausted.

Mind you, I worked half day on last Dec 24th and Dec 31st, they only pay me Php250/day for that. I didn't receive any pakunswelo de bobo. It just disappointing. 

I am planning to resign, but I still do care about how they will do things if I left, and the location of my work is quite ideal another factor why i do not want to leave. Hahahaha

Anyway to summarize. Here's  what I've been doing for my Php500.00/day and a no work no pay job:
• ALL OPERATIONS
• CUSTOMER SUPPORT
• MARKETING

744,Refusal to Accept Additional Work,"I've been searching the web for any information regarding my current predicament:

Recently, my department was forced to have a ""re-organization"" due to the resignation of one of our members. So basically, one position was ""dissolved"" because they transferred the one assigned to that dissolved position to another role, however, the duties and responsibilities are not dissolve. Based on a close door discussion within some of our heads, it was decided to give those to me without even discussing it with my immediate superior to know whether i can accommodate the additional tasks. They just informed my immediate superior as an FYI basis, without discussing the reason why they chose me to shoulder this additional burden.

They set a meeting to discuss this change, at this point im still clueless to the decision of adding some tasks to me. My immediate superior talked to me one on one prior to the cascade of re-organization to inform me about this change of scope to my work. My position was that I cannot take additional workload and why did they think that I can handle additional workload when in fact neither me nor my immediate superior was consulted about it. The only reason they gave was the other person that they consider was already full.

What happened that day was the heads had a ""pre-meeting"" prior the discussion with us. My immediate superior raised my concern in that pre-meeting. So, what transpired was they parked the discussion of my added roles for another day. They asked to prepare a TMS to check whether I can accommodate the additional tasks.

My concern is that, despite my TMS showing that I cannot accommodate additional tasks, knowing our Senior head, they can position it that they have the full right to change my work load and not cooperating would merit willfull insubordination.

We will be having a discussion tomorrow and will i have strong legal support if I refuse to accept the additional tasks?

To add, there are other personnel that they choose but it seemed that they are insistent into me taking the additional roles as they don't asked other members to do TMS after they made aware of my stand that I cannot accommodate additional task.

Hoping someone can help me. Will highly appreciate if you can aldo help in providing specific legal provisions and actual case study as I was not able to find any similar case nor legal provision on the basis of refusal to take additional responsibility.

UPDATE: Just to update everyone na nakabasa ng hinaing ko. I already found another job with higher position and compensation. So parang blessing in disguise na din tong nangyari since na force ako to seek job outside my current and yun nga napaganda pa. 

As for the events related to my post. What i found out was that kaya pala ganun ang approach ng bagong head namin (internally promoted) because he felt na underloaded ako. His reasoning kung bakit gusto nya ako ioverload (1) when they asked me to cover for someone, i managed to do cover that person so sa kanya madami akong idle time to be able to do that (2) hindi daw nya ako masyado ramdam sa section na hinahawakan nya. 

To be fair my immediate superior and one of the LT defended me outright, na hindi totoo yung mga conclusions nya (sila din nagfefeedback sa akin ng mga nangyayari sa LT meetings nila kaya aware ako sa mga napaguusapan about me).

To clarify yung mga issues nya:

Issue 1: Nagawa kong magcover because at home nagtatrabaho and in werkends nagtatrabaho pa ako to cover kung ano man di ko ginawa dahil may urgent na need gawin like magcover ng ibang empleyado. And besides, this is work related, why is he not questioning other employees na nagagawang umattend ng kape at tsismisan sessions, bday bash, non-work related extra curricular activities.

Issue 2: The problem is hindi naman ako reporting sa kanya, so lahat ng activities ko is reported sa immediate superior ko. Later i found out na during editing ng monthly reports, tinanggal pala nung dating boss namin yung update ko since detailed update sya na hindi na masyado need ng top management since company metrics na lang pinepresent nila. And natigil pa yung group monthly meeting nila in which normally dun sya nadidiscuss. Lastly, for the past 2 yrs wala naman sya niraraise na issue about my output so why now, had he raised this earlier we could have made an alignment of expectations. 

So they officialized the additional role (walang adjustment sa compensation) but, through the help of my immediate superior we managed to convince the top management na i-spread out yung responsibilities sa iba ibang tao. But at this point I'm just buying my time to secure another job. Btw, alam ng immediate superior ko yung plans ko to resign kahit maayos yung sitwasyon since it's the values na ng next department head yung concern ko na I don't want to be in constant battle with the department head just because my prejudice na sya sa akin. Recently, since hindi nagsucceed yung plan nya to overload me the first time,, nagdevice na naman sya ng bagong scheme para ioverload na naman ako which failed again.

Tsismis na lang: isa pang hinala namin bukos sa unang dalawa nyang issues, ay dahil mas malaki sweldo ko kesa sa mga ka-chummy nya na pantay lang ng position ko (external hire ako). Kasi nalaman ko na lahat ng external hire someway or another may issue sya or pinepressure nya to take more responsibilities (not even explicitly discussing with them kung ano ba expected nya, na parang ang dating eh dahil mataas ang sweldo namin need nya makitang nagpapak@mat@y kami sa trabaho).

May lesson ba na dapat matutunan? Di ko din sure, pero eto mga narealize ko sa nangyari:

1. Make good connections. I managed to land a better job faster through the help of my former superior. Not expecting na in less than a month makakahanap agad ako ng lilipatan.
2. Know your worth. Kung di yun makita ng management, look somewhere na makikita ang worth mo. Di natin deserve to be in a constant battle within our own department. Nakakastress na nga yung interaction with outside the department kaya wag mo na idagdag.
3. Kung ayaw mo naman magpapalipat lipat ng work, know how to kiss a$s. Hindi kasi ako chummy sa bago naming manager kaya isa ako bigla sa pinag-iinitan

756,2 months palang felt like quitting na,"Bagong salta. Advertising/Publishing industry nga pala nature ng work ko.

No'ng una excited pako, kasi after more than 5 years makakalipat na. Walang issue previous company, naging comfty nako, masaya environment, dekalidad leadership, madami nang naging friends dahil sa engagement activities, tadtad ng trainings which is an advantage, upskilling din kasi. 'yun lang, yung sahod. Aminin natin, kelangan maka keep up sa living expenses yung sahod natin. Kaya ayon, nagdecide ako lumipat for a greener pasture.

Ngayon dalawang buwan nako pero yung pakiramdam ko parang isang taon nakong empleyado dahil sa hassle na naranasan at nararanasan ko. Wala akong kabatch na nahire. Utay utay sila maghire, ayon wala akong NHO, hindi ako familiar sa mga policies nila na ilang beses nang nagbago base sa mga memo's na narereceive ko sa email. Hindi pa naman ako entitled sa mga leaves ko keri.   


WALA DIN AKONG PROCESS TRAINING. Naintindihan ko yung expectation sakin nung ininterview ako. Tinanggap ko yung challenge. Ang hindi ko inexpect ee isasalpak ako sa trabaho na wala akong idea kung pano gawin. Oo, I have the skills and experience since I came from the same industry, pero magkakaiba ang process ng bawat company ee, iba iba din yung best practice. Entirely different business din tong pinasukan ko ang well aware yung employer ko sa nature ng product nung dati kong employer.   


1st week, papunta punta ako onsite na walang ginagawa, walang scheduled training, pero tinatanon ako ng manager anong ginagawa ko.??? Come 3rd day nung 1st week ko, nagtanong nako anong plans for me, training sched kung pwede paki block sa calendar ko para alam ko ieexpect. They proudly responded to me ""walang training plans."" 

2nd week, siguro dahil na din sa initiation ko, nagkaron bigla ng plans. Ok may idea nako sa overview. Pero tools, reporting, and jargon wala pa rin. Naging patient pa din ako. 

3rd week, di natuloy yung scheduled training, ipinasok ako sa ibang training na wala naman kinalaman sa role ko. Sa loob loob ko, sige na lang kesa wala akong gawin. 2 days lang yon. After nung 2 days training ulit, pero same lang sa training ko nung 2nd week. 

4th week, nag iimerse nako sa production, nagkipagkilala nako sa teammates bilang nag iisang new hire, dito pinilit ko nalang isipin na baka mas matuto ako pag ginagawa ko na yung mismong work. May natutunan naman ako, nalaman ko na pasikot sikot ng tools. Kaso may kulang pa din, hindi ko pa din talaga alam pano iprocess yung ibang request. Ang naiipprocess ko lang kasi lagi corrections. By the way walang proper delegation yung projects. Kung sino lang maisipang pagbigyan yun yung bibigyan ng task. Walang ownership from start to finish sa projects. Pwedeng ikaw magsisimula, pero iba ang tatapos ganon.   


Ayon nag 2nd month na ko't lahat ganyan pa din scenario. Not everyone was willing to help a newbie. Bad case pa sakin kasi expected to take a higher responsibility ako bilang co-lead. Another bad case is yung team lead namin walang alam sa process, so how am I gonna take a higher responsibility when my TL can't, si utos lang siya. and ako as co-lead will take instructions from the lead. Andami kong suggestions how to better implement changes and processes, pero it's falling on deaf ears because it will incur costs.   


This gets worse. Wala pa yung environment and gist of the kind of leadership pa lang yan nashare ko. Reklamador ba ko? Siguro. I can adjust sa process and best practices, matagal na ko sa corporate industry to not to know ang mga standard na kalakaran. Pero ang lala ng culture shock ko.

767,"Ang Kwento Ng Nag-Resign, Pumalit Sa Nag-Resign, at Napag-Iwanan Ng Trabaho. Bow!","Unahan ko na agad. **RANT** 'to! Pero idadaan ko sa kwento para may thrill.

Si **Nag-resign,** bale last day niya January 15 (sinadya talaga for cut-off para buong sweldo backpay). But prior to that, dumating na yung kapalitan niya January 4. Kaya hetong si **Nag-Resign**, siyempre you know the drill, nagtu-turn over siya rito kay **Pumalit** sa kanya. Beterano itong si **Nag-Resign** kaya nakakapagtakang aalis siya, lagpas dekada na siya sa company. But even though ganu'n, ang dami niyang hindi naasikaso or mga pending task na umabot na ng taon dahil may nakalagay na 2022 pa sa turnover files niya. Medyo nakakainis lang kasi sa tagal niya, umabot siya sa ganu'n na hindi niya talaga inasikaso na.

Si **Pumalit Sa Nag-Resign**, pumasok siya January 4. So far, so good. Ang swerte niya kung tutuusin, bagay na hindi niya alam kasi maraming nakaabang sa kanya ng pera. By the way, yung mga pending task na tinutukoy ni **Nag-Resign** pera 'yon para sa **Pumalit Sa Nag-Resign**, alam ko napaliwanag sa kanya, pero ewan ko ba. Nakakwentuhan ko pa si **Pumalit Sa Nag-Resign**, kasama mag-coffee break, kwentuhan, binibigyan ko ng tips. Sinabi ko yung cons sa work, pero sobrang shallow lang talaga. Tsaka para sa kanya, ""Wala lang daw 'yon. Sanay na siya. Dine-deadma lang niya."" Basically, hindi niya masyadong dinadamdam yung cons na sinabi ko base sa mga sagot niya rin sa kwentuhan.

Lumilipas ang panahon, siyempre ayon na nga, tinuturuan ni **Nag-Resign** si **Pumalit Sa Nag-Resign**. Naririnig at nakikita namin kung paano niya turuan, okay naman talaga. Even Manager, Boss and Colleagues, which is kami 'yon, tinatanong namin siya na kung may tanong siya at concerns, huwag siya mahiya. Kasi hindi naman sarado mga utak namin knowing si **Nag-Resign** at mga pending tasks niya.

Wala na si **Nag-Resign** by Tuesday kasi nga hanggang January 15 lang siya. Kaya naman si **Pumalit Sa Nag-Resign** totoong trabaho na talaga. Pero ito na nga ang **plot twist**, si **Pumalit Sa Nag-Resign** by Thursday, 3rd day simula nung umalis na si **Nag-Resign** biglang nagpasa na rin ng **Resignation**. Sobrang daming nainis kasi ang daming sinayang at ang dami niyang inabala. Each Department Assistant Head, in-orient siya, siyempre kumain ng oras 'yon. Yung mga Manager na sobra kung mag-orient which I should know kasi naranasan ko kung paano sila mag-orient, ang sobrang okay talaga.

Tapos biglang umalis? Alam mo kung ano yung nakakainis? Yung ang dami niya pang ebas nung nakakakwentuhan ko pa siya, tapos malaman-laman pa namin, nagde-demand siya ng ibang gawain, gusto niya yung gawain ng isa niyang kasabayan na bago, kung pwede palit daw sila, yung wala ka pa nga napapatunayan, pero kung makapag-demand ka sa gusto mo maging trabaho mo. Naiinggit siya kasi yung isang kasabayan niya, wala masyadong ginagawa pero kasi wala naman din tasks du'n at walang kita rin du'n, basically I am talking incentives and/or commission here. Kaya nga sabi ko, ang swerte niya kung tutuusin. Para siyang yung mga fresh graduate na ang demanding, wala pa naman napapatunayan, resign agad, ina-anxiety, ganito, ganyan.

So, ito na nga, Friday na. January 19. Galit na galit mga Manager namin, nagra-rant na sa area dahil sa istorbong ginawa niya na sana nung nakikita na niyang tinuturuan pa lang siya ni **Nag-Resign** at nakikita niya yung sandamakmak na pending tasks nito, sumuko na siya. Nakailang tanong kasi sa kanya, kasi ganu'n talaga sa mga bago at sobrang open ng boss namin sa concerns, kasi naramdaman ko siya nung bago ako, sinasabi ko talaga napapansin ko at mga concern ko agad bilang baguhan nu'n. Anyway, ayon na nga, Friday January 19. Ito na yung **shocking twist**. Hindi na tatanggap ng new employee as replacement ni **Nag-Resign** at **Pumalit Sa Nag-Resign**. Kaya naman, yung pending task nilang dalawa, hinati sa mga kasama nila at kabilang ako, si **Napag-iwanan Ng Trabaho.**

Sa totoo lang, wala naman sanang kaso talaga. Ang problem kasi, wala siyang proper turnover. Imagine, nasa pag-a-adapt pa lang si **Pumalit Sa Nag-Resign**, obviously hindi niya pa gamay, in fact, hindi niya nga na-gets pala yung mga tinuro ni **Nag-Resign** sa kanya, nung Thursday lang din namin nalaman, kaya nga siya nag-resign kasi hindi niya na-gets din.

769,Getting tired of sassy useless nepotism hire and unpaid OT pays.,"Sorry sa mahabaang rant T\_T  
For context, I work in a warehouse that houses parts boxes and newly produced parts for printers. Wala kaming pasok sana kahapon dahil may fiesta pero pinapasok ako para ayusin ang isang area. No problem, pasok = pera. Pagdating ko sa trabaho, may narinig ako na may nagsabi ""Bakit ayaw magtanong kung may pasok."" Buti na lang at may nagsalita pabalik na pinapapasok nga kami. Naabutan ko pa na pa-out na yung NH. Ang NH na ito ay nandoon lang dahil ang kapatid niya ay nagtratrabaho sa molding company na pinagtratrabahuhan ng warehouse namin. Lagi siyang nakaub-ob at nagpapahinga kapag walang request habang ang mga lalaking warehouse staff ang nagsosort at nagtataas/nagbaba ng mga boxes para sa kanya. Kapag rush pa ang mga boxes na request, tinatapon niya lang sa gilid ang mga basura at ako din maglilinis. Sinisigurado ko na palaging maayos ang area ko at sorted out at naitaas bago ako mag-out. Talaga lang tambak ang area niya ng mga boxes dahil kahit magsort ay hindi niya na ginagawa kaya yung area na dapat sana ay nagagamit namin ay natambakan ng mga boxes. Kaya nga ako pinapasok para maclear namin ang area na iyon. Narinig ko na lang siya magsabi na ""Porket may atm ka na, 'di ka na magwawalis"". Nakakagalit. Tuwing nightshift, naglalakad lakad ako para antukin at nakikita ko area niya na makalat at hindi pa sorted habang siya nakaub-ob sa tabi. Tumahimik na lang ako at sa isip ko, ""Malaki ang sasahurin ko sa dami ng OT ko"".  


Guess what? Dumating ang payslip ko at sa 65 hours na OT ko (24 hours ang hindi pa nabayaran noong December 1-15 at 41 hours ang OT ko nitong January 1-15, pero technically 37 hours and 47 minutes dahil hindi pa inapprove ang 3 hours at may butal ako na 13 hours) ay 46 hours at 47 minutes lang ang naapprove sa akin. Parang akong masusuka. I've never had a panic attack in a long while. About 16 hours ang hindi nabayaran. Kulang na ako sa tulog na, for the first time in my life, nagkaka-eye bags na ako. Tapos hindi pa nababayaran ang OT? Nakausap ko ang kasama ko at simula nga daw mahire ang accounting na iyon, lagi daw may problema sa sahod. Bakit hindi nila ayusin at tingnan kung anong ginagawa ng Payroll Staff? Busy ba sila na hindi maayos ng maganda ang sahod?  


Nagrarant kasi ako dahil andaming chechebureche na kailangan pagdaanan tapos ganito nangyayari. May biometric kami. May payroll site na pinagfifile-an ng mga OT na kailangan pang i-approve ng Warehouse Manager. Tinatawag pa namin ang mismong payroll staff. TAPOS, DUMATING ANG SAHOD NA KULANG. May mga kasama ako na nagsasabi na malaki na nga iyon, 'wag ko na daw masyadong isipin at maihahabol pa. WTF? So, bigay na lang ng libreng manpower?!?  


Pasensiya na sa pagrarant pero talagang nakakapagod. Ang sabi nga ay isang strike na lang sa DOLE at mapapasara na ang warehouse na iyon.

1. He was asking for an email from his manager as a reference and his manager said “I don’t read emails I’m just copied in.” 
2. His colleague in a project went on a long leave (sabbatical daw) but did not do any proper turnover so sa kanya hinahanap lahat (eh bago lang sya).

so as the other staff checks my documents, the other lady told the 3 to 4 guys na they are scheduled for an interview next week so i was expecting na yun din sasabihin sa akin after i-check ang documents ko pero natapos na ang lahat, walang sinabi ng date ng job interview ko. what gives me more ick ay may namention yung other lady na ""sabihan ko na lang si 'SIR' na nagpasa na kayo"" so grabe napa sideeye talaga ako. 

both of us have Engineering degrees and unlicesed but if you will compare our job experience, i think i have way better experince naman. hindi sa pagbubuhat ng sarili kong bangko but i have a almost two years experince sa dalawang construction companies and a job experince sa isang environmental NGO na which is very suited for the job position by the way since the position i am applying for is agriculture-related and requires to immerse in the community. isang beses palang ako nagtake ng board kahit 2020 pa ako nag grad. reason: need talaga kumayod. last boards na nagfail ako ay i was so mentally unstable kasi 50/50 non ang medical condition ng father ko after ng accident. 

wala lang. i am just disappointed. i can def look for other job position but (1) nakakahinayang rin kasi yung sahod kasi di mo yun madaling mahanap sa mga private companies, (2) need ko din talaga ng pera since kailangan pampagamot ng father ko and (3) ilang katulad ko pa kaya ang hindi nabigyan ng chance sa isang job vacancy ng mga government offices  dahil sa padrino system. 

this is so frustrating. but i guess ganito talaga ang buhay. kailan kaya magbabago ang pinas.

The account itself ay madali sana. I've been part of the leadership team before with other companies, and I decided to stand-back due to personal reasons.

There's no platform to voice out your concerns and feedback. Ang masaklap pa diyan, your feedback isn't anonymous.  Merong monthly feedback na kailangan isubmit. If you give them a low, it'll prompt you to write something on what they can improve, ang problema lang, your name and Employee ID is visible to Senior Managers. Pupuntiryahin ka kapag nagbigay ka ng low score. HR is virtually non-existent. Hindi mo ramdam at laging papalit palit ang HR.

I worked for a government agency as a kob order for almost 6 years, job order ang position, regular work ang banat, for a really discounted salary compared to theirs. All that time, meron na akong csc prof eligibility. Every time may opening, apply, apply, almost always coming in 2nd or 3rd, sa ibang branch na inapplyan na priority ang JO nila, syempre absorption. Pero last year, i apply for this position na nag open sa branch namin, pero wala pa lahat. Everything pointed that I wouldn't get it, even ung mga ka trabaho ko ang immediate response is sige lang next time marami pa dyan. I lost to my officemate, who was already a regular employee. To be fair, I had my fair share of being unpleasant. Over the years tumaas ang absentism ko, when a dear family member died, I went to a deep depression that almost broke me and my family. Until now ang hirap mag hanap ng trabaho, I'm getting this response na dapat kasi hindi ka nag resign, accept na lang natin kahit di tayo ma regular basta may work. I just wanted recognition, appreciation and an opportunity to move my career. It was too much for me to take, I loved it there pero.. anyway I understand the stupidity of my actions. I wouldn't mind at all your negative comments. I just wanted the chance to take this off my chest without the thought na may makaka kilala and would forever look at me negatively.

797,Possible Scam Agencies,"Hello! I saw this reddit rant na sumikat sa FB na yung topic is about sa Okoy and thief na ka-workmate so I had the courage to also rant and ask you guys what I experienced.

Meron naba dito naka-experience ng pinagmedical ng agency and nagbigay ng assurance na sure na daw na matatanggap ka sa work or company kung saan ka nila ie-endorse so pinagmedical na nila which amounting to P1,020 pesos. Pinagpasa rin ng requirements and then finally nabigay mo na yung endorsement letter sa company tapos sasabihin sayo na tatawagan ka nalang daw after ma evaluate ng documents and resume mo. In the end hindi ka matatawagan so it means hindi ka natanggap. 

I feel like na-scam ako since hindi nila tinanggap yung medical ko na 3 months old and meron daw silang affiliated medical clinic kung saan doon lang magpapa-medical. Ang theory ko is may porsyento itong agency sa medical clinic kada magpapadala sila ng tao na magpapamedical kahit hindi naman matatanggap sa company in the end. I also talked to other applicants which is same kame ng nangyare after interview sa company, sinabi lang rin ng HR ng company is tatawagan nalang daw sila pero since hindi ako natawagan, I doubt na natawagan sila.

&#x200B;

This could be a scam, a big one since marami akong kasabay na magpamedical na galing rin sa agency na yun, I estimate atleast 30 plus people were there. Tapos P1000 plus yung bayad kada person. Of course I could be wrong so Im asking you fellow workers if nangyari naba to sa inyo because it feels so wrong to take advantage to people na naghahanap ng work para magkapera pero gumastos pang medical pero hindi naman nagkawork.

798,Pa-rant lang,"Shout out nga pala sa chief namin, na willing i-pahamak ang tao niya para lang maging malinis siya sa mukha ng pinaka-boss namin.

Nashow-cause order ng halos lahat sa departamento sa amin, dahil nahuli ng pinakaboss namin ung natutulog na empleyado, so akala namin siya lang, pocha halos 95% ng tao nabigyan ng show cause order, pero hindi na namin yon minamatter and dinidiin yung empleyado na iyon.

Nakalagay doon sa show cause order na NEGLECT OF DUTY kami, despite na may output naman kaming nilabas, so ung mga assistant boss namin, willing kaming tulungan sa department namin at nagpatawag ng mga meetings. Maraming beses kami nang mineeting pero etong dalawang meeting na ito ung tumatak talaga dahil sa kanya.

2nd meeting namin with the assistant boss, normal na usap lang na bakit ganon and explain naman kami na ginagawa naman po ung report namin, with matching evidence naman. (Tho isang specific duty lang naman pinakita and nakita, hindi pa kasama ung other scheduled duties) na walang nangyaring neglect of duty sa mga nadamay. 

After non, may inutos siya na, ikaw chief, may ganito naman palang problema, dapat tulungan mo ung tao mo, nirereport naman nila ung insidente sa iyo, bakit di nagagawan ng paraan? Ung ibang report, pa-generate naman. 

 ETO UNG LINYANG TUMATAK SA AMING LAHAT. 

""BAKIT AKO?""

Sinupalpal siya ng assistant boss na ANO BA? TAO MO YAN AH? TULUNGAN MO NAMAN YAN AT MGA NAKAYUKO NA.

""YES PO.""

Ginawa naman ung report, pero feel namin na napilitan lang siya sa pag-gawa non. After ginawa ung report. Except kay chief, sabay-sabay na kami na nagsubmit ng explanation sa Internal Department. Saktong dumaan ung lawyer doon na assistant boss din namin at may idea siya sa nangyari and kinausap kami ulit. Ginuide naman kami sa paano ung paglalagay sa Show Cause Order namin, and nagexplain naman kami kung ano ung nangyari and sabi niya, revise ninyo to, so okay lang naman yon para atleast mahelp kami. 

Habang nag-meeting kami, nag-submit na din pala siya ng response sa show-cause and pinatawag din siya. Tumabi siya sa akin and pinakinggan na ung mga sinabi namin.

Alam ninyo ung body movement niya na galaw ng galaw, hindi mapalagay, kinakamot ulo lagi like bruh ganyan ka pala and halos kinokontra lahat ng sinasabi nung lawyer.

Then sinabihan din siya na ikaw chief, tulungan mo sila sa pagrerevise kasi malalagot yang mga tao mo na yan. 

THEN GUESS WHAT, SHE SAID THE LINE AGAIN.

""BAKIT AKO?""

Kahit katabi ko boss ko, napatingin na lang ako sa isang katabi ko eh.

Hindi nagsalita ung lawyer sa kanya, nung nandon pa kami. Nagsalita siya nung pinadisperse kami at pinaiwan siya.

""Ano ka ba, ikaw ang boss ng mga ito, alam mo bang subject for dismissal yan mga yan tapos kinontra mo pa ako?""

Sabi nung chief namin: Joke lang po.

YEAH JOKE LANG PO. JOKE LANG NA MAWALAN KAYO NG 95% NA TAO? JOKE LANG DIN PALA NA NAGKAKAIYAKAN NA LAHAT DITO TAPOS JOKE PA DIN PALA?

804,Less than a month and gusto ng manager na alam ko na lahat,"Idk if it's her way to push me pero nakaka-offend na mga comments niya. Nagkaron kami ng meeting na hindi siya masaya sa performance ko. Hindi daw mataas na mark bibigay niya sa evaluation ko. Wag na daw ako magulat if bagsak ako. I'm doing the associate tasks at the same time ginagawa ko din yung tasks ko as a supervisor. Where I work, ako na top ng department namin. Lagi akong OT ng more or less 3 hours a day.

Nung tumutulong ako sa associate sasabihin sana nag-associate na lang ako. Unahin ko daw yung mga dapat kong gawin. Nung hindi ako tumulong sasabihin wala akong initiative. She even claimed na may nagsabi sa kanya na wala daw silang natutunan sakin. Pero lagi kong kinakamusta mga associates ko and kung may natutunan sila. Every duty ko yan tinatanong. Lagi ako nanghihingi ng feedback sa kanila tungkol sakin, sa performance ko, paano ko sila matutulungan. Nagbibigay naman sila ng feedback na ginagamit ko for the betterment ko and maging mas smooth yung flow ng department. Di ko alam kung saan niya hinuhugot yung mga ""sinabi"" daw sa kanya. Either my associates lie or gumagawa lang siya ng issue.

Pinagawa niya ako ng guidelines and procedure. Sabi daw sa kanya sinabi ko daw na aayusin ko muna yun bago ko ayusin yung department. I never said that. And why tf will I say that?

Sa interview, di ko minention ang condition ko dahil wala naman silang naitanong about that and I think, di naman necessary to know that kasi given na yung job description & nature of work, I know na I can do it naman. Rather than seeing my abilities and skills, naging hesitant sila ng dahil sa condition ko... it sucks... yess.. but by the end of the day- work is work and syempre as someone who goes to monthly therapy- i learned how to cope.

806,My mom is giving me the silent treatment and sinabing kinamumuhian ko daw paghiram niya sakin ng pera.,"My mom is a businesswoman and my pops a seafarer. I (F21) used to work with a monthly salary less than 20k. While I was working, she would constantly ask to borrow money from me and may pa ""ibibigay ko sayo agad bukas/this week"" siya. I would willingly let her even when I know she won't stick to her words. My salary money was used for many things like my rent, school, meals, etc. I was trying to be independent so she can use my dad's allotment for my siblings. This went on for months and even prior to only having school allowance pa from my papa, she'd also borrow my money. I know some of her money problems. Loans everywhere and at least 2 demand letters I've seen. I was also publicly shamed by a former friend on fb kase may utang daw mama ko sa mama niya and I didn't know about this utang. Her loans? My dad is unaware.

So last week, she borrowed some of my allowance given by my pops and again, said she'd return it the next day. Ending is, she still hasn't. And earlier this day she talked me into asking for more allowance from my pops kase di pa daw nya ma-reimburse yung pera kong hiniram nya. I said ""no"". Context is, I'll be using that allowance this week na. Then, we had a conversation about salaries and she told me this: ""dapat lang magpahiram ka sakin ng pera mo kase pinapahiram kita pag ikaw yung walang pera"".  

Isn't it valid to feel disappointed, hurt, and annoyed at the same time? How would you reply to her if it were u in my shoes? 

I replied about how my then salary was barely enough and how she'd always call me days prior to borrowing my money shouldn't be her thing. I made it a point that she's expecting too much from me already, how much more if when I finally have the right career? She got mad and also said ""sge di na ako manghihiram sayo nang pera, kino-compare mo ko sa ibang nagtatrabaho na mga kapatid lang ginagastusan pero ikaw yung mama mo naman ang nanghihiram"". And then gave me the silent treatment. My mind just went blank for seconds. Has she not realized that she's also treating me like her ""arawan"" loans na pwede lang din kung bukas na yung collection (!??). 

The thing is she doesn't understand how this negatively affects me. I have bigger dreams like studying abroad. But I always get stuck din in between her problems. And shouldn't major money talk be for adults? I think pops finally needs to know of her problems. I DO want to give back to my parents when the time comes but now parang ayaw ko na. I'm thinking na it'd be better to lie to her about my money. I can no longer think of how to deal with her or even make her understand kase di naman siya nakikinig when I try to make a point. How do I set clear boundaries?

808,"Accused, yet eventually pursued to be the other woman of a high ranking officer","I, F26, is accused of being the other woman of a high ranking officer. Nakakanginig yung part na this rumor is spreading like a wild fire burning me to ashes. 

This all started when I got the regularly position, and had particularly special treatments from our boss. Automatically when I joined their office, I got privileges (I admit) and doing his dirty works. He invites me with almost all his whereabouts. As a newbie to their office I have no choice but to affirm kasi work-related naman - as of my perspective.

I NEVER ASKED EVEN A SINGLE ONE OF THOSE.

I've been working really hard since my first day of work as a contractual in other office connected to the boss I mentioned above. That, paved my way on getting my regularization.

Yet, because of how that boss treat me in the office, rumors began to swarm about us having a relationship. Gossips then reached to our boss' end and he provocatively announced during our meeting that all rumors are false and I am just competent worker the office needed most.

Here's the catch.

He became more and more stingy towards me. He even invited me personally going out, the first time he did this I was shocked that we were alone - I just let it slip out kasi wala talagang malice sa akin this is all just part of the work, I supposed.

I realized that everything was wrong when he asked me about my lovelife. Upon confirming my status as single, it must have became his affirmation of my availability to be his. Yuck. He  begun saying delusional things as if he is my boyfriend.

RIGHT THERE AND THEN, HE CONFESSED THAT HE LIKES ME AND WANTS US TO BE REAL 🤢

That became a trauma. I cried for several hours, asked my friends for advices. I then decided to ask for help from my previous boss.

I cried my heart out in front of her and asked for help. She was furious of course and took the concern personally with my boss at that time. After days, I was transferred back to my previous office. 

I thought the storm was over, until two weeks ago. He demanded me to return to his office as his executive secretary. He said that he will publish an official order for this matter. My now-boss still defended me and made sure I will be in a safe working space. An Official Order was published last monday confirming that I'll still remain with my now-boss' team.

655,"Ako yung na agrabyado, pero ako yung nalagay sa PIP","Mag-oone year anniversary na pala to sa work ko and I don't know how I've made it this long.

Just this month I was put on PIP for not being ""culturally fit"" sa office namin, yung reason? Ginrey-rock ko yung ex HR representative namin.

Context lang about me, I'm one of the youngest members of the company and nasa at least 4 years yung gap naming with our older co-workers. Basically my co-workers are all in their early to mid 30s. Maliit lang company namin, but this isn't my first company but this is one of the first companies where I felt very comfortable with the work and environment.

We're very lean din sa company namin, for the PH team 9 lang kami lahat. 

It all started when I developed a friendship with one of the managers from a different department. Now we don't exactly work in the same department so wala talagang kinalaman ang work with how we became friends. It just turned out one day that she liked hanging out with me and we listen to a lot of similar music - we got even closer when I offered to help her get tickets to one concert she wanted to go do bad pero conflict siya with a work-trip. I had the connections and di naman ako madamot so I secured them for her and she was thankful. Ever since then, we'd get into conversations about concerts, music fests, travel, the like. Yan lang kasi escape ko from all the stresses of work, yan lang din reason why I work hard to be able to afford those.

Now comes the trouble, si close friend M ko sa office, is also best friends with the HR representative ng company. Siya yung nagpapasok and they go way back, even being co workers in a previous job once before our company now.

Before I would even feel like I'm intruding in their friendship when close friend would ask me to go with them both to buy office supplies, or run errands for the company during weekends. Again, I'm a homebody and going out sometimes would do my mental health good. Okay naman yung dynamic at first, kaso I just noticed na parang, close friend (36) gets treated badly by HR representative (33).

Me (25) minding my own business, kept that observation to myself kasi at the end of the day, wala naman akong say sa friendship nila. If time yung basehan, they're probably tighter than me and my close friend kasi they've been friends for longer, pero that doesn't really mean anything to me.

3 months into my employment sa company, I also found one of my close friends lets name her B needing work, and I'm the type to help out whenever I can. So I put in a good work, and thankfully si B napasok. Take note around this time okay pa kami. Super solid naming ng ex-best friend ko, she's 4 years older than me so I respect her the way I would my elders. Close friend M even encouraged me to put in the good word because she says she trusts me with whoever I vouch for especially since B will be working under her in case ma-hire siya. 

And B did get hired, she would work under close friend M, and I'd be drowning in work from my department while also training B while I offload some of my responsibilities to her at the request of the company to make me focus on other things.

Around this time din I found myself having to hold back on company gatherings (may weekly dinners kasi kami every wednesday) because my papa got diagnosed with cancer, and my mental health was very bad due to overworking myself.

One day though, pinagalitan ako ng boss ko, which is the co-founder, because may nagkamali with handling a client, and sadly it was B. Of course, best friend ko si B dun so I tried my best para i-cushion yung galit ng boss ko and para naman di siya mapagalitan. I made sure close friend M knew so she can also help me out as B is directly under her naman.

Both close friend M and I spent a good 4 hours solving the problem, and di man lang nag reply si B sa amin. 

Hours later (after the shift, so weekend na) nakita ko nalang si B na nagsusubtweet ng masasamang words (;\~:) pertaining to me about work and even saying I'm using my mental health as an excuse. 

Why she was attacking me? I don't know. I was too busy hours before that cleaning up her mess.

I told close friend M about it and she was just confused as I was where all this hostility was coming from, especially when close friend M and I have been cleaning up after friend B ever since she got into the company.

The kicker here is si friend B has always confided to me about having post partum, the reason why I wanted her to get into our company so bad because the pay was significantly higher than her old company, plus this would greatly help her pay off her bills. I rarely indulge her when she confides in me about her marital trouble because i'm honestly not a good fit to give her advice on that, I just make sure to let her know na people are not her enemy, her partner is not her enemy, and she should give them the chance.

Ang sad lang kasi she never gave me the chance and immediately assumed I was mad at her for having to pick up after friend B at work, when really I was just working on autopilot with all the heavy baggage I was already carrying on my own. Besides, post partum is a lot, I could go longer not letting her know about my dad's diagnosis, or my own head going to shit.

Pero turns out, friend B and HR representative has already been harboring ill-will towards me. A few more months after that incident, friend B has been making it harder for me to do my work. So one day I snapped, everything got to me.

And this got the attention of our management and our US team. 

I'm not one to complain pero I've had enough. We got a mediation meeting happen, umiyak si friend B in front of me accusing me of making her feel like she was indebted to me when all the time she was in the company, I've been focusing on my work and helping clean up whatever work she messed up just so our Co-founder wouldn't get mad at her even further. During that mediation though, it was clear that HR representative was very biased towards friend B in the process, and management even found more instances where HR representative was breaking company protoc

This lead to her and friend B being put under PIP and me let off with a warning for acting unbecoming of myself at work.

After that I simply grey rocked them both. 

I simply cut off my friendship with B, a 4 year friendship down the drain. We were so close that I even let her stay for weeks in my apartment when she and her family would fight. So close that I missed a day of work because I ran around town buying them groceries and medicine when I found out their house got cordoned after she got COVID during the pandemic. I couldn't handle the disrespect.

The worst thing about this all is si HR Representative pa ang galit sa akin? Why? We don't know. 

Feel ko mas nagagalit siya when I grey rock her. When I stay out of her way. Do whatever she says. Be the bigger person and just not give in to her taunts.

She's come to a point na even when friend B was already let go of the company, she would stoop so low as to rally all the new hires against me before even getting to know me.

Sobrang petty din niya, I got hospitalized for a week nung November for dengue, and lets be honest my mental health probably made it even worse, I barely get hospitalized. Our management was so worried and tasked her to send fruits my way, but when she found out that close friend M has been dropping by to see me after work, walang dumating. Kahit apple juice.

Now to the PIP part, aware naman yung management na ganun yung treatment nya sa akin. Just this December pinag WFH ako indefinitely to somehow protect me from the hostility of the situation, work no longer felt safe for me, and I'm p sure bumaba ang performance ko with the treatment I've been getting at work. Yung US team nalang talaga yung nagtetreat sakin as human, as well as close friend M,and yung country manager namin.

The higher ups think it's because HR rep is jealous of my friendship with close friend M, but i don't get that.

I'm not the one who forces close friend M to hang out with me, she just wants to and di naman ako tumatanggi if it means I get to go out of the house. We've even invited her out to join us before until she stopped coming on her own accord.

&#x200B;

I just feel like it's very unfair na I'm under PIP for basically being bullied at work. I never confront them because they're all older than me by significant years, ayoko di naman ng gulo.

&#x200B;

What's more unfair is ang dami ko pang opportunities sa company and HR representative is just paying off debt she owes to the company before resigning. I have so much to lose while she doesn't.

&#x200B;

Yan lang hahahah idk where I'm going with this, unfair na I was handed a PIP when the only memo I've ever earned in my whole career is for losing an office key 5 years ago in my old company.",1,3,0.56,True,Rant 😡,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/19eod4a/ako_yung_na_agrabyado_pero_ako_yung_nalagay_sa_pip/,2024-01-25 03:07:01,19eod4a

657,Power trip?,"I am new to the company and working as marketing sa isang retail sa pasig, may pinalitan akong empleyado at siya ang magiging manager ng team. Konting background lang, galing ako sa BPO and pinursigi ko makagraduate para mapursue ko yung gusto kong trabaho which is kung nasaan ako ngayon.

Ang problema ngayon nung 1 buwan pa lang ako wala halos akong ginagawa at di niya ako tinuruan sa mga dapat gawin at shes acting na alam ko everything, ang pagkakasabe saken ng HR bago ako mahire meron daw akong 6 months training pero kabaliktaran wala talaga, ang tanging ginagawa ko nalaamang is mag adapt sa mga ginagawa ng mga ka team ko at nagtatanong.

Puro din siya parinig na “ dpat yung mapapasahan ng trabaho ko dedicated” habang may ibang mga tao at may nakkakarinig sa kanya, ako lang naman ang tanging sasalo ng dati nyang trabaho pero di ko maintindihan bakit di nya ako mapagkatiwalaan o mabigyan ng chance.

Fast forward, may mga project ako ngayon at halos lahat ako lang gumawa at minsan lang ako magtanong dahil minsan makikita mo sa facial expressions nya/at ng mga kateam ko na ayaw maobliga na magturo sa baguhan.

So eto yung naging problem recently, bagong taon na bagong taon. Habang bumabyahe ako pauwi naka receive ako ng viber message sa kanya.

 “ ____ and to your friends, not sure of what you did but it was brought to my attention.

Next time guys you want to drink during office hours, please drink responsibly. Either pigil muna and do it pag uwi or make it discreet, umiwas kayo sa nakakakita. I'm very considerate but not to this extent please. Thank you. 

Yun lang, ingat kayo pag uwi.”

Like wtf?! Inisip ko talagang mabuti and imposibleng uminom kami ng mga kaibigan ko during work hours or break time, hanggang sa nag rant ako sa kanya na san nanggaling ang chismis at may proweba ba? Hindi nya ako masagot sa mga sinasabi ko at ang sabi nalang niya 


“Alright ___, I know and believe you. I just told yung nag sabi na I have to check with you guys.

But sayo ko lang sinabi, hindi naman ako basta basta nagagalit sa ganito and just remind your friends. Thank you, ___!”

Ang masakit lang hindi niya muna tinanong sakin kung totoo ba sana manlang nag confirm bago siya mag conclude or maniwala na ako at ang mga kaibigan ko, imbis na may mahimbing kami na pahinga ng sat and sun 2 araw tuloy kami nagiisip kung san niya kinuha.

Pinaabot ko to sa pinaka boss naming lahat, kahit sya nagulat sa nangyari at siya daw mag aasikaso to fix this, umiyak na rin ako sa kanya sa kadahilanang di ko ineexpect na mangyyare sakin ito.

Monday, nagkita kita ang lahat at pinatawag ako ng manager ko at magusap daw kami, ang statement niya saken “bakit umabot sa pinakaboss namin at san daw nanggaling ang galit ko”, di ko maintindihan bakit muka pa akong masama? Hindi ko inaaccept mga reason niya dahil ginagaslight niya ako at nangangatwiran, humingi siya ng dispensa dahil napagalaman nga namin na hindi kami ito.

Ngayon, ang hirap kumilos lalo na pag magkakateam kayo. Halos nalalate ako araw araw dahil di na ako motivated wala na rin akong trust sa kanya. 

May mga iilan pang issue na di ko nabanggit, nakakapagod sa totoo lang. 

Do you think maghanap ako ng ibang opportunity?

659,client wants to hire me directly,"H! Need help.

I am currently under a VA agency which pays less than 20k per month pero less than 2k USD binabayad ng client (yes, ang lala). I was starting palang sa industry so I nigrab ko na for experience and sa skills and knowledge na maacquire ko.

During our daily meeting, tinanong niya ako if recorded daw ba yung meeting, sabi ko hindi. Then sabi niya he wants to hire me directly kasi magkakaroon daw siya ng business partner at ayun daw mas kaya magbayad sa akin, at di daw nila need ng 40 hours per week, kahit 10 lang. Ofcourse gusto ko. And dahil sa bugso ng damdamin, naopen ko nga yung about sa salary ko (hindi ko exact sinabi na 20k lang pero mali pa rin kasi it was stated sa contract na confidential) and told him na I am planning to leave the company. Sabi niya bakit daw ganoon yung agency, etc.

Kinabukasan, he asked for my personal email address para daw dun namin pagusapan. He seemed serious dun sa offer niya. I told him na binasa ko yung contract at may non-solicitation clause which bawal magwork sa client w/in 2 years of leaving the agency. I asked him kung may non-compete clause sa contract nila and he said yes. Then I told him na the offer is great (we haven't discussed about the salary if ever), and we can do it if we can both compromise and keep it  to which he agreed. Sabi niya pa marami daw siya kakilala na pwede niyang ioffer sa akin as client.

My questions are:
  1.  Should I go for it? If yes, siya ba gagawa nung contract or ako? Can I request for additional clause lalo na yung confidentiality? Kaso nabanggit niya to a business partner niya bago niya pa iopen sa akin yung offer.
  2.  Ano po dapat ko gawin para di mahuli? Mauna magresign bago matapos contract nila ni agency? Or magtanggap lang ng client na bigay ni agency and sideline lang si current client? Then tsaka ko na tatanggapib yung ioffer niyang ibang clients?
  3.  Is $5 per hour okay? Mali din kasi ako na sinabi kong 1/4 lang nakukuha ko sa payment niya sa agency so nakita ko na nicompute niya at baka dun niya pa ibase yung salary ko. Wala siyang sinabi na tatapatan niya or what. Tinanong niya lang ako but since I don't have any idea, wala akong sinabi.
  4.  May tracking system yung agency (activtrak). Kung gagawa ba ako ng tasks sa ibang user account but same device, matatrack pa rin?

Di ko gamit main ko kasi same sya ng main kong username na gnagamit hahaha and i'm using mobile to type so sorry po sa mga typos if there's any.

Nagwork ako sa isang company na to last 2017 to 2019ish. Maayos naman ang pakikitungo saken ng company na yun. In fact, binigyan nila ako ng choice para wag na lang mag resign instead long vaca na lang instead na paid pero di ako pumayag. Pagod na kasi ako and may nangyayare kasi sa personal life ko kaya gusto ko na lang lumayas for good. I render for good 30 days and umalis with COE and complete docs. Maayos sila kausap so I thought wala kami problema.

Supposedly mag migrate ako somewhere pero I decided not to na lang sfter a couple of months and apply again somewhere pero di malapit sa vicinity nila. Mas malapit sa lugar ko... tapos nagulat ako tinawagan ako ng HR kasi nag background check sila saying na ""Im not for rehire"" and pinapatanong nila nalit ganon nnagyare? Kahit ako nalito bakit? I know umalis ako ng walang problema. Nagkarooj ako ng COE and nakalagay dun wala ako problema tapos nung tumawag sila sa company biglang bago ihip ng hangin?? Sobrang nalito ako na ewan and na disappoint. Parang na betray ako na ewan. Like... siguro nabetray din sila na ewan saken kasi nag work ulit ako pero di na sa kanila after a few months pero its not really what I planned naman and dapat talaga mag migrate ako.. kailangan ko ba mag paliwanag sa kanila about dun? Im so confused really.

Muntikan na ako di makapasok dun sa company na un dahil dun sa not for rehire na sabi nila na un.

Anyways, it's been years and gusto ko lang sya ilabas. Ayaw ko na mag work ulit dun dahil sa nangyare kasi feeling ko sobrang petty nya na ewan. Originally nung nag resign ako dapat wala na akong kahit anong gagawin dun sa company kasi wala na ako obligasyon pero parang ganun yung nalabas nung sinabi nila yun sa HR ng company na pinag applyan ko nun.

I have been working in a mid-sized company for 4 months now and was a fresh grad last year with Latin honors I took this job just for experience while waiting for a bigger offer from a prestigious hotel since it is really hard to land a job you know the Philippines has high standard. As I observe myself I see no progress in my tasks because mostly encoding of sales invoices and other clerical tasks as well as nagfefacebook me and watch dramas because wla n rin gagawin. I know I should be grateful for having a job but it's a minimum wage and 2 hrs ung travel ko from house to work naguguilty rin me ksi sasahod ako with small accomplishments tas wla pangb natitira  but at least positive ung work environment hehe but I don't really see my growth and future here ksi knti lng rin tlaga kmi n employees and mtaas pangarap ko ksi and hrap maging mhrap ka

the other side of this story is I already lose hope to be part of the hospitality industry n malayong malayo s tinapusan ko n management. but my prayers ended up calling me to have another interview but in a different department kinakbahan ako ksi I need to prepare cause maybe this is my last chance  ganito pala kahirap s real world lol. finding your purpose khit di mo alam ano b tlga gsto mo

the question is it worth to take risk? i know in the end desisyn ko pa rin to but time flies so fast  to the point di ko mashare s fam ko ksi wla n rin ung mom ko but the point is mas mataas ung sahod, more benefits, free meal and mas kilala ung company kesa s current ko pero ung position is under wardrobe (I think its great also for my future to work abroad related s hospitality)  but I read it somewhere to take any job until you find your dream job because pride won't help you to eat something nice

664,"Puro God card ang ginagamit pero mostly naninigaw and nagcucurse na boss, normal ba?","Mayroon akong naging experience na boss sa dati kong pinagtatrabahuan. Wala naman akong naging problema sa mga katrabaho ko kasi mababait at sobrang good vibes sila. Pero iba ang kwento pagdating sa boss namin. Sya actually ang may-ari ng kumpanya kaya sya yung may boses talaga sa lahat. Ang siste, pati sa pinakamaliit na detalye ng trabaho, pinapakialaman nya to the point na nalilihis na yung mga deliverables sa project. IT and Business Consulting nga pala ang nature ng work namin doon at nag-ooffer ng custom-fit na system sa mga companies. Ang kalakaran, pag hindi ka nag-OT, tamad ka at ayaw mong pagsilbihan si God. Wag daw masyadong magwork para sa pera kaya hindi sila nagbabayad ng OT simula nung pumutok ang covid hanggang ngayon na lahat na ng kumpanya ay nagsisimula nang makabawi. Hindi naman sila actually nahirapan lahit during covid kasi IT nga ang business. Pwedeng magwork kahit saan basta may internet. Ang naging downside lang, kailangan nasa google meet or zoom ka buong araw, minsan magdamag pa dahil kailangan magwork kasama ng boss. Kami na empleyado, need magstart magtrabaho ng umaga pero kailangan namin hintayin ang boss namin na gabi pa umaattend ng meetings. Ang masaklap, hindi pwedeng tumanggi sa extended working hours kasi nga, magagalit si God at kailangan daw namin magwork para sa kanya. Imagine yung ginagawa niyang gaslighting para lang abusuhin mga tao? Okay lang naman din na magtrabaho nang more than 8 hours pero hindi araw-araw. 6x a week. Ang masama pa, pinag-OT ka na na walang bayad, makakarinig ka pa ng mga mura at paninigaw galing sa kanya. If words can kill, siguro namurder na kami. Ganyan kalala. Kaya nga kahit na nasa kasagsagan ng pandemic, hindi na ako nagdalawang isip na magresign. Kesehodang mahirap maghanap ng trabaho. Okay lang. Basta makaalis lang sa kumpanya na walang pagpapahalaga sa mga tao at tanging pera lang ang iniisip. Sobrang supportive ko dati sa vision ng company kaso sobrang lala na ang ugali ng boss. Mas mabuti pa talagang iwanan sila. Plus, yung sales pitch nila, sobrang layo na sa katotohanan. Halos “lokohin” na nila prospect clients nila kasi nagbebenta sila ng products na wala silang expertise. Kukuhanan lang nila ng idea ang clients instead na sila ang magturo. “Consultants” pa ang tingin nila sa mga sarili nila pero wala naman talaga silang alam. At sana, yung mga naiwan ay magkaroon din sila ng lakas ng loob na subukan ang buhay sa labas. Mas maraming opportunities at mas maraming companies na pwedeng magpahalaga sa kung anong kaya nating maioffer sa kanila.

665,Healthcare Worker ng Zamboanga del Norte 10 months na walang sahod??,"context: Taken from an FB Page. The OP of the ss below is a worker from a hospital of Zamboanga del Norte

Translated as: ""Good morning maam/sir. Gusto ko lang ishare dito ang problema ko na walang sweldo sa Zanorte hospital (short for Zamboanga del Norte Medical Center). Nagtrabaho ako sa ZNMC for 1 year and 5 months pero nagresign ako noong December
2023. First 9 months sa trabaho, ok naman ang sahuran kahit delay ng 2-3 months, matitiis ko pa kase alam kong ganyan talaga ka delay ang sahuran ng Job Order sa govt. Pero after that, hanggang ngayon di ko pa natanggap ang April to November 2023 na sahod like
it's been 10 months na grabe naman jusko pati pasko at new year wala akong maibigay na panghanda sa pamilya ko. Mas kawawa pa yung iba na nagpatuloy pa sa trabaho nagtitiis na walang natanggap na sweldo. 0o kasalanan ko rin na nagtiwala ako sa gobyerno na mag-antay lang pero it's been 10 MONTHS asan na yung
mga pinangako niyo?? Natrigger ako nung nagfollow-up na ako sa capitol, pinapasa2x ako sa kung kani-kanino tapos sinabihan pa kami na hindi kami mabigyan ng April, May, June na sahod dahil wala kaming Job Order contract kase wala pang budget. Dagdag pa nila, hindi na
talaga kami mabigyan ng sahod kase close na ang 2023 at tapos na yearly obligation. Like WTF?? Kung hindi man kami mabigyan ng sahod ngayong Feb, magkita na lang tayo sa Tulfo. Sa mga mah ganitong sitwasyon, PM kayo sa akin because if we are not going to voice out, paikot
ikutin lang tayo at idadaan sa matamis na salita. Numero uno pa sa plataporma nila ang healthcare workers tapos ano na?? Blood and sweat ang binuhos namin
sa pagttrabaho namin sa ospital tapos depression and anxiety and sinukli nila. Hindi nla ba nakkita sitwasyon namin? I know ang iba ok lang matagal mabigyan ng sahod pero sa akin hindi kase ako ang bumubuhay sa aking pamilya. I know common practice po ang delay na
sahod pero 10 F**KING MONTHS ay di na po tama yon! If di nila mabigyan ang april, may, at june, harap na lang tayo sa Tulfo or sa Ombudsman. I hope ma post mo to
admin pakitago na lang ang name saka pic thank you very much.'


TLDR: isang healthcare worker ng Zamboanga del Norte medical center Job order under province of zamboanga del norte ang hindi nabigyan ng sahod ng sampung
buwan. Imagine 10 MONTHS NA WALANG SAHOD?? What kind of quackery did the government do?? Seriously nakakahiya yan sa office nila if ever totoo. I wonder bakit hindi ito nabalita sa national TV. Ganito na ba ang
pilipinas ngayon? I pray for kababayan for justice and his/her timely situation. As an OFW nurse, kaya nga ako umalis sa bansa dahil sa ganitong kalakaran ng sistema.I ddnt expect na 2024 na may ganito pa rin.

672,Any affordable mental health services in the metro for a BPO employee?,"Been with this employer for a year and 3 weeks now, but I switched managers right after my regularization last year because she moved to a different company. I admit I've had several hiccups performing this role because...

I work for 2 different employers full-time simultaneously. (Shocking I know, but in this economy with zero support from anyone, it's necessary.) I've been at Job 1 since 2019, but because of the pandemic, I had to take on another one. Kept switching the second hustle around til I finally landed on Job 2 in 2022. Thought I could handle both just fine since the work's remote, but I think I'm teetering to the edge.

Because of aforementioned hiccups, I've been put on a month-long PIP at Job 2 right after I hit my first anniversary, and to be frank, I'm losing my mind over it. I feel like I'm performing even worse than ever because of the added monitoring. I'm struggling to keep my focus because I now feel like nothing I do is right. 

I can't admit to my manager that I dwell on my past mistakes, overthink everything, and think that every week that we have our 1-on-1, I feel my mind shutting down because I fear he'll point out a mistake that my overthinking brain missed. I can't tell anyone here that I two-time either because I need both incomes to support myself.

I can't give up my messed-up career now, but I doubt I can find any better because I didn't finish college (unrelated). So I'll have to stick with what I got. I know I'm good at what I do; I just can't keep up the professional sanity to continue this bit anymore.

I know that for now, I just need a good sit-down therapy session, so where can I find one here? Can anyone recommend a place or a therapist I can reach out to?

The problem: they ignoring my request to improve my skills, they bench me but because I work fast they tend to see my hours as undertime. I tried telling them I want to move to development team again so I can code but they refuse and want me to do the same all around task (coding, database, deployment, qa, customer support). Anything Jira throws me I will do it

More problem: the company is starting to be very political. The management is trying to downplay 10 completed task per day but only required me 3 hours to finish it. They want me to log 8 hours and stuff but they gonna say “how you justify this hours blah blah blah”. They don’t want me to improve my skills or undergo bootcamps while others are allowed due to their role (kissing ass to this one control freak manager)

I am very active in my role because I was kinda in the support team at first, and I do help a lot of the newbies in their task when they feel lost, so it was not my nature to be this chill and benched, and always on the look to help colleagues.

676,Pinagkukumpisal ako ng employer ko,"Pinakakumpisal ako ng employer ko

Hi, (29F) i am currently a marketing employee sa isang company who owns a well-known facial clinic chain pero dun ako sa isang business nila nagwowork. 

So eto na nga, yung head ng planta let’s call her Maria… she’s been with the company ever since and parang right hand siya ni business owner. One time nag alok si Maria na pumunta kaming marketing team sa planta para makita daw namin process kung paano ginagawa product. So me and my team said yes and magseset daw siya ng date.

We’re waiting for Maria’s confirmation via text, email, or kahit call kaso wala kaming narecieve from her. Dumating yung time na nagka-tonsillitis ako ng malala and my doctor said na wag muna ako pumasok for 2 days so I messaged my manager informing her na ganito situation and they approved my leave. Suddenly Maria went to office nung day na naka-sick leave ako (day 1) para sunduin kami and pumunta sa sa planta.

During my sick leave (day 1), si manager lagi akong kinukulit about work na parang di ako nakaleave so i thought na pasok nalang ako kinabukasan even the doctor said na rest lang kasi nagwowork pa din ako. Tapos nagulat ako the next day, sinisigawan na ako ni Maria dahil hindi daw ako nagsabi sa kanya na wala ako nung day na susunduin niya ako. I was just quiet at the moment since I was taken aback from her reaction and masakit pa lalamunan ko. 

The next day, the president and his wife called me to his office. I knew na pagagalitan ako kasi sino ba kakampihan nila diba? Tapos they asked me questions like “may boyfriend ka ba? Pag nag aaway ba kayo ng boyfriend mo nagsosorry ka? Sa magulang mo ba nagsosorry ka?” Tapos biglang “hija katoliko ka ba? may bukas na simbahan diyan malapit sa office, mangumpisal ka para gumaan pakiramdam mo” pero hindi pa nagtatapos diyan THEY EVEN GAVE ME PRAYER BOOKLETS PARA DAW MAGDASAL AKO!

Idc if pagalitan nila ako if about work yun, pero para sabihan na mangumpisal and bigyan ako prayer books?? Sobrang below the belt na, hindi na related sa trabaho. 

TL;DR: i was on sick leave when our head plant came to office para sunduin kami then she got mad cause i didn’t “informed” her tapos owners of the company said na mag confess ako and gave me prayer booklets",43,30,0.95,True,Rant 😡,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/1abaoa4/pinagkukumpisal_ako_ng_employer_ko/,2024-01-26 13:15:20,1abaoa4

683,Perfectionist na Team Lead,"Pa-rant lang haha. So I have this officemate na naka-close ko na over the years and honestly mabait naman sya. Pulido sya sa work so everyone trusts her. 

Problem is, she's a perfectionist. Actually gets ko naman na its sometimes okay lalo na pag involve ang work, to make things efficient and effective. She doesn't micromanage naman, kaya lang mahilig sya makialam sa diskarte mo ng pagtatrabaho kahit same lang naman ng end result. Tapos lahat nalang napapansin nya, as in. 
Gusto nya lagi na gayahin namin kung paano sya magwork. Tbh, ginawa na namin yun, and hindi naman kami nagrereklamo about it sometimes. 

Kaso pansin ko parang gusto nya yata pati way of thinking nya sa lahat ng bagay i-pattern din namin sa kanya. Lagi nya sinasabi suggestion lang naman daw, pero madalas nya inuulit. A bit of background on her, lumaki kasi syang independent at lahat gusto nya outlined and organized up to the last bit. Minsan ok lang samin yun ugali nya na yun kasi nakakatulong din naman samin sa work lalo na kung meron nao-overlook. 

Its just that we only felt lang na para bang iniisiip nya na that the way she does things is kinda like a standard na dapat din namin ma-adapt. Dumiskarte man kami ng sarili namin, kahit pa iisa lang naman ang output, pag minsan di sya satisfied e papansinin parin nya. Even on the smallest thing na hindi naman actually nakakaapekto sa work namin eh pinapansin parin nya.

685,"Great place to work ""Daw""","Hello po sa lahat i just need to get this of my chest to move foward. 

So i was working for this company na part of ""Great place to work in the Philippines"". Well as for my experience with company and the management, they doesn't deserve to be part of this great place to work kinesu. Why? Sobra yung bad experience ko sa company nato. Let me start the whole story.

Before being part of this company, i was working for a small bpo company along mandaluyong. Well the great thing about this small bpo na napasukan ko before is kahit maliit yung compensation package nila unlike other companies around it maka tao naman yung management at mga boss at yung politics nila dito. The only reason na i have to give up my career with them kasi hindi kakayanin at kulang na kulang pa ang sinasahod ko for my cost of living sa mandaluyong at sa binibigay ko sa family ko sa province (somewhere in south). Btw technical account yung hawak ko sa BPO nato. At dahil sa kulang na kulang at madalas ay short pa kasi maliit ang sahod na realize ko na ang hirap pala sa manila. Ang mahal ng cost of living ko vs sa sinasahod ko (take note hindi po ako condo living or what ha? Pero ang mahal padin ng expenses ko) nag decide ako na mag hanap nalang ng mas malapit na trabaho at makaka pag uwian ako samin para tipid na kesa ibabayad ko sa rental ko na 6k sa mandaluyong excluded pajan sa 6k rent yung bills ko electricity, water at internet.

So eto na nga, na kita ko sa FB na nag post sila ng open house and they're hiring for technical support with good compensation package (2x ng sinasahod ko sa bpo sa mandaluyong yung offer). Sobrang saya ko that time kasi dininig ng nasa itaas yung hiling ko na makahanap ng trabaho na malapit, may magandang pasahod at higit sa lahat eh pasok sa experience ko as a technical support. 

Eto na nga. Na hire nako sa company nato at nakapag resign ako ng ayos with the previous company. Dito na nag simula ang bad experience ko. First bad experience, nakalagay sa job posting ay ""technical support"" only to find out na hindi pala tech account to sales account pala at hard selling pa (pushy sale sobra). Hindi important kung maresolved mo ang concern ng cx mo mas importante kung mabebentahan mo ng ina-upsell mong products and services. I have nothing against this kind of things pero sana naging honest nalang sila sa job posting nila at nilagay nalang na ""Sales account for tech program"" hindi yung may pa ""technical account"" pa kayo eh wala naman kayong pake kung maresolve ba or hindi as long as mabentahan yung cx. Tapos kapag mahina ka bumenta automatic terminated ka. Naalala kopa nung unang pasok namin sa production para mag call sabi samin ng mga tenured agents ""Welcome to hell"" (ay talagang hell naman eh pag wala kang benta ippressure ka mag benta at talagang pahiya ka sa buong team)  Yung KPI nila yung sales ang largest chunk so pag di mo napasa yun wala goodbye trabaho ka talaga kahit anong galing mo mag calls or what kasi hindi naman yun need nila. Ang need nila e yung magaling bumenta kahit walang kwenta sa quality ng call at kahit hindi mo matulungan si cx pasok ka sa banga. Ako at yung mga kakilala ko na kasabay ko nakikita palang namin yung entrance nung office nasusuka na kami at uwing uwi na kasi alam naming impyerno na talaga don sa hirap.

Second, sakitin talaga akong tao at kahit sa previous company ko alam nilang sakitin ako at super thankful ako sa previous company kasi naiintindihan nila ako sa part nayon. Dito mga bes sa new company hindi. Kese hodang mamatay ka wala silang pake. Hindi valid mag kasakit dito. Grabe yung naging experience ko dito, imagine tinatrangkaso ako to the point na nag cchills na katawan ko tapos nag paalam lang ako sa TL ko na sana makapag request kahit 1 hr rest mula sa clinic wala naman akong balak mag pa sent home. kahit konting pahinga lang kasi hindi ko na talaga kaya. Yung 1 hr lunch ko itinulog ko na nga lang at ipinahinga pero talagang hindi kaya. Aba si accla sabi ba naman ""ano mas importante? Yang 1hr rest mo oh yang magiging lost hour mo na impacting not only for you but for the whole team"" aba teh? Ano bako? Robot hindi pwede mag pahinga? Hindi pwedeng mag kasakit? Eh kahit nga tinatrangkaso nako malala pinasukan ko padin siya tapos 1hr rest lang hindi pako mapagbigyan? At dahil sa kinukunsensya ako ng TL ko about it tiniis ko not until one time na hindi ko na talaga kinaya, tandang tanda ko yun last shift ko na sana kahit ang lala padin ng trangkaso ko I'm willing to got to work kasi last shift na and I'm just looking forward sa restday ko. Naging severe lalo yung trangkaso ko. Hindi ko na maikilos ng ayos ang katawan ko in pain nako sa buong katawan ko at parang pakiramdam ko eh nababaldado nako so nag pa checkup agad ako only to find out na may malalang bagay pala sa katawan ko na nag ccause bakit ako tinatrangkaso at nag kaka ganon (i won't disclose wthe whole medical thingy) to the point na i need to undergo major surgery for it. Aba ang TL ko mukhang wapakels sa situation ko mas importante padin ang mawawalang benta at lost hours kesa sa life and death situation na I'm dealing with. Grabe nakaka iyak lang na imagine kung mas maaga ako nakapag pa checkup at nabigyan ng pag kakataon na mag pahinga edi sana naagapan pero dahil sa selfishness nila at ng whole management hindi ko natutukan yung health ko. Tapos ang ending iteterminate nila ako dahil unfit na ako sa trabaho due to my health conditions at sa procedure na inunder-gone ko. Ginusto ko ba to? Kung pwede nga lang i-distribute yun sakit pinamigay ko na sainyong mga lakup yung sakit ko ng kayo ang makaranas nitong hirap na to ewan ko nalang kung kayanin niyo. Grabe yung inabot ko sa company nato. Drain na drain nako emotionally at mentally sa pinag dadaanan ko sa personal life ko tapos ganon pa sa trabaho. 


Apaka dami ko pang bad experience dito sa company nato na hindi kona i-include. Hindi worth-it yung pinapasahod ng company nato sa binibigay nilang stress sayo. Hindi naman ako pasaway na trabahador. Nag ttrabaho naman ako ng ayos. Pero bakit need kong maranasan tong mga bagay nato. May pasabi sabi pa silang dito work-life balance at people's first kami. The whole management it self is teaching us to be compassionate and empathetic towards our customer pero kayo mismong nasa management and higher op hindi niyo magawa sa mga ahente niyo. Well bilog ang mundo what comes around goes around ika nga. Lahat ng ginawa nyong mali sa trabahador niyo babalik sayo at sana 10x ang balik and for the record HINDI nyo deserve mapasama sa the great place to work kasi HINDI naman kayo marunong trumato ng tama sa mga nag ttrabaho sainyo sa dami niyong kaso sa NLRC ng unjustified termination hindi ko alam pano pa kayo nakaka pasok sa criteria na ""best place to work"" kung ganon yung management and work environment niyo.

Nov 24, 2023 - I informed my superior and team that Nov 30 will be my last day since the management did not accept the waiver of my notice period

Nov 30, 2023 - last day of work. surrendered all company assets and sent the transition plan to my superior

Dec 11, 2023 - received Return-to-work order and it was mentioned that if i did not report to work within 5 days, i will get dismissed.

Jan 8, 2024 - received notice of termination dated january 2. 

i informed them that i was already dismissed since dec 16 (5days after i received the RTW order) and remind them the 30days allowable time to give my backpay.

they said that i have to get my clearance signed first before they will release the backpay within 30days.

Jan 11, 2024 - i authorized someone in the company to route my clearance. Clearance is now on-going

Jan 18, 2024 - i received information that my clearance will get hold since 1 person to sign my clearance (my former superior) is on maternity leave. 

I cant wait for her to get back to received my backpay. i even did not received my 13th month pay for 2023.

I already filed an eSENA and waiting for DOLE's response.

Also, no penalties for not rendering 60days in my contract

Gets ko pa sana kung start-up eh, pero hindi na. For context, I'm working at a small digital agency na ang specific niche ay local baby businesses. The value proposition is nice, pero for someone lowballed from 70k to 40k (at hinayaan ko na nga kasi once a month on site lang naman), I think managing 10 shitty clients per day and being the only one doing client facing (via call) in behalf of the work of the specialists is just...unreasonable. Gustuhin ko man to be more involved in the business and team development side, shet, ang lean ng team and we have around 30-40 clients! 

It also doesn't help na communications keep moving from one platform to the other. Pumasok ako na Slack ang gamit, later on Asana na without proper team transition and tutorial how Asana even works. So ayan, no questions asked, magkakagulo talaga because for an unknown reason, biglang gusto lumipat ng internal comms! 

Nagmamakaawa ako sa mga small company: downfall niyo talaga if you don't make things right from the inside. Nagrereflect yan on how we do workaround with clients. Bukod sa di na protected yung team at the absence of a religious process that clients can respect, puro shitty leads pa maaattract niyo kasi nagpapatapak kayo. 

Ending, I'm leaving this small digital agency and going back to my old. Doon, kahit umiiyak ako sa pressure, protected ako ng communications na properly recorded comms. They offered me the same salary and bukod sa familiarity, mas kaya ko na yung iiiyak ko pa doon -- ok na umiyak sa may process, kesa dun sa maiistress ako na walang process (like, ako pa ba girl magaayos ng processes?

Technically, I am under his supervision, but we hold the same position in the company due to regionalization.

Recently, I encountered a problem with manpower, so I decided to outsource some additional manpower. However, as per our PD, we need to maximize the overall manpower in our department, which requires us to undergo reorganization. Three clients will now be merged, and the workload will be divided among the areas that my colleague and I are currently handling.

To my surprise, my 1st boss had a meeting with my supervisor, who is in charge of the clients I handle, and they discussed a reorganization plan without informing me.

To summarize:
My boss bypassed me and decided to handle the three clients alone without communicating with me.
She was offered a national position but declined it, suggesting that I should be transferred instead. The other boss agreed to this plan, but our higher-level bosses are unaware of it.
If they insist on transferring me, I prefer to resign.

Pero, sa employer, to prevent furthur disputes, magbibigay yan ng compensation sa employee, in a condition na ang employee, di na aakyat sa korte to file a case against the employee for something na may paglabag sa karapatan ng employee.

699,May LinkedIn Account ba kayo? Ano silbi niya sa inyo bukod sa paghahanap ng work?,"Simula nung napadpad ako sa Corporate World 2 yrs ago, marami akong natutunan siyempre sa **professionalism** as an employee. Sa mga walang alam katulad ko noon, akala ko talaga ang **LinkedIn** ay para lang siyang **Jobstreet**, **Indeed** (by the way, dito ako nakahanap ng work), or **Glassdoor** na hanapan lang talaga ng work. Pero hindi pala. Social Site pala talaga siya na intended for professionals.

Sa'kin kasi inayos ko talaga **LinkedIn** Profile ko kahit hindi ko nagagamit sa Current work ko. Nilagyan ko talaga na custom Cover Photo, Profile Pic na pang-Facebook ang datingan, ayoko nga mag-picture ng Grad Pic du'n. Pinoy lang naman gumagawa nu'n. Sa ibang bansa naman, parang profile pic na rin sa typical na social media, tapos Description/About Me ko talaga ang haba. Yung Work Experiences ko, nilagay ko talaga pati tasks na ginagawa ko pati naglagay ako iilang pictures. Para hindi lang imbento at totoo talaga. Pati Projects nilalagay ko. Tapos nagpo-post ako once a month. Tapos halos twice a day ko binubuksan, umaga at gabi para lang i-open mga Notifications na hindi ko naman binabasa.

Ang International kasi masyadong yung approach ng **LinkedIn**. Hindi makamasa. Kahit yung **Philippine HR Group** du'n, mas active mga taga-ibang bansa. Kumbaga sa Pinas, parang **HR** lang yata talaga active du'n para mag-post ng **Job Hiring.**

Useful naman siya sa totoo lang. Kaya nga lang may bayad para manood ng mga webinar, or video tutorial or video lesson, may pa-premium pa.

Kaya curious ako sa mga LinkedIn Profile ninyo, active ba kayo roon? Like nagagamit niyo ba siya sa day-to-day work ninyo? Nagpo-post din ba kayo? May ka-interact din ba kayo parang News Feed niyo or puro re-post lang kayo? May laman ba siya kung may achievements ba kayo sa school or work? Updated ba LinkedIn ninyo?

May company ba rito na yung LinkedIn Account nila big deal? Like ayon talaga gamit nilang social for work, communication with colleagues, hindi mga messaging app katulad ng WhatsApp, Viber, Skype or Telegram. Tipong every work related, ginagamit talaga yung LinkedIn nila or depende lang talaga sa Department ng Work 'to?

PS.

Simula nung ginawa ko rin pala nung inayos ko yung LinkedIn Profile ko, nilagyan ko siya ng laman, tapos nagpo-post nga ko kahit once a month lang, ang dami ko natatanggap na Job Offers/Opportunities, even Internationals, at mga Life Insurance.

Yung mga companies (big or small) na kung makapag set ng policies ay akala mo sila na yung may-ari sa buhay ng employees nila; 6-days work week, split-offs, sudden schedule changes, etc. Idagdag na din yun pagpilit na ""we're family here"" culture.

714,Am I an ungrateful person or I am just a greedy envious employee? A post about salary which should I ask an increase or do I even deserve it?," Hello there I am quiet in a predicament here since I have been working for this company for almost 4 years now this coming march and I'm just wondering would it be fine if I would ask my boss directly to give me a raise? Note: This was first ever job so I don't really know what to do.

When I got hired back then for a specific position I performed well and pretty much became a top performing agent hence I actually got promoted eventually after a year of working in this position but my daily rate didn't change and still the same which was PHP 909.09.

I accepted the promotion even though my daily rate is still the same but was told that I would get an increase after passing the probation period hence I gladly accepted and worked diligently.

After months passed 6 months I finally got a a salary increase and my daily rate would now be PHP 1k I am a bit sad since I thought that it would be at least a bigger amount which I mean for minimum wage is already big even x2 so I told to myself that it is good enough and just be grateful which I really am.

Time passed new people got promoted for my position so I somewhat got promoted without announcement since I was now an assistant manager to our department which I am now the one who trains new trainers which I definitely did without any salary increase. As time passed by when the new trainers probation ended which only took them 2 months instead of said 6 our salary became the same I got an increase as well as them and the same amount as mine which was 1200php a big jump I am happy for myself and definitely don't mind them having same salary as me even though I have been working for the company far longer than they are but I guess I should just be thankful and not be devoured by envy or is it envy?

now time passed by almost two years having the same rate the company faced some issues hence the hiring process got halted then we had take up a lower position which going back to what we used to do hence our salary went back to the first rate that I had when I was just starting but still I stuck with the company and worked well at first but definitely felt bummed out that my salary got so little but nevertheless I got some commissions out of my hard work which made my salary bigger.

Months passed by which now is the current timeline I was able to get back into my position as an assistant manager with the same rate back then 1,200. My question would now be is that would it be fine for me to ask a raise to my boss I know its big but we only work on average 20 days per month or even 22 days max.

I am grateful for what I am receiving but I guess its a bit little considering we work from home and we don't have any incentives whether for internet or anything no government contributions with all this inflation going up I guess my salary would/should also go up I guess I don't really know what to do.

Am I an ungrateful person? or am I just a greedy one? or should it be fine to ask a raise despite on what's going on with the company or i don't really even know what I am currently ranting right now but I guess its just clearly that I am not contented with I am receiving. which makes me look like I am an ungrateful bastard or idrk.

720,"so my ex-ad agency is so disgusting, especially the executive director","EDIT: a lot of people are messaging me to drop the name, para maiwasan. i'll just use emojis. you will get it if you've been looking at creative job openings at jobstreet.

🛸🐑

background: this ad agency located in mother ignacia, QC is so notorious employees couldn't keep up. they would only employ 10-11 people supporting a lot of clients (they're too many i lost count). 6 out of 10 employees decided to leave because:
1. they dump a shit ton of workload on us without giving us a chance to negotiate, kasi we need to keep our ""partners"" happy
2. managers would file insane incident reports on us for not complying to the deadline. 6/10 employees had PIPs at one point because of it.
3. a lot of ICs work beyond working hours without pay (8am-5pm schedule), because according to our contract, OT pay is invalid in a WFH set up. so during covid no one had any OT pays. there was no consideration even when some of my colleagues timed out at 5am, which was seen by all employees.
4. a manager was shocked that his overworked IC was denied regularization because apparently this executive director bitch decided to weigh in evals from other managers without informing him
5. we are not paid properly even though we were promoted. we had one colleague who was promoted from junior to senior IC with only an appraisal of 1-3k
6. in our quarterly evals, we have this ""team engagement"" shit criterion that bear a significant amount of weight. this is based on our engagement during ""fun meetings"" where we only play jackbox despite our workload. they'll give us low scores here kapag hindi kami favorite
7. no consideration to their employees especially if they're trying to reach a deadline. we had this colleague who was sick and had to take a week-long leave. when he came back, ED almost filed an incident report for loss of profit because they had to find a freelance resource to do his work
8. OA and feeling bagets si ED. she would yell in public, fake laugh, and make up stories to try to make us laugh. muntanga lang kala niya cute siya pag ganon siya
9. they have an offensive sense of humor at times. they're very fond of body shaming.
10. we had another colleague who caught covid and eventually recovered without any financial support from the company. when he came back, HR announced that SSS (i forgot the gov agency) can cover expenses for covid recovery. this colleague asked HR and the CEO in front of all of us if he's qualified to get one even though he has already recovered, to which they answered no and fucking laughed at his face saying ""kawawa ka naman""
11. ED would backstab a former employee who worked poorly during his time in the company, and would constantly make him the butt of the joke of every single thing that she thinks was funny. imagine being a fucking joke to a whole company

it's a lot but that's just the tip of the iceberg. 

no one came forward to DOLE, despite a lot of us talking about it. we feared that if we do so, it'll lessen the chance of finding a new job. heck, a lot of us badly needed work that time.

so fast forward, they recruited a lot of people to fill in the vacancies, most of them are fresh graduates or just got out of their first job. they've also fully RTO'd, and they've been posting stories on their company IG account whenever they have a fun thing going on.

ok so ito ang chika. ED's new directive for the company's social media is to show how ""happy"" they are as a ""family"" to spite those who left. a lot of former employees (including me) are still mutuals with that account, that's why she thought of doing it. napaka-immature talaga. she's 52 for god's sake. 

i don't care how they are doing right now in terms of fun, but i unfollowed them because i keep seeing the ED's face i just wanna throw up.

ito pa, she's keeps on making fun of some former employees like what she did to the former-former one. walang pakundangan kung magsalita. she really thinks she's so fucking funny. i may not be one of them but i feel so bad for them.

though to be fair, current employees do not like her at all. they feel the same way we did when we were still employed there (kaya nakasagap din ako ng chika). they're currently making plans and finding a new job before they could submit their resignation.

this ad agency's never gonna be better if they keep being like that. i'm not sure if other companies behave the same way, but if you want to gain loyalty and productivity from your employees, please, see your employees as humans. that's all we ask for.

tl;dr: ED is trying to make us former employees regret leaving the company by posting stories on their company IG of how ""happy"" they are as a ""family"". truth is the company is disgusting as fuck in terms of employee treatment, that's why a lot of us had to leave, as well as the current ones who replaced us.",32,18,1.0,True,Story 🗣️,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/1afvjgi/so_my_exad_agency_is_so_disgusting_especially_the/,2024-02-01 07:02:09,1afvjgi

724,Abusive Business Partner,"Not sure if this is the right sub pero let me just share this experience with my business partner, the reason I pulled out my investment as well.

I'm no biggie in business pero I run multiple (bigasan, food franchises, small carwash, village parking space and Airbnb in surf area up north), yung iba dyan I owned talaga, others are shared businesses. I still work as a fulltime in a digital agency kasi alipin pa rin tayo ng salapi and I've been in the office since 2015 din and okay naman sya.

Since kilala naman ako ng mga colleagues ko about my businesses, this young colleague and hinawakan ko rin sya before, approached me to asked about starting a small business, so I asked ano business and assess kung ano ba knowledge nya sa papasukin nya. He'll be partnered daw by his mom and girlfriend so I thought okay sya. The way he tells me his plans was good so I offered to give him free consultancy and coaching sa business. Then I told him may new business ako na nakuha (refreshment drinks) baka pwede makiplace in tapos hati na lang sa kita. It run smoothly ng mga 5 months na and my sales are good din. Although the main business is slowly progressing, pero ups naman sya. I decided to invest na rin sa negosyo nya, ako nagayos ng inventory system tapos ako naghanap ng mga direct suppliers na mas mura talaga and also pag may mga meeting ako, nagdadala ako ng products namin to offer as free taste or minsan binibenta ko sa clients haha.

Pero 1 thing I notice bakit mabagal ang sales nila before is papalit palit yung empleyado and laging nagsasara kasi wala raw tatao. I asked him about the employees kasi on paper parang well compensated naman, sa viber chats sobrang okay naman sila makipagusap pero sabi nya ang aarte daw kasi nila. So I offered my help and called my batchmate sa school na looking for work, sa carwash ko talaga sya ilalagay pero nakiusap ako na baka pwede dun muna sa sa store na isa, luckily parang 20 mins away lang sya sa location mas malapit sya actually than my carwash. So at first month okay din ang feedback ni batchmate pero hindi sa colleague ko but to his gf and mom. Marunong daw makisama and natuturuan, pero pag si colleague tinatanong ko sa kanya, sabi nya sa akin is he rarely shows up and always may bad mouth about them as employees. I asked my batchmate kung gusto nya lumipat na sa carwash, which he, without any hesitation said, yes.

Right there, alam ko na tama yung tingin ko, may issue si colleague running a business. He got mad at me when I told him ipupullout ko na yung batchmate ko, kasi tao ko naman talaga sya sa carwash, saying mahihirapan ulit sya humanap ng store manager na hindi maarte. I told him ako maghahire ng tao for his convenience. Nakakuha ako ng tao and sanay talaga sya magmanage ng store, pero sabi ko sa kanya ireport nya sakin ang nangyayari sa store. Weeks later she told me medyo di nga maganda yung palakad ng colleague ko, so I decided magsurprise visit, I asked our store manager to inform me pag papunta sya. After all I almost thought na ako na yung nagpapatakbo ng business namin, from the money I brought in, yung clients and bulk orders na pinasok ko as sales and more. Di nga lang ako makapunta sa pwesto regularly sa dami ng lakad ko here in Metro and province.

Last Saturday, I received a message from store manager, pupunta si colleague with his gf and mom. So pumunta rin ako. I arrived 30 mins later after them and dumaan ako sa likod na door para hindi nila kita. Kakapasok ko pa lang ng gate, I heard my colleague voice saying ""*umalis ka sa harap ko, wala kang kwenta!*"" So di muna ako pumasok since rinig ko from the near window mga convo nila. Then I heard him again talking to that employee na ""*Umuwi ka, ang bobo bobo mo, yan na lang trabaho mo e*."" That employee ran to open the door where I was standing outside, pagbukas nya nagulat sya na andun ako. I saw her eyes na teary na so sumenyas ako na wag magingay and wait nya ko kasi papasok ako ng store.

Upon entering, I heard him shouting to his gf na nasa storefront ""*sabihin mo kay \*store manager, bilisan yung audit at baka maghanap si \*ako ng report, atat pa naman lagi yun.*"" like ang usapan naman every Saturday afternoon magpasa siya ng report sa akin. Si Store manager on her break pero my colleague told her to do the task kahit nakabreak since pwede naman daw sya gawin ng nakaupo.

In my mind, the dude is very different compared pag nasa office sya. Okay sya makipagusap and very positive yung character nya. You can see his immaturity pero gets mo kasi bata pa but he's improving naman.

Since nasa loob na ko, nakatalikod sya sakin, I called his attention. He was surprised and asked if bakit di raw ako dumaan sa harap. I told him kanina pa ko dun and naririnig ko sya, and I heard everything he said about our employees to his badmouth against me. He asked me for a management's talk, usap daw kami pati gf nya. I accepted, pero I asked the employees to join the meeting para malaman bakit ganun ang nangyayari. I was shocked when I heard from our employees yung mga words na ""*mga di kasi kayo nagaral kaya wag kayo magfeeling expert.*"" ""*pang sari sari store lang diskarte nyo hindi pang corporate.*"" and ""*Nagmamagaling ka, wala ka namang kwenta*."" these words daw came to my colleagues mouth kapag nagagalit sya.

So kaya pala nagaalisan mga tao namin, kahit ako aalis pag ganyan. I let our employees out na pero I requested to close the store and go home para they can cool down a bit. I talk to my colleague and his partner that I cannot run business with them kung ganyan sya, right there I said, magpupullout ako ng investments and assets ko. Si colleague nagalit, I can pullout daw pero yung drinks ko lang not the money I invested, akala siguro di ko binabasa yung books, sabi ko we gain since I invested so I will take my money and pati ibang gamit dun na galing sa akin. Yung profit, kanya na kung ayaw nya ibigay.

Last Monday, I pulled out yung mga investments ko sa kanila, I talk to my colleagues mom and gf, mas madali kausap yun e, they helped me withdraw my invested money sa bank, did the paperwork tas pina notary namin. The store is close since then, wala nang pumasok na employees namin. Si colleague, di sya nagpakita that time, absent din sa office, until now. Our CEO knows naman kasi sinumbong pa pala ako nun, pero sabi nya, labas sya sa transactions namin kasi di sya part ng business nya, he spoke to me naman, I told my boss na I can work with him professionally sa company but not as business partner.

Earlier I received a separate viber group from our 3 employees, di na raw sila papasok, I asked them if nabayaran ba sila nung last pay, ayaw nila na kunin. I told them ako na magbabayad, ayaw sana nila pero sabi ko pinasok naman nila yun so babayaran ko, right nila yun e. I also told them na I will help them find new jobs na fit sa kanila. Luckily si Store Manager nailakad ko na sa client ko before pa, she will start ata by feb 15. Yung 2 naman, I refer them to my client's na (convenience store company and logistics/courier company). I also send them a sack of rice each and some groceries.

Nakakahiya talaga yung experience and I learned a lot from this. I will always grateful to those employees who worked for me kaya as much as possible I'll give them extended help. At the very least nakalabas kami lahat sa toxic environment na yun.

727,O.A. ba ako para magresign?,"I, 22M just recently started working at this restaurant/cafe (they started transitioning to a restaurant since they're widely known as a cafe) this is my first job and i got hired and started training around the third week of november last year. The training was fun since i really enjoyed the people i trained with. A month later i got deployed into one of their restaurant branches, i was a BIT shocked since i applied for a barista position and was deployed as a dining staff right after training. The interviewer once told me that I might have a chance on becoming a dining staff and asked that if it's okay with me, i gladly said yes since i thought it would looked good for my cv lol. As someone who needed money i sucked it up and tried my best to work there. The thing is, my schedule is a mess. It's not given weekly. let's say the schedule will be given today, and my scheduled work can range up to just 2 to 4 days from now and i might be am shift now but pm shift tomorrow (they're fucking up my body clock lol). I also have a hard time anticipating when my OFF will be unless it's a request off 🥹. My seniors there are all used to it since they're already working there for a year or so. What put me to the edge of resigning is that i once worked 7 days straight with two consec days off, And just the other day, i worked for 8 days straight with two consec off. One of my senior even bragged to me that he worked for 12 days straight 🥲 i immediately thought that that's not something to be happy about 😅. Today i'm on my second day off and natatakot ako na baka papagurin nila uli ako for 7-8 days 🥲

Now please tell me if OA ba ako magresign? I know I just worked there for a couple of months and prolly some of ya'll are gonna tell me na normal lang yan sa ""adulting"" and that i just need to ""suck it up"" 🥲 but I just want a constant schedule and a 5-6 days a week of work 🥹

PS. I graduated from a culinary program (i stopped loving my program when I was on my 3rd year of college hehe, i wanted to shift but decided to go through with it since naawa na ako sa parents ko magpaaral sakin) After graduating, nag try ako mag apply for a barista position since feel ko mag e-enjoy parin ako in the F&B industry (di na pala lol) people have been encouraging me to work in the BPO industry since i have basic english naman daw and could easily land a job there since i'm a college grad 🤔",4,7,0.84,True,Advice Needed 🤔,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/1ag6zqb/oa_ba_ako_para_magresign/,2024-02-01 17:18:09,1ag6zqb
728,How to deal with “positive toxicity” ng department head nyo?,"As the title goes, how you guys tolerate this at your workplace?

Just sharing mine. I have this ""department head"" na sobrang mag motivate sa team for us to perform.

Heavy reliant sa KPI and performance ng bawat isa. We understood naman yung weight ng mga deliverables namin pero kulang pa rin ng support from the management. This DP is the one who has an access to our upper management so most of the time sya ang kausap and kameeting with regards to everthing that is happening sa amin and irerelay na lang nya sa amin ano updates once they are done.

Noon pa to issue but lately lang naging open mga kasama ko sa work. Hilig nya mag comment ng positive thoughts (which is good) pero if you'll analyze things, hindi makakatulong yung ""Go Team!
Kaya natin to"" if si management kulang sa support on how we will gonna deliver our KPls.

Example na lang. Limited bugdet or to no budget for activities para mas makagalaw kami ng maayos, no proper office set-up to conduct meetings, kumbaga intrinsic motivation na lang ang kukuhaan mo ng inspirasyon to do your work.

In the end, we did our part pero hindi naman kami uusad kung puro diskarte lang namin. There should be support from the management. Anyway, hindi na gumagana yung mga positive phrases nya sa amin kasi alam namin that's just part of the play para gumalaw and mag perform kami at best.

Aware naman kami na bawal lumingon, OO Bawal dapat naka tinggin ka lang sa monitor mo simula umpisa ng shift mo hanggang uwian.  (stiff neck malala)

Ang weird lang na ultimo mga Team Lead na nagtatanong lang how to access files etc, ay na iiscreenshot den at nasasabihan na walang ginagawa.

So paano kami mag cocollab ng ideas namin if bawal kami mag usap at lumingon sa isa't isa?

Ito pa, Bawal kami umuwi ng sakto sa oras pag 5:00 pm uwi mo dapat 5:05 ka mag clock out ayaw nila ng honda go kahit tapos mo na ginagawa mo. like bakit? Hindi nyo naman kami binabayaran ng OT.

Tapos ung mga emails na hindi nasasagutan since naka off ung agent dapat daw sinasagutan so ano te? sasagutan nung agent kahit naka day off? kasalanan ba namin na hindi nareresolve ung issues kase mabagal kayo gumawa ng solution, kaya panay balik ung email.

Ang dami ng umalis sa company na ito, mostly ng mga kasama namin awol na kasi hindi na kaya. partida ung increase ko wala pa since ang sabi ng mga tenured depende sa trip ni tokwa.

tapos ito pa, ung leave mo or even SICK LEAVE WITH VALID PROOF LIKE LABS AND DOCTOR'S LETTER, approved man o hindi babawasan ka ng 0.7 sa KPI mo. so ayon kahit mamamatay kana dahil sa sakit mo kailangan mo pumasok HAHAHA.

577,Art Studio in BGC,"I’m too tired. Sobrang liit nang industriya sa Pilipinas, hindi naman ako makahanap nang lilipatan. Lilipat ka nga sa ibang art studio, bagsak mo ay same issues pa rin: crappy managers with crappy crunch culture. 

Nakakainis lang na it really is time to go pero wala akong choice but to stay kasi wala akong malipatan na mas matino. Kung baga, this is the lesser evil choice kaya kailangan ko magtiis kahit ang ewan na ng situation. 

1. Underpaid. I am not paid my market value. Nalowball ako for the own desire na makapasok sa gaming industry. I’m not the only one. 

2. No OT pay. OTs need to be approved by higher management. Nasa mindset na lang talaga ng mga artists na kailangan nila magstay kapag malapit na deadlines nang walang pay. Gaslighted into thinking rin kasi na “kayo naman gusto mag overstay sa office” or “kayo naman reason bakit need niyo habulin milestones niyo” 

3. People are convinced na the company is the standard for high salary base rates for artists ——— pero see #1 and #2

4. Pag nag resign ka, “hindi ka na family” so wala na sila pake sayo afterwards. Tipong, di ka na priority kasi di ka na affiliated pero nung employee ka pa dun, lakas maka convince sayo na pamilya tayo dito so they will do their best para mameet needs mo —— pero see #1 and #2. Medyo disappointing lang to see soon-to-be former employees getting snubbed, eh nagtatrabaho pa naman yung tao sayo, may binibring pa rin naman na pera sayo. 😒

5. Unconscious bias: sobrang lala. Pretty privilege? Naku po everywhere. Makikita mo na lang na puro pretty young men and women ang hinahire sa mataas na position. Gets, entertainment industry pero di naman primary ang looks sa pag manage ng projects. Potential-based hiring pero potential sa looks.

6. Marami ring issues within the core people ng business —— magaling lang mag sweep under the rug yung higher management sa issues at mabilis rin kasi mag convince sa mga tao na everything is fine and dandy kahit hindi. 

Ewan. Basta, wag na lang talaga tayo magpabudol sa “we are a family” mindset.

579,Hello. What should I do. Leave my job of 6 years or stay.,"I have been working with this BPO for 6 years now and I got too comfortable with the work from home setup since 2020 that I don't wanna let it go. 

I'm a CSR and never climbed the corporate ladder since I don't have that much needs aside the bills and life insurance I am paying monthly. 

Recently I have been moved to another project and I have been working with this project just fine for a year now but my new bosses keeps finding new issues with my ""work ethics"" per say. Recently clashed with a co-worker due to a difficult problem and customer and I was threatened that I will be sent to HR. Which rubbed me the wrong way as I have never experienced in this company for 5 years and other companies that I have been with. I also have been under multiple bosses and projects before.

This new project makes me wanna rip my hair out since the client is difficult to work with and I there are always constant threats from my boss that "" do x and get fired. "" ""You don't wanna be the last guy I forced to leave this company"". And It's getting too toxic for me. 

However, I love the remote setup, never need to go to the office and I am properly compensated. I also have a great work-life balance because of the work from home setup.

This includes companies such as Vistamall, Stamall, AllDay/AllHome/AllShoppe,  Planet, StreamTech, MGS Construction, Camella, Bria, Lumina, Vistaland, Prime Asset Ventures, Kratos, SI Power, Primewater,  etc

Andami niyang companies! And sa lahat ng kakilala ko, lahat sila walang contract! (Actually di ko sure kung lahat ng nalista ko sa taas ay wala, pero more than half niyan sure ako)

Tbh nagulat ako nung nag-apply ako at natanggap naman ako agad. Nakakairita pa HR sa company ko diyan, kasi bigla bigla sila magpainterview at exam. Tipong today tatawag tapos gusto bukas agad interview na. At magugulat ka na lang pagfinal interview mo na wala palang contract contract. Lahat ng pag-uusapan niyo verbal lang, walang written shit. Sa part ko ok naman un kasi nilayasan ko sila agad nang walang pakundangan. 15 days nga lang nirender ko kasi tulong sa team ko, pero I would have left immediately kung di lang ako concerned sa kanila.

With regard sa exp sa management, ok naman ung iba, pero ung iba toxic din. Parang different cogs of a machine kayo pero ung ibang parts kasi sablay kaya di rin kayo makapagfunction nang maayos. HAHA. And ang pangit lang na hindi streamlined iyong mga pwedeng istreamline na processes kaya ang kalat ng documents nila and even their books. Haha. Funny lang na sa dami ng gusto nilang mangyari hindi man lang nila malaman ano kailangan nila para maging efficient. 

Siguro kaya rin mahal magbenta ng products mga Villar groups kahit hindi naman talaga at par ung quality sa cost ng pricing nila? Marami kasing sinusunog para sa wala, so para maoffset ay mahal ang products. Malaki ang percentage ng costing sa risk? 

Medyo mataas din turnover rate sa company namin, and I think sa ibang villar companies din based sa alam ko. Ung sakin kasi personal reason. Pero mas marami talagang opportunities na mas maganda kasi compared sa kanila. I guess marami lang nagiistay dahil convenient?

Pero go gawin niyong stepping stone yan if you really need work. Parang madali naman makapasok pero initial screening sa amin dati ay logic math english din talaga muna. Doon maraming naligwak. 

Anyway ayun basically nagulat lang ako wala pa atang nagpost regarding this. Ang concerning kaya na wala kayong contract?

Si colleague ko is from Dept B while Im from Dept A. Our departments are under 1 umbrella which means that we work close together.

A year or two ago kasi, si Dept B need ng help from Dept A because they have a goal/target/project na ma collect ang info ng accounts/clients nila and that they had a deadline. So kami from Dept A, we helped the Dept B for that certain period of time kasi sobrang dami rin naman tlga ng accounts na yun. Pag nag callback ung tinawagan nila, we just have to get the information we needed. They were able to reach the goal naman sa deadline nila. Like what I mentioned earlier, it was around a year or two ago. The project is still ongoing pero hindi na siya ganun ka dami and urgent and we from Dept A hindi narin masyado nag hehelp to this specific process nila. 

Now, everytime na maka receive ako ng call for Dept B for this certain process, trinatransfer ko sa kanila kasi in the first place, this is not our process and not my job naman tlga. And tapos naman na din ung time na nagprovide kami ng help sa kanila.

I had 2 calls earlier returning the missed call from Dept B. So I transferred all of them to them. Then nag chat nalang ung colleague ko sa GC namin na if I could assist nalang sana yung ganung process, it would be a big help sa kanila. 

Wala naman problem kung mag hehelp ako pero kasi alam nyo yun, hindi naman yan part ng job ko. It’s an additional task saken (though konti lang nmn task ko). Siguro may hugot lang tlga ako dito kasi ive done a lot na sa dept namin and wala masyadong recognition and now if I continue helping the other dept, what benefit ang makukuha ko dito. Wala naman.

And then ngayon lang, ang ingay pa din nila. Sobrang nakakadistract.Sa halip makakapahinga ng konti sa wholeday na trabaho. Napapa isip na lang ako "" I thought educated people are well mannered""

600,Lalaban or susuko na?,"Hello mga ka-OP. Would just like to hear your advices/comments. I’ve been in this job for almost 3 years. Startup company ito and I have witnessed their growth since day 1. The job is very stressful and the pressure is really high ksi fast-paced tlga and pukpukan ang work. Although I can manage naman but recently, I realized that it’s taking the life out of me. Tumanda itsura ko, on weekends or even every day outside working hours, wala akong peace of mind because I have to constantly respond to my teammates/bosses inquiries whenever they have one. Basta I am currently living to work and not the other way around. 

Do you think it’s a shame if I quit this job? Or normal lang ba na gnito tlga ang buhay masaklap. I don’t have any motivation to work and may mga red flags and unfairness din ksi na di acceptable pra sakin.

603,Planning to transition from BPO to Freelancing due to stress,"
I have been  part of the BPO industry since 2007 and currently occupying a managerial role in a prominent call center in Luzon, my professional journey has been marked by stress, particularly due to client interactions, operational responsibilities, and engagement with various stakeholders. Despite my dedication, the toll on my mental health has become evident, especially after being diagnosed with hypertension in my late 30s. The demanding nature of my position has led to panic attacks and recurring dreams centered around workplace stressors, indicating an unhealthy work-life balance.

In an effort to alleviate the strain on my well-being, I've explored alternatives, attending online seminars on freelancing basics. However, discovering a suitable niche remains a challenge. Despite holding a managerial position in the support department, the prospect of continuing in my current role appears detrimental to my mental health.

609,Waste of time onsite invitation to their office [interview process],"So I applied for this one well known optical/eye wear company since my first impression of them is that they seem ""progressive"" since their owners are millenials. Then, I was invited for an initial interview with HR , seems okay, then I was invited to have an interview with the Hiring Manager.. (this is where the red flags begin to appear), Hiring Manager wasn't able to interview me due to a ongoing meeting, but HR should have been able to inform me, I am okay to wait for 30 minutes if ever, am also okay to be rescheduled, but no! I WAITED FOR 2 HOURS before the HR said that the interview will be rescheduled. Wasted time is wasted money since i filed a half day to really invest my focus and time on this company. After a few weeks, I was rescheduled (finally!), so far the waiting time shortened from 2 hours to almost an hour only. I was underwhelmed by the questions of the hiring manager, I was expecting more in depth questions so I can showcase my experience. Thankfully I was invited to their office for a final interview. Here goes the waiting game again, 30-45minutes in the lobby, 1-2 hours waiting for someone to fetch me in their conference area, then I was interviewed again by someone in HR, after that, they were waiting for the Hiring Manager's update if there's anything else I should meet or do, so I waited and waited and lunch time came, there were no more interviews! 😪 then the HR said that I was free to stay but as of that moment, i respectfully declined their offer and requested if there's anything I need to do/meet before I go home. There was so much time wasted already, I was expecting something productive since I filed a leave again to attend this onsite shit. Fast forward to today (after a month and half) I was informed that I wasn't shortlisted ❤️‍🩹

I am really angry on how they don't respect one's time. I understand that people really need to invest time and money to attend onsite interview, but if your process if inefficient, better remove those onsite shit and postpone interviews if you have meetings. Anong sible ng calendar management. Sayang ang sahod at leave sainyo. I guess I dodged a bullet nadin, I saw some negative reviews in glassdoor specially for that department i wanted to apply to. 

Weird part: Hiring Manager asked me if I applied before, I said yes, (i really wanted to join their company), Hiring Manager asked for the name of the person that interviewed me, i said that i forgot, he told me that it's fine since that the person probably resigned, most of the people have resigned on that department and hiring manager just joined last year. Stalked their LinkedIn as well, and it showed that almost all of the people in their team were recently hired as well. Hmmm something's fishy 🤔

613,Not regularized because of performance issue,"Hi, I wanted to cry since I got fired this week and management decided not to regularize me because of poor performance and knowledge issue. 

I work in a big chinese construction firm wherein we handle biddings. I am determined to know everything from processing documents to the structure of the company. While working on this company, I was really challenged to build the puzzle piece by piece because of lack of proper briefing. I was able to ask questions but the thing was, how can I ask certain questions if I don't know the gap. So much processes to the point that I always ask myself on what should I do first and that. So in the end, I'm so confused on what to do.

Aside from that, some people are not really accomodating to questions and sometimes regarded as ""makulit"" even if I just want specific clarification after a research so I became so anxious to ask questions. Also, we don't have domain for documented email communication and use an app for delegation of stuffs. I really do think that It is one of the factor.

So let's get to the bottom line. I don't know where to start. I just really want to cry and I really don't know how to apply to the next compnay without any hassle. Feeling so incompetent and I don't know where to go now since I don't have enough fund to rent a place . Feeling like a piece of crap. I don't know if someone will hire me on the next company. I'm good at other things it's just that it is really  hard to get a job nowadays that's why  I took this opportunity rightaway.

I really do appreciate any advices. Thank you so much.

614,Resignation Acceptance?,"Edit:

HR has advised me that the Feb 29, 2024 last date is because we follow the working week not calendar week. Anyone could give me more clarity regarding this?

----------------


Hi everyone. So a bit of a background, I have sent mg resignation notice last Jan 30, 2024 (tuesday) with a notice period of 4 weeks as per my contract, therefore my last day would be on Feb 27, 2024.


I have sent my notice via email to my immediate supervisor and I cc'd our Senior Ops Manager and Director. However our Senior Ops Manager only acknowledged my email on Thursday, Feb 1, 2024. Our SOM then setup a 1:1 to discuss the resignation the day after, Friday Feb 2. However it was moved to yesterday, Monday Feb 5. Then again moved to today, Feb 6.

Now, upon our 1:1, our SOM insists that my render period will only start WHEN they approved my resignation (which I know is not true), and would effectively move my effective final day.

Question 1. since I know that as per law, the minimum notice period should be 30 days, magtetake affect pa rin ba yung notice ko na 4 weeks (28 days) even though as per law minimum dapat ay 30?

Question 2. Anong pwede kong gawin sakaling ipilit nila yung ""kailangan iaccept yung resignation bago tumakbo yung 30 day"" especially since they delayed the acknowledgement and  1:1 to effectively start the render period?",9,19,0.91,True,Advice Needed 🤔,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/1akgs5f/resignation_acceptance/,2024-02-07 02:31:32,1akgs5f
615,DO NOT APPLY AND BEWARE OF: Trimotors Technology Corp.,"Do not even try to apply at this company. Their starting salary is 14k (UPDATE: 15,900 na raw ngayon). Their Supervisor’s max salary is 25k. And Manager’s max salary is 40k!!

They only want their employees to work onsite everyday + they do not know how Maternity and Paternity Leave works. For instance: My Wife’s manager forced my wife to cut her Maternity Leave short as the manager said they need her to work. Another sample when one of their colleagues said to my Wife that the HR MANAGER doesn’t know how Paternity Leave works!! Lmao!!

The office is located in MUNTINLUPA, NCR!! NCR tapos 14k? No thanks! Tapos 1k lang salary increase nila annually! 

Very unprofessional din sila ‘cause I’m not working at their company and yet they’re messaging me via MESSENGER and asking where is my Wife. Take note that they asked my Wife whereabouts during Weekend and Sick Leave. Utos daw ng isang manager. Wow.

Do not believe me? Ask one of their employees or try to apply. Nakakahiya sila!

I’m a TL in a small BPO, handling 20 FTEs. And bilang feeling close ako sa lahat, tropa na turing ko sa iba that we started to form a GC sa Hangouts (which we use at work).

The contents of the GC range from what we’re currently bingewatching to things that we think may improve for the company. Included syempre yung mga lait sa ibang tao sa floor. 

My OM, to whom I’m directly reporting, pulled me aside one day and asked me if i have an idea as to why. I told him no. So, OM asked me if we have a GC at work. Curious, sabi ko we do. He then said na may nag leak ng screenshots from the GC, and possible na ma escalate daw mga tao don. 

As stated before, most of the people in the floor nalait namin. Complete pa yun with pics. And as a lead, I do express my disdain and exasperation sa GC na yun. A lot.

If the person who escalated it is not privy to the conversation, may grounds ba yung escalation subject to termination?

631,Intrusive tracking software in company device,"Hi, my co-workers and I (working for an American company, WFH) discovered that there's an activity and location-tracking software installed in our company-issued laptop.

I won't mention the name of the software to protect our identity, but we did some research and learned that such software can take screenshots and photos of us (thru the laptop's main camera) without us knowing. This software can also track our location.

We were not informed at all about this software when our laptop was given to us and I was wondering if you think its a good idea to bring this up with HR and/or concerned agencies (we have a few in mind that can help us)? 

While we understand that we're using company-issued devices but still, such devices are being used in our private spaces (i.e. our homes). And knowing what the software can do --- especially yung part na it takes photos of us without us knowing, sobrang creepy talaga. A coworker also mentioned that she worked in another company before and she was informed  beforehand that there's an activity-tracking software in their company-issued laptop, so at least she's aware.

However, in our case, we weren't informed at all. Do you think may laban kami? Is it just reasonable to call out the management regarding this?

633,wanna quit after 2 weeks,"&#x200B;

I'm so upset LOL kasi EA dapat ako but my job is mainly calling people to remind them of their loans because my client owns a pawn shop. I expected to do marketing and other EA tasks, not fucking soliciting payments. During the interview, he mentioned making outbound calls and I said I was fine with that because he said I'll be making 10-15 a week lang but I spend all 4 hours calling people to remind them to pay. This isn't EA work and I feel like a call center agent (no hate to ya'll I just would rather d!3 than talk to people all day). 

Ang baba rin ng pay. $4.8/hr for a part-time (4h/day, 5d/week) Executive Assistant. Job posting said 25k starting salary but naging 21k. Tried to negotiate this but he said since training period pa lang naman 21k muna, I accepted this because I'm a student pa lang naman.

This suuuuper super super took a toll on me kasi fixed graveyard hours siya and I fucking hate what I'm doing-- it does not align with the expectations that were set during the interview at all. I started doing S/H again, getting 0.5 seconds of sleep, and broke up with my partner kasi sobra yung stress ko...

Im the admin of the company and its a small company (only 5 employees). I handle the acct stuff. But since she’s the sole trustee of my boss. All the transfer of money goes to her bank account. so the rebate of doctors goes to her pocket. we have fb page and almost all of our customers came from or nakita kami sa facebook. pero kapag bumili ang customer nag kakaroon ng doctor na nag refer at ang boss namin ay hindi niya alam at never niya kinompirma kung totoo ba talaga na doctor ang nag refer or from fb lang or google. So easy money sa kanya mapupunta automatic ang rebate ng doctor na yun. ngayon nga nag papagawa ng bahay ahahaha. pero ang story niya samin iba iba. may nag sabi ang sabi daw ng asawa niya pinapili daw siya ng boss namin kung ipapagawa yung bahay nila or Nmax. wow? knowing our boss na sobrang kuripot at chinese.

Hindi din ako naniniwala. Kaya ko nasasabing nag sisinungaling siya kasi 2019 pa lang mag kasama na kami at hindi pa siya manager nun. close kami. I know na hindi niya ma aaford lahat ng ito just because sumasahod siya ng 30 - 50k a month. tapos every week may bago siyang gold necklace,relo,earings,rings etc. tapos pinag resign niya pa yung asawa niya. Hihingi lang po ako ng advice kung dapat ko na ba siyang sabihin sa boss ko? or no I’ll just resign and kalimutan na lahat. kasi hindi ako makapag work ng maayos knowing all this and keeping my mouth shut.

646,Nalaman Ko Lang Sa Mga Tao...,"February 12, 2024 | 18:13:28 UTC +8

Ventilus Castelus

Klepac - Liham 02

Sa araw-araw na buhay ko, tingin ko sa mga tao, parang mga normal na maskara lang. Iba-iba ang hitsura. May masaya, may malungkot, may dismayado, iba-iba. Kahit sa mga araw na nagtatrabaho ako, parang nawalan lang ako ng gana na makialam pa sa mga kung anuman ang nararamdaman ng mga yan. Opiñon ko lang, ang boring. Siguro, mukang sarili ko lang ata ang matuturingan kong “best friend” sa panahon ngayon.

Minsan, nag-try na din akong makisama. Ayos at normal naman sa una, pero nang tumagal, mukang obvious na sakin ang mga dillema ng mga taong napapakisamahan ko, yung bang may alam na “real talk” for me, pero, nag-decide na lang na “ayawan” nalang ako, para sa so-called status quo na puno lang naman ng mga ka-bullshit-an nila. Introvert ako, kaya ko yon nalaman. Kahit implication at insinuation, nagagawa kong ma-anticipate, siguro, dahil sa long-time exposure ko sa betrayal tsaka sa disappointment ko, na naging real talk na sa mga mata ko. Aminado ako, nakaka-putang-ina lang talaga ang buhay on the time of this writing.

At times, kapag may mga ginagawa ako, sayang-sayang ako na somehow, independent akong magtrabaho. Kaso, may mga tao kasi na sadyang mga “try-hard advocate” sa so-called family work culture na sa suspetsa ko, yung bang, psychologically, gumagamit ng mga altruistic and collective concepts na dapat, “lahat tayo, pamilya dito”, “dapat, makisama ka”, “barkada ang turingan dito”, mga iba pang bullshit na pang-crowd-controlling, na ginagawa nang propagandistic! Subconsciously, eto ang nalalaman ko, tsaka, di naman ibig sabihin na evident to, for the least, na base lang to sa real-life experience ko. Ang babaw lang isipin na, sa speculation ko, mukang isang tool ang family work culture, like, ano to, katulad sa Japanese work culture na dapat maging “tapat” sa trabaho, most of the time, bilang respeto sa mga katrabaho pati mga boss? What the fuck’s going on? Baka tatanggapin ko pa yun kung ang magiging sweldo ko, is kayang mai-reciprocate ang effort ko, yung to the point na, masa-satisfy ang daily essential ko sa minimalistic kong lifestyle. Anyways, ano ba ang halaga ng family work culture kung lahat ng mga empleyado at ako, nagtatrabaho, for self-interest, di ba? Ang irony kasi dito, is, karamihan, nagsasama-sama para makinabang sila sa reward ng mga effort nila, na dapat kung may mapapala at napapala sila, go lang, otherwise, out na. No hard feelings.

Sa ibang pangyayari ng buhay ko, kailangan ko tuloy na mag-isip kung ano bang klaseng mga tao ba ang sadyang mapagkakatiwalaan na pwede kong gawing kakampi sa long-term life progression ko, pero sa ngayon, mukang hindi ako confident na sabihin ko na di sila maaasahan, lalo na sa panahon ngayon na karamihan, may pangagailangan na, by hook, or by crook. It’s a “doggie-dog world” ba naman, walang dala-dalawa, na magbabanat ng buto, makaraos lang. Sakin, todo tuloy lang pa rin, kahit kumakapit sa kokote ko ang mala-putang-inang negativity na gusto kong maialis, pero, you know what? I decide to to keep these, not into detriment, but to my fortitude. Syempre, laging vibrated ang kokote ko sa frustration, talagang magpapakatatag na lang ako para matupad ko anuman ang gusto ko. Ang iba, baka mag-isip na, “dapat, magpakukumbaba ako”, “dapat, wag mangontra kung di naman kailangan”, “dapat, wag maging solo”, pero sakin, relevant ba na maniwala ako? I don’t think so. Ano ba ang benefit ng mga “slogan” na yan sakin kung ang isang nakakataas, yung lang ang makikinabang the most? Siguro, economically, mag-i-improve ang stability ng kumpanya, pero, sa laylayan, na anjan ako, konti lang, kung tutuusin.

651,Effect of salary increase on COE prior to contract bond completion,"Sorry sa title, parang naging research paper HAHAHA


Hi to everyone! I'd like your opinions or insights on this. 

Let's say me and my colleagues are project-based employees in a known construction company. The thing is, we have a contract bond for two years in the company, with each of us having differing end dates (within a 6-month range).

Within these two years, may salary increase lang 'yung iba na about 5k (18 to 23) and 'yung iba 2k (23 to 25) within the first year. Those na 18k starting were fresh graduates or first job whereas 'yung mga 23k already had about 1 to 2 years exp prior to entering the company.

Our immediate superior mentioned before that our contracts were planned to be aligned to about 27k before our bond ends, and aabot lang ng 30k pagkapirma ng contract extension. This was the plan. Recently, our superior announced that only one appraisal per year was allowed (kahit siya naman yung nagdelay ng pag-asikaso ng papers namin for increase) and that the resolution with our CompBen HR was that wala na ang alignment for 27k and ""awaiting for signing"" na daw ang 30k at the end of our contract para sa extension papers.

Fellow colleagues also planned to leave the company mostly because of this reason (delay or miniscule amounts of increase due to our superior). Our job has a common 35k starting in other companies and hindi pa naman siya saturated so we assume that we are not being paid fairly compared to other companies. Even more disappointing is the fact that other teams in our department  already had their increase maxed out to 30k after their first year due to their respective team leads, which made us distrust our superior more.

So our question is, in the case na lumipat sila ng ibang company, will the COE be a critical document in salary negotiation? Due to the arrangement ng HR namin, it seems na parang gusto niya na ""wala kaming history na more than 25k sahod namin"" after our 2 year stint. Kung tatanungin, baka pagbasehan ang indicated salary namin sa COE for the offer and may be a basis for lowballing.

Will edit the post in case more info is needed. Please feel free to share more insights as well since we're not much aware of how HR and negotiation works (just like our current job na nauna work bago contract and JO haha).

I just had a meeting with my boss last week. Kinausap nila ako like evaluation sa lahat ng employees dito sa office namin (since ako daw pinakamatagal). Naopen ko sa kanila na hindi ko talaga kaya ang kaingayan ng HR. Understandable naman na may lagi silang for interview o kaya for Orientation,and it's really okay for me because it's their job, pero naopen ko kasi yung mga unnecessary chikas na ng dalawa naming HR at naiingayan talaga ako lalo na't audit season ngayon, saka hindi din talaga siya work related kaya dagdag inis sa akin na seryosong nagtatrabaho tas ang dami nilang time mag chika.

As the presentation goes, to my understanding, the salary package will be given to us piecemeal during the 6 month probation period. The basic is at 18k. Where's the rest? Locked behind ""milestones"" based on how long we've been in the company. And to top it all off, essentials such as Rice subsidies are locked away until after 3 months. Complexity bonus/account premiums will be given 2 months after initial start. To me, that just sounds way off course from what I was told in the initial interview.

This was the last straw after months of deliberate disrespect so I resigned. Tipong I will share that I was able to halt the order cancellation of one account, then LM just answered me na chamba. Dagdag pa na ‘yung wrong decisions nila na mag i-incur ng millions of pesos losses ang company na napababa ko to several thousands, then feedback uli sa’kin ay chamba. I was also able to start partnerships with respectable organizations in the industry our company is in tapos chamba pa rin ang sasabihin sa’kin tapos sa harap ng colleagues ko niya gagawin.

So nung Jan 22 ay nag-resign ako. Tapos LM was asking me to shorten my rendering period to Jan 25 kahit na my contract says I need to render 30 days. So to confirm LM’s instructions, I made an email seeking for confirmation. But LM gaslighted me by saying na it was never his instructions even though he was imposing me to send another resignation letter with new effectivity date, na advised niya.

After sending that email, LM immediately made an email announcing my resignation up to the external stakeholders. I somehow felt humiliated. Dagdag pa na LM created another story para siraan ako sa office kaya pagbalik ko sa office ay hindi na ako pinapansin ng buong team.

Sabi ko yung reason dahil buntis ako kaya ako umabsent kasi hindi okay pakiramdam ko. At dahil feeling nila aabsent daw ako after maternity leave kasi need ko pa raw alagaan baby ko.

492,Vacation Leave Cash Conversion Dispute After Resignation,"Hello mga master, I need advise lang regarding VL cash conversion dispute with my former employer.

&#x200B;

**Background:** We have annual Vacation Leaves of 15 days. For 2023, I only took 1 day VL. So I have remaining 14 days VL. I resigned from the company last Jan. 12, 2024.

**Issue:** Upon checking my last pay calculation, the VLs converted to cash were only 7.99 days. Saan yung remaining 7 days VL?

**HR Explanation: ""**Since you left the company January 12, 2024, company policy for the carry forward leaves and leave encashment shall apply. You have 15 days entitlement, so half of that 15 days shall be encashed (in your final pay) and the remaining shall be carried forward to next year, since merck does not encash carry forward leave it will be forfeited.""

**HR Article regarding VL:** 

https://preview.redd.it/4q2bsomkviic1.png?width=1191&format=png&auto=webp&s=58224d14a47361a24799aacb047b3db4f2b6b27f

In my point of view, magkabukod ang dalawang point ""**Non-usage of all VL credits**"" and ""**Employee Separation from the Company**"". So in my understanding, sa clause under ""Employee Separation from the Company"" applicable sakin since ako ay resign na, nabanggit na accumulated and unused vacation leave will be converted to cash.

Tanong ko lang, is valid argument ba yung niri-raise ko sa HR? May habol ba ako dito? Saang agency ako pwedeng lumapit para magcomplain regarding dito?

Thanks in Advance sa mga sasagot. God Bless.

Almost 11 years na ako dito sa company ko and hindi sila transparent sa bereavement beneficiary. As far as ai can remember, one time lang sila nagpost ng mga beneficiaries ilang beses na natanong sa townhall meetings. Tas ngayon wala na uli. Kapag nauungkat ang sinasabi lang ng HR ay “hindi naman pwede idisclose” and “di kaya ng konsensya ko iexploit(not the exact term pero parang ganto) na ilabas ang names ng mga namatayan” na parang what, anong masama dun? Fact yun tsaka mas malalaman ng empleyado kung sino ang dadamayan or para mas makapagabot ng mas malaking tulong. 

Ang kaltas samin ay 25 pesos per cut off. Minsan 20 lang, and mabibilang sa daliri yung wala talaga. This is mandatory contribution. According sa kanila, 5pesos per beneficiary daw and ang makakareceive ay ung namatayan ng immediate family(mukang strict sila dito kasi may kakilala ako di nabigyan kahit lola nya yung namatay). 

2022 or 2023 ginamit pa nila ang pandemic na kesyo madami daw namatay. Di ko alam kung may backlogs sila ng mga nagapply ng benefit pero paano yung pre pandemic? Ano dahilan nila dun? Ang issue ko dito is yung transparency. Sakin walang issue kahit 10/15 pa per head ang bawas para sa namatayan pero sana transparent. i believe na kahit cents lang ang binabawas mo dapat transparent ka sa mga tao mo.

510,Amendments to existing contract?,"Hi AntiworkPH!

We are currently having issues with our company regarding our working hours. We have yet to discuss it further with the management so we are refraining from reaching out to DOLE. But I just want to gather insights from anyone who has knowledge about it.

So our contract states that schedule of work is 48 hours but general schedule of work is monday to friday, 8 hours a day. So it sums up to 40 hours a week only. Our understanding was that we may be required to work overtime up to 48 hours if needed due to the nature of our work, but our understanding is that it would be paid overtime.

The company is now arguing that per the employee handbook, our work schedule is 48 hours a week, 6 days a week. So up until the 48 hours weekly, we are not entitled to overtime pay. Which contradicts the schedule in our contract.

Now they said that they have made an error in the contract and they would amend it to reflect the work schedule in the handbook.

By the way, they had us sign an acknowledgment for the handbook, said acknowledgement includes a clause that it may be changed from time to time at the company's discretion with or without notice to us.

Is this clause allowed? Given that they are claiming that the work schedule in the handbook should be followed instead of the contract? So what prevents them from claiming that other clauses in the handbook would prevail over the contract, and that they can make changes to the handbook anytime?

Another thing is, if they do provide a new contract and I refuse to sign it, what would happen to me? Would I be forced to resign? Should I immediately stop work if I don't agree to the new terms since they migjt argue that since I am continuing to work, I am agreeing to the new terms?

Sometimes the realization hits during JO, but on worst-case, it hits when you're already hired inside the company.

For example, company's reputation is that it has tenured people and has fun work environment. after you've been hired, it turns out that the company has no work-life balance and mostly run by boomers

521,My minimum wage job is slowly getting to me.,"I'm a computer engineer grad but due to some personal stuff kasama na ang financial at mental problems, di ako nakahanap agad ng trabaho.

I lowered my pride and applied as a warehouse staff. Maayos ang trabaho, maglilinis lang ng mga box na paglalagyan ng pinagmoldan na parts. Pwera sa bagay katulad ng terror na ""bawat piso sa sahod ay dapat worth it"" manager, ulagang pagpapasahod, HR na design lang, at mga kasamang tumutulog.

That is, until Wednesday. By principle, di ako natutulog at first and last time na sinubukan ko, muntikan na ako matanggal eh on call status pa lang ako. Inaayos ko na lang ang area ko para di na kami pumasok pa ng linggo. That nighshift, palabas lang ako nang palabas ng nga kailangang boxes na, sa 2 hours ( 15 minutes sa 9,1 hour break, 15 minutes sa 2, 30 minutes sa 4 king mag oOT ka) na break ko, 28 minutes lang nagamit ko. Madami ding time na naghahallucinate ako. The last straw was noong tinawag ako ng manager ko at yun nga, nakaligtaan ko yung isang box. Lumong lumo na ako habang yung mga kasama ko patawa tawa na lang.

Papasok sana ako kagabi pero dahil may naiwan ako at nalate na ako, di na ako tumuloy. Pagkabalik ko, yung isa sa kasama ko nagsabi, ""Bakit di ka pumasok kagabi, nalugi tuloy si ___"".
Mas lalo pa akong nagalit dahil mga 4 lang na boxes ang requested sa area ko ngayon pero nagsabi pa ang isa na ""Oh ito. Ito lang ang kailangan mong boxes"". Gusto pa ata nila tumulong ako sa kanila eh hindi na nga ako nakapagpahinga noong last Wednesday at saka lang sila tumulong sa akin dahil inutos.

Sinasabi ko sa sarili ko na para maexperience ko kumbaga ang hirap ng minimum wage ay maaappreciate ko kapag may trabaho na akong mas maganda, but man, sobrang nakakaputang ina ang ganito.",38,11,0.97,True,Story 🗣️,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/1as8fih/my_minimum_wage_job_is_slowly_getting_to_me/,2024-02-16 21:20:28,1as8fih
522,how to heal from your former work trauma?,"I recently resigned from my job because I decided na I needed to finish my study first. And it's a great timing since di na kami okay ng manager ko. We were close before, we ate a lot sa labas. But then she decided to put hate on me. I asked and confronted her A LOT OF TIMES  kung anong problema, if there are areas I need to improve. All I get was a silent treatment. That's when I passed my resignation. I rendered 15days and those days, never kaming nagpansinan.   Grabeng experience yun, mabigat sa pakiramdam.

 I was super angry when my former co-worker said na the reason she puts hate on me kasi sobrang slow ko daw at mahinhin sa work. When in fact, I did asked her before. Umiyak pa nga ako sa harap niya since I am so frustrated with the silent treatment. Ang sabi niya lang, KSP ba daw ako at need niya ako pansinin lagi. But then she silent bullied me in front of my other colleagues. 

It's been 2 weeks since my last day at work and I cannot stop thinking about what happened pa din. It gets in my brain and I am so pathetic to cry over it. I get it, she don't like my vibe.

523,I did something courageous,"I submitted my resignation tonight. I was diagnosed with a mood disorder, and of course iba-iba yung mood swings ko, wala akong middle, it is either ups or down. Before my diagnosis, nararamdaman ko naman nang hindi ako belong sa workplace, na parang ineexclude ako, and di ako kakausapin.  I consulted with a psychiatrist, and prescribed a medicine for my case. Akala ko ok na ako, nakakabond na ako with my workmates. Pero weeks after that, nabalik na naman sa dati, tumaas yung dosage ng gamot ko. Instead na nababawasan, nadadagdagan. Until nagkaron ng confrontation with me and my immediate supervisor. Pinag-uusapan pala talaga nila ako, akala ko delusion ko lang yung mga nararamdaman ko. Pero totoo pa lang pinag uusapan ako, sabi nila, iniintindi daw nila ako pero di daw nila ako maintindihan. Sinabi pa nung immediate supervisor ""First time lang kasi namin magkaron ng workmate na diagnosed, hindi namin kaya ihandle yung mood swings. May kaniya kaniya tayong baggage"" gets ko naman na may kaniya-kaniya tayong baggage, pero the moment na sinabi niyang hindi nila ako kaya ihandle, wala naman akong ginagawa, it just so happen na nagmomood swings ako, pero yung output ko with work, okay pa rin. I can work, pero hindi kp naman ginusto na nagkikick minsan yung depression. Pinag uusapan nila ako sa work, to the point na ineexclude na nila ako. So ayon, nagresign and HR niyo :) kasi sabi ng mga Co-HR ko na mga psych graduates with licenses, eh hindi daw nila ako kaya ihandle. Di niyo naman ako need ihandle, pakisamahab niyo lang ako na parang tao, ok ako. Akala ko kasi kapag nilatag ko concern ko sa HR Officer, magkakaron ng resolution, pero ang nangyari is clpsure lang.

527,Reported a case of microagression at work,"This happened nung pumasok ako sa office around a week ago. I usually use motorbike hailing apps (Angkas, MoveIt, Joyride) pa-office. Then ‘yung rider, in an attempt to have a conversation with me, asked some personal questions (e.g., may girlfriend ka na ba? Ilang taon ka na? Siguro nasa (insert amount) nas sweldo mo, no?). Needless to say it was an unpleasant 25-minute ride with him.

When I arrived at the office, nabanggit ko ‘yung experience ko about the rider. Then itong isang colleague ko (not even a teammate) jumped in and jokingly said, “Baka kasi nakayakap ka sa rider kaya ganun ‘yung mga tanon.”

[Context: I’m part of the G in the LGBTQIA+ community]

There were 2 more colleagues na natawa sa joke, but i’m sure it was just a jerk reaction. As for me, I was caught off guard; nasabi ko na lang, “Uy hindi, ah. Merong handle sa likod ‘yung motor and dun ako kumakapit.” Take note that we’re not really close and most of the time ‘yung interactions namin (small talk) is ako pa nagi-initiate and work-related madalas.

Since that happened, I’ve been thinking about that incident and nabo-bother talaga ako. Parang with how I had told my experience, how did he come up with the assumption na nakayakap ako sa rider? Then it me, I just became a victim of microagression. This is the first time in my entire career na nangyari ito. 

Now kanina lang, for my peace of mind, I decided to bring it up to the site lead. He acknowledged naman what happened; he also asked some questions to further put context to it. 

Sa part ko naman, I made it clear na i don’t want to reprimand the person kasi i know it was accidental (he prolly want to make a joke about what happened but it was in bad taste). So sabi ko it would be best to just remind the person. 

The site lead said na we (even s’ya) should take the weekend to think about what I want to do next, and then next week we will meet again to finalize the action plan.

My TAKEAWAY FROM THIS EXPERIENCE: Shet, you’ll never know how it feels until it happens to you talaga. I had some sleepless nights just thinking about it. Malaking pasalamat ko na lang that we have a great feedback culture kasi kung hindi baka sarilinin ko na lang ‘to. Hopefully, the site lead and I will arrive at a sound action plan kasi I want to move on from it na rin.

529,I can't wait to resign,"Long post ahead, sobrang gigil lang ako talaga. 

I do not work for a BPO, but I do work in a contact center for a local bank. I've been on the post for more than a year, and honestly, I want to fucking leave. Naghahanap naman na ako ng malilipatan, it just so happens na di ako makapag-pasa since I'm still waiting on a good offer. The bills ain't paying themselves at walang generational wealth ang family ko for me to resign ng wala pang new work.

It used to be okay naman. Tbh, I really do not like taking calls. I freaking hate what I do. But for experience and to keep myself afloat, I took the offer kasi desperado na ako. When I was looking for jobs nung 2022, ito lang yung tumanggap sa akin and mababait kasi yung managers ko during my interview. Hindi ko na kayang ma-tengga any longer so I took the risk and accepted the offer kahit na sobrang baba nung basic. Nakakabawi lang because maganda benefits nung bank, but even so, sobrang underpaid namin. 

We're open 24/7, kahit na wala namang international clients masyado tapos shifting sched pa. Nag-gy na ako so I know na ang unnecessary ng gy shift kasi legit na ilang piraso lang tumatawag and yung mga concerns ng clients pwede namang makapaghintay by the morning. Tapos nagdagdag pa sila ng 6am to 3pm at 4pm to 1am 🤷🏻‍♀️ Before, mahirap na mag-file ng leaves. If meron kang kasama na di makakapasok, they have to look for someone to cover that person's shift. Tapos may policy rin na if nag-SL ka you have to work on a rest day to make up for it. Like I said, di kami BPO, pero it feels like that. Not entirely sure kung ganito rin sa BPO, so don't come for me.

Before 2023 ended, they hired this new officer. Hindi pa siya nakakapasok, nagsisimula na magbago yung ihip ng hangin. Dami na agad changes sa house rules na sobrang wala namang sense. Clean desk policy kuno pero yung mga officers ang daming gamit sa table. Yung mga may pedestal bawal itabi sa kanila, officers lang pwede. Tapos manda OT every fucking week. Ang bilis bilis magpa-OT, pero ang damot damot magpa-leave at SL. We have a target kasi na we have to meet at least 80% answer level every day para makapasa kami end of month. What can we do? Wala pa kaming 30 na agents overall. Sa isang araw wala pa ata kaming 15 na nag-ccalls. Paano namin aabutin yung desired AL kung kulang kami sa tao? OT daw sagot nila eh kahit naman mag-OT kaming lahat sa isang araw, di talaga kaya yon. Dumadami na yung clients ng bank pero kami ganon pa rin. Nag-hhire naman daw sila pero pa-isa isa lang. Paano, ang baba ng offer. Tatanggapin mo lang yun if sobrang desperado mong kumita ng pera like me. Nasilaw kasi ako doon sa 16 mos namin lol pero kulang na kulang pa rin talaga. 

I am writing this post kasi sobrang sama ng loob ko. Bigla akong nagsuka kahapon and nagtae (TMI). I really don't know why kasi okay naman ako before coming to work. We have this break sched na we strictly have to follow, kasi if hindi i-ccrucify ka nila (joke lang). So my shift yesterday was from 10 am to 7pm. Lunch ko was at 2pm. Before ako magpa-init ng food ko, I had to do number 2, so I already knew something was off tapos bigla akong nawalan ng gana. It could have been because of something I ate pero wala naman kasi akong kinain na foreign sa akin. After forcing myself to finish my baon, I went to the comfort room and sinuka ko lahat ng kinain ko. I immediately advised my TL na di ako okay and if pwede bang umuwi na lang muna ako. He told me to go to the clinic first and ask for meds. So I did, and sabi nung doctor baka raw acid reflux so they gave me meds for that. I went back to the cr and nagsuka na naman ako and number 2. It was much worse this time. Ininom ko na yung mga gamot after doing my thing and messaged my TL again, telling him na hindi ko na talaga kaya. When I got back sa station ko, di muna ako nag-in agad kasi I was waiting for them to tell me if uuwi na ba ako or not. They were interviewing someone kaya natagalan, so nairita ako, nag-calls muna ako. Tas sobrang bad trip ko na kasi it's not my fault na bigla akong nagsusuka. Hindi ko rin naman kasalanan na sumama ang pakiramdam ko?

I rarely take absences even when I was a student kasi wala namang reason for me to be absent. Nung gs and hs ako, perfect attendance ako lagi. As in isang school year di ako nag-aabsent unless need na need talaga. I come to work on time pero for them late na yon kasi dapat at least 30 minutes before ng shift mo nandoon ka na. I am working on it. Lagi akong pumapasok, kahit na medyo di ako okay, pumapasok ako. 

Going back, after their interview, nag-reply na yung tl ko na nag-clinic na raw ba ako. Nakakaloka!!! Tapos sinabihan ako na mag rest muna tas balik ako after an hour. Sabi ko titiisin ko na lang kasi anong oras na non. But they insisted na mag-stop muna ako mag-calls since they were already asking approval from the new annoying boss kung pwede ba akong pauwiin. So nandoon ako sa likod ng office nagpapahinga. After 10-15 minutes lumapit yung TL ko at pinapauwi na ako kasi baka raw today ako hindi makapasok. Concern nila yung AL kasi weekend so critical. Mas inuna pa yung AL kesa sa health ko, okay sige. So di na ako nagpatumpik tumpik pa, bumalik ako sa station ko at nag-log out na ako at umuwi. Ang sama pa ng tingin nung inbound head namin na akala mo pumatay ako. Pero pag sila yung di okay, onting kibot lang leave agad. Fucking bullshit. 

So I booked my Move It and habang nasa daan, nasusuka na naman ako ulit. Sabi ko buti na lang pala umuwi ako. Di ko pala siya kayang tiisin. When I got home, it was a complete disaster. Tapos I started getting mild fever at sobrang awful talaga ng pakiramdam ko. I didn't want to eat anything kasi I lost my appetite and sure ako na isusuka ko lang din lahat. Tubig, gatorade, onting lugaw, at gamot lang laman ng tiyan ko. Nagsabi na ako last night na baka di ako makapasok kasi ang sama pa rin talaga ng pakiramdam ko and I'll observe muna if kaya ko pumasok the next day (which is today)

I woke up around 4am at nagsuka na naman ako. Pag-check kong phone ko, nag-reply na pala yung TL ko at parang kasalanan ko talaga na di ako okay. Kaya raw pinayagan ako umuwi kahapon para makapasok ako today. Ay sorry naman po at di ako si Superman na kryptonite lang ang weakness. Pasensya naman at inuuna ko lang ang health ko na karapatan ko namang di pumasok kahit pa na RD ko tom hanggang monday. Eh di ko talaga kaya pumasok? Para saan pa yung sl credits ko? Decoration? Puta lang 😅 send ko kaya sa kanila picture ng suka ko. 

I'll end it here. Nakakainis sobra. If you made it this far, thanks for taking the time to read. Sana talaga makahanap na akong better offer para masampal ko na sa mga pagmumukha nila resignation ko. Ang babasura ng mga ugali nila doon. Walang consideration sa mga employees nila eh kami yung bumubuhay sa unit na yon.

Here are the key factors sa pagreresign ko

Trainer: Well wala naman akong problema sa trainer ko pero lagi nalang ako pinag-iinitan kapag nakakagawa ng simple pagkakamali, parang nagiging micro- manager. Minsan hindi nga maayos magturo (Honestly). Parang ako lang lagi pinagtataniman ng galit pero pag sa iba naman siya magalit, may pang-unawa or binebaby sila knowing na bago kaming lahat at ako lang nakakaranas ng ganon. Ginagamit niya pang excuse yung pagiging prangka niya pero may borderline bullying and discrimination na yung ginagawa niya.   


Supervisor: May supervisor talaga na mahilig mang-power trip pero buti nalang umalis na rin sila pero hindi namin maiwasan may maiiwan na ayaw namin talaga. Nalaman ko rin na yung isang supervisor namin ay may kapit or protected from upper management kaya kahit ipaglaban mo or I- call out pagkakamali ng supervisor, sumbong kaagad sa upper management. Minsan bully rin ibang yan pero hindi ko nalang pinapansin.  


Overwork- Halos everyday na nangyari sa akin yan. Kahit nung first day ko, OT agad ako kasi walang papalit sa akin. Minsan pa nga mahigit 12 hours ako sa trabaho and kinukulit nila ako na mataas nanaman sahod ko (Sa totoo lang, nakakairita at umay pakinggan mga salitang yan.)

536,Finally resigning,"I posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/adultingph/s/0btT6qUt0J) on adultingph more than a month ago and finally, I’m resigning!

I work for a big and known corporation and it’s sooo toxic there! The culture stems from the upper management kaya it’s hard to do something about it. Borderline abusive ang mga bosses, no boundaries na on weekends you are expected to work and reply to their messages. There was an instance na nag-email at 9pm and requesting for a meeting asap over something na hindi naman urgent. So much politics too to the point na hindi mo matanggihan work na hindi pasok sa JD mo because mapapaginitan ka talaga. 4-5 months pa lang ako sa company and yet there’s so much damage done to my mental health kaya immediate resignation ako, backed by a medical certificate from my psychiatrist since I was also diagnosed with anxiety triggered by work. It’s sooo not worth my mental health to stay there despite the good compensation package, I dread going to work daily because of the people and environment there. Thankful rin ako sa privilege ko na I have enough savings to support me and my family for the next 2-3 months while I’m taking a break so I can recover.

Health is wealth talaga. Now I know better than magtiis sa mga companies na di marunong rumespeto sa mga empleyado.

EDIT: For those asking for the company, please message me na lang. As much as I want to namedrop, very powerful ang owners and I’ve heard stories about their capabilities when it comes to stuff like this.

539,Company forced me to resign because I am pregnant pt. 2,"Thank you po sa advice nyo. Well, sinunod ko naman yung advice nyo na pumunta ng DOLE at magtanong sa lawyer (may bayad pa ang consultation fee huhu) nagmamadali din kasi ako sa legal advice. Hehe.

So pumasok po ako kanina sa office for turnover, akala ko may tuturuan akong bago e wala pa palang kapalit sa akin. So dapat ngayon ko marereceived yung remaining na sahod ko na di nabigay sa akin nung feb 15. Binigay agad sakin ng owner ng company yung COE ko. Wala naman akong pinirmahan na nareceived ko sya kaya iniwan ko sa table ko. Until 5PM contemplating ako kung ipapasa ko yung retraction ng resignation ko, dahil antagal ng quitclaim. Ang ending pinababalik ako bukas para magpirma nun kasi bukas na din daw idedeposit. Natetense na talaga ako dahil panay chat sakin ang asawa ko asking kung pinareceived ko na yung letter. I was like wala pa. 

Kinausap ako nung isang manager namin na kasamang kumausap sakin para ihatid yung good news nilang iteterminate ako nung wednesdays. I asked him na ano mangyayari pag hindi ako nagresign. Baka daw bigyan akong NTE. I was like NTE e immidiate ang termination tapos bibigyan nyoko ng NTE. Nagdesisyon na sila na ilet go ako tapos NTE.  Sabi nya sana daw in-inform ko sila agad na buntis ako para daw nilaban ako kasi bago ko pa daw sabihin e balak na daw iterminate ako dahil nga sa absences/leaves. Sabi ko sir yung pagsabi ko o pag inform kong buntis ako, e 3 months na ang tyan ko bago ko pa lang din nalaman, hindi ba enough yun na yun ang dahilan ng pag absent ko. Sabi nakapagdesisyon na daw kasi yung owner kaysa naman daw na iterminate ako na wala akong makukuha. 

Pwede ba yun magterminate na lang basta basta without due process dahil napatunayan nilang valid na iterminate ako? Nagbabasa ako dito sa antiwork, syuta buti sila nabibigyan ng NTE samantalang ni kausapin ako for warnings wala man lang. Ang nakakainis labor lawyer sila na dapat alam nila. Ano pa ba reason nila na mahihirapan daw sila maghanap ng ka relyebo ko na magstay lang ng 3 months. Kung sana daw may ipapalit ako na payag sa ganung setup. Like ako pa pala mamomoblema nun. 

Tsaka pasensya na sa boss ko kung hindi ko nasagot agad ang tawag mo dahil sa nagpapahinga ako dahil masama lang naman pakiramdam ko kakasuka, kaya atat na atat kang iterminate ako.

540,Am I been sabotaged at work,"little bit fresh grad with previous wotking experiences. I want to post again regarding my stay at this recent company. I was not regularized in a chinese company that I was working with for less than 3 months. Since then, my boss didn't message nor told me of what am I going to do. Never messaged me directly even telling about my performance before my supposedly end of my probation. His other assistant (who also happened to evaluated me, never told me before the end of my contract regarding my poor performance. She seems like didn't me as important as other people. She also seems to indirectly participate on those people who give me back handed compliments and insults as they treat it as a joke. I've never been in a proper training wherein the boss or co workers will teach me the step by step process and what are the purpose of each files. I just able to know things when I asked. But some people doesn't like being asked a few more times. 

When I was leaving the company, people seems to joke about my farewell. It's really insulting. 

As a person who had been partially diagnosed with mental disorder, I needed to know things first before knwing the flow of the task as I am meticulous. But what happened is people don't like being being bothered  in a place that I don't know what to do. I also decide on own if ever that they dont respond to me, but when things go wrong. They are always there to criticize me. I'm assesing things na kulang sa akin when I am creating mistakes and what are the causes of those mistakes. I always smile and trying my best to understand each person at work but I'm still getting hurt by them. Tried to ask one of them but told me that I'm weird because I ask a lot when on the first place they didn't explain to me further. Chinese people also have been very bad nung pinahiya nila ako nung di ko alam na yung task is out of my skills already and when I am just clarifying htings like meeting since we dont have domain.

It is really hard to paper trail everything as the company doesn't have domain.

Right before my last day. They told that there is no need for turn over as they have been told by the boss that it is what is. Then, they suddenly told me why I didn't submit my files and might hold the last pay. 

I am still thankful for the people who secretly supported me at work. I'm guilty as I'm not able to say proper thank you once again.

What are your thoughts and advices. Thank you.

542,Cleansing of offenses per year.,"Cleansing/Refresh di ko alam kung ano po tamang term. Pasensya na po. Hehe.

&#x200B;

Nasa batas po ba natin na every year ay naccleanse po ang number of offense ng mga employee po?

Ang scenario po kasi is last year po etong si company bigla pong nag pa announce na kapag nagkaroon ka ng 2 unpaid leave (ubos na ang leave credits dahil 5 SIL per year lang) po per month bibigyan ka nila ng warning letter. Or any type of leave po, possible na bigyan ka ng warning letter. And kapag po nagkaroon ka ng 5 warning letter sa loob ng isang taon, for termination na po. So last year, etong kaibigan ko po nagkaroon po siya ng 4 na warning letter, nagexpect po siya macclear na siya for this year. This month po bigla pong sinabi na hindi marerefresh ung number of offense niya. Sa tagal po ng stay namin sa company ngayon lang po nangyari to. Ang pagkakaalam ko din po kasi kahit sa mga previous work ko, macclear ung number of offense mo per year pero hindi siya mawawala sa record mo. Pero kung sakali na magkaroon ka ng offense pag tapak ng panibagong taon magiging 1st warnig na lang ulit siya.

543,Should I report my company to DOLE?," My company, a manufacturing company has been witholding everyone's 13th month pay due to ""lack of funds"". Like we have been down on operations since September and my job is being affected as being a data analyst, I barely or have no data to work with. The first three months after the down-time I was helping interns but the interns left and I have been doing basically nothing these past two months. I told my boss about my work but he keeps forgetting.

However that is not the problem now. The problem is that the company has been witholding everyone's 13th month pay. December pa I'm supposed to get it but it is feb and wala pa! I keep asking the operations head when activities will resume and he still said ""Hindi ko alam"". i asked the HR head about the 13th month pay and she still said ""Wala pa"". At this point I am job hunting because I just hate how bad the management is in the down-time. I gets na every manufacturer can have periods of inactivity and dormancy pero I imagined it only to last for 2 months, NOT 5 MONTHS AND ONGOING! PLUS NO 13th MONTH PAY PA! EHH WHAT IF I WANT TO RESIGN!

Now the reason I am doubtful of reporting this to DOLE is because, I got this job through my dad's friend. There was a time I thought I would get delayed in University due to thesis and I did not want one subject to deny me entry to the workforce (I mean having white collared jobs with a degree required). I decided to ask my dad if he has friends to give me an entry-level job despite me still being a student. He used his networking and he found a friend of his who has a manufacturing company and I just got a job there. I managed to graduate naman pero I feel that utang ng loob mentality because I did not get the job through normal means. Basically my dad's friend owns the company, took me in despite me still being a college student and I feel the Utang ng loob mentality thing and it prevents me from reporting the 13th month pay issue to DOLE.",3,3,0.8,True,Advice Needed 🤔,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/1av475v/should_i_report_my_company_to_dole/,2024-02-20 08:48:39,1av475v

Nagkita kami nung isang staff sa kabila last monday tas may nakwento sya saakin. Tinanong daw sya nung training coach nila dun kung kilala daw ba ako, ""yung staff na astang bisor sa kabila"" sabi. 

Natawa ako kasi di ko pa naman naman nameet yung training coach sa kabila panu sya nagkarun ng ganung comment sakin. Ako yung tipo ng empleyado na di nakikifriend sa mga workmates, and nakikialam sa mga isyu nila sa buhay. So pinag isipan ko kung anong gagawin sa ganung comment noh. Although i dont really care kung anuman sinasabi nila sakin pero gusto ko icall out yung chismis just to let the know na alam ko na pinagchichismisan nila ako, para lang din iintimidate lang sila. haha

So ito na nga, kinaumagahan nung pauwi na ako at nasa pantry yung training coach sa branch namin tas yung 2 sa kawork ko tunanong ko si training coach kung sino yung training coach sa kabila. Sabi ko ""pinagchichismisan nyo pala ako noh?"", at sinabi ko yung context nung kwento sakin ng staff sa kabila. 

Nakita ko yung gulat sa mga mata nya, sabi nya wala naman daw syang kinukwento doon. Sabi ko naman wala naman akong pakialam kung anong tingin nyo sakin, ginagawa ko naman ng maayos trabaho ko, go lang kayo chumismis. And i left. 

I felt proud of myself actually, feeling ko naachieve ko yung goal na wag maging defensive at the same time icall out yung chismis.

But, suddenly pag datung ko ng bahay tumawag yung staff sa kabila. Kinausap daw sya nung training coach nila. A matter of misunderstanding daw. It was meant to be a compliment daw kasi. Magaling daw ako magtrabaho na kaya akong iwan ng bisor parang sa bisor na daw yung quality ng work ko. 

Andami kong tawa. Di ko alam kung totoong compliment talaga yun or binago lang yung kwento dahil sa pagmamaldita ko. Sinabi lang ba na i was meant to be a compliment kasi nicall out ko yung chismisan nila or it was really a compliment and i was asshole? haha.

563,Supervisor won't give me my holiday off,"Context: I am currently working as a nurse sa isang govt hospital in Manila. Technically, hindi bayad ang holiday duty namin instead offset ang kapalit nito. 

I've been working in this hospital for almost six months and I recently submitted my resignation letter kasi di na kaya ng mental and physical health ko ang working conditions (nurse-patient ratio is usually 1:15-20 considering na nasa ward pa kami niyan. Bukod pa ang intubated at critical patients na hawak mo. Tapos unhealthy din ang shifting schedule. Etc etc) 

So ayun na nga, effectivity ng resignation ko is mid March. I told my supervisor na baka next week na ako mag last day of work kasi gusto ko gamitin ung earned vacation leave credits ko at holiday offset. She blatantly told me na I can't use my accumulated holiday offset kasi bago daw ako and apparently new staff cannot use their holiday off until after 5-6 months. I told her na I still have 5-6 days of accumulated holiday offset since October and hindi ko daw pwede yun magamit before I resign. Sobrang unfair nito sa part ko kasi I worked my ass off during those holidays and di ko naman hiningi yun. She's reiterating na pag binigay niya saken yung holiday off na yun unfair daw sa mga bago na di niya binigyan ng holiday off. I told her na resigned na ako at ano yun thank you na lang? 

May mga government employees ba dito? Please enlighten me kasi ginagawa akong tanga nitong bisor ko. It's my right naman as an employee to have all those hard-earned holiday off considering na hindi naman kami bayad doon.

565,Legal Help needed.," 

Hi. Need suggestion/s and/or advice po regarding my past job. 

So I worked as a sales in this company pero nagresign na ako last year. Ang nature of business ng company ay fabrication. What happened is after ilang months na resigned na ko, kinocontact ako ng past clients ko na may problem sa projects in which I contacted the company I used to work for but they are not offering any solution sa clients regarding sa projects na yun. Ang mali ko dito is ako yung nakapirma sa documents, kaya ako yung liable, pero yung pera na downpayment ay nakuha ng company. Now they are denying my employment and their connection sa projects na yun even though aware yung clients na nakipag transact sila sa company na yun at hindi lang sa akin. I have proofs and all pero kasi ang ginawa ko nung times na yun, inuna kong tapusin ang projects kesa sa ireklamo sila since napaka passive nila and unfair, para ma clear ang name ko. 

Sa mga lawyers po dito marami din po sana akong tanong, wala na din po kasi akong pera para kumuha ng lawyer 📷 halos 150k+ po nagastos ko para tapusin yung projects na yun. Sana po may makapag bigay ng advice since di ko na alam gagawin ko, sobrang nakaka depress ng ganito.

567,FINALLY 🥹,"Not sure if this is the right sub, but I just want to share what happened today at work. I finally tendered my resignation!!! I recently posted on this sub about how toxic our management has become, and how I couldn't wait to resign. Today, I finally did 🥹

On Monday, I got an email for my JO with one of the companies I applied to. It took two weeks for them to get back to me and I actually thought di na ako ma-cconsider for the role. I also had 2 interviews that day tapos after ng mga yon, nanghingi akong sign kasi ayoko na talaga sa current job ko. Then I received an email regarding my job offer minutes later. At first, na-overwhelm ako kasi na-realize ko na medyo alanganin pala yung pag-apply ko. Bonus na kasi ng April and since natagalan yung job offer, I thought, why not just wait it out until then. Pero ayun nga nag-email na sila nung Monday. Naisip ko rin na wag muna tanggapin kasi if di okay ang offer, then I'll keep looking pa. Sa sobrang stress ko kasi, simula November 2023, nag-update akong resume ko para by January, makapag-apply na ako. Nagda-dalawang isip pa nga ako last month pero every time na merong di okay na mangyari sa office, nag-aapply ako pag-uwi. Parang every time I come in to that office and start my day, answering calls (CSR ako), lagi akong nabibigyan ng hundred reasons to leave. Everyday kong na-rrealize na hindi talaga siya para sa akin and hindi ko na kayang tumagal pa. Ang baba rin kasi ng sahod so bakit pa ako mag-ssuffer. The universe heard me and ito na yung sign na hiningi ko, yung matagal ko ng hinihintay. Buti na lang talaga na okay na okay yung offer sa akin. Upgrade talaga siya sa current compensation ko. I still have a long way to go, pero ganon naman diba, you really have work your way up to get better things. 

It was bittersweet, if I'm being honest, kasi I'm very close with my teammates and other officemates. Napalapit na rin ako sa kanila and ang sad lang na di ko na sila makikita everyday once I leave. Meron din akong work bestie na kasabay ko nung trainee days ko. We went through a lot together and siya talaga ang pinaka-mamimiss ko. But I have to choose myself and I will always keep choosing myself. Promise ko sa sarili ko this year na i-pprioritize ko na yung needs ko, lalong lalo na if involved ang work. If hindi ko na talaga gusto yung ginagawa ko, or toxic na talaga, I have to do something about it. So I'm really proud of myself for finally resigning because it took a lot of courage. Swerte ko lang din kasi I was able to find a new job kahit na Feb pa lang. Mahirap maghanap ng trabaho lalo na for a career shifter like me. Di rin naman ako privileged enough to resign and saka lang maghahanap ng bago. Hopefully, yung lilipatan ko magiging okay siya. It's a completely different role so I'll have to start from 0 ulit. But I do have a really good feeling about this one. Really looking forward to this new beginning. 

Just really wanted to share this big win for me! Kapagod maging corpo slave no? Gusto ko na lang maging Disney princess for real hahahaha

 If you're looking for a sign to resign, baka ito na yon! Go mo na yan 🤪

568,Giving Reviews after leaving a Company? Do it! Really helps for those job seekers,"**INTRO muna:** Kung ganado ka naman magbasa at magsulat, sana huwag ka na rin tamarin sa pagbigay ng reviews or ratings sa mga previous company mo.

So, share ko lang... Alam ko na konti lang talaga gumagawa nito pero sana, dumami na kasi malaking tulong siya talaga. Kung gumagawa kayo ng LinkedIn, Jobstreet, Indeed, Glassdoor, or kung ano-ano or saan pang mga Job Hiring Site, try niyo na rin mag-effort na magbigay ng reviews, especially kung negative or bad reviews pa nga 'yan sa mga previous company niyo.

Ako kasi ginawa ko siya sa lahat ng mga previous company ko. Nilagay ko talaga yung salary ko roon, pros and cons. Napakarami sa cons talaga. Bawal company, sinabi ko talaga na yung cons and bad experiences ko. Sa good kasi, I don't know, kahit maganda yung company konti lang talaga nasabi ko kasi nga, parang yung mga magaganda na 'yon, bare minimum and common at basic naman na dapat sa isang company culture. Pero yung sa cons? Since, iba-iba work experiences ko, iba-iba rin nasabi ko. As in, elaborated. Masyado na kasi gasgas kung ang sasabihin ko lang *toxic management, delayed salary, no healthcard, powertripping colleagues, entitled tenured* halos lahat naman kasi may ganyan talaga. As in, sinabi ko talaga bad experiences ko sa mga department, ganito-ganyan, hindi maasahan yung department na 'to sa ganito kahit trabaho naman nila 'yon, mga ganyang bagay ba.

Nung panahong naghahanap ako ng work, as much as possible, chine-check ko talaga sa kung saan-saan makabasa lang talaga ako ng reviews sa company na binabalak ko apply-an that time.

Ako talaga, bilang ganti ko sa mga previous company ko, halos lahat may bad experiences ako, ang ginawa ko talaga sa halos lahat ng mga pwede ako magbigay ng reviews, nagbigay talaga ako. Kasi alam kong may nagbabasa talaga especially kung higher position. Pero sana kahit hindi higher, maglagay pa rin kayo.

Anonymous naman kasi tayo roon, walang makakaalam na tayo ang nagbigay ng bad feedback. Unless, masyadong obvious like kung paano ka mag-type, mag-english or nabanggit mo yung mga details na masyadong obvious na sarili mo tinutukoy mo.

570,SSS Sickness Benefit Late Filing Issue,"SSS Sickness Benefit

Hello, question lang po. May issue lng po kasi ako regarding ng late filing sa sss dahil matagal na process ng accounting namin.

Bale po ganito yung timeline ng nangyari:

Dec 23: requested to bed rest dahil high-risk pregnancy. Nasubmit ko on time lahat ng requirements at na-forward ko sa HR at accounting na din. Bali 1 month bed rest yung required ko Dec 23 to Jan 19

Jan 3: dyan pa nila na notify yung sss kahit ilang beses akong nag-follow up sa kanila at nag-remind regarding na within 5 days lang dapat ang notification para hindi ma tag as “late filing”

Jan 19: na reject ng medical evaluation kasi dapat magsubmit ng certified true copy na ultrasound, which is hindi mn lang nag confirm yung hr or accounting na needed yun kahit tinanong ko sila ng paulit-ulit if needed ba. So ayun since na-reject, agad ko namang sinubmit yung kulang na requirements at finorward ko sa kanila. Then sa time na din nito, inextend pa din ang bed rest ko Jan 20 to Feb 19. So sinend ko nalang din yung requirements for second SN filing para isang galawan nalang.

Jan 25: dyan pa nila na notify uli sila sa first SN ko at second SN.

Feb 12: nag notify yung SSS na approve na daw for advance payment yung first SN ko, pero hindi nagbigay ng advance payment yung employer ko. Then yung second SN naman, rejected dahil hindi pa na settle yung first. So agad kong ni-notify yung hr at accounting about it when ma-reimburse yung advance payment pero walang response sa kanilang end kahit ilang follow-up na ang nangyari.

Feb 21: naka receive ako ng email ng SSS na ipa-confirm ko daw yung advance payment na na-receive (30 days count; which is wala naman talaga ni piso) at nakita kong 8 days lng yung babayran for reimbursement sa employer ko instead na 30 days dahil nga daw late nag file. Nag inquire ako nito, then sabi ng accounting na dapat ko i confirm daw para ma-receive yung reimbursement. Pero ang ending yung 8 days lng ang maibibigay dahil nga late.

Nag-reklamo ako na unfair sa part ko na mag acknowledge na naka receive nga daw ako nga advance payment (which is **,*** then yung ibibigay lng pala nila is *,*** if nag approve ako). Hindi mn lang half sa supposedly na matatanggap ko.

Ano po ba ang pwede kong gawin neto? Pwede bang mag reklamo sa sss mismo? Anong mangyayari if hindi ko i-coconfirm. Kase base lng sa email ng accounting, hindi daw i-rerelease yung payment kung di daw ako mag confirm or approve. At ang hirap pa, damay yung second SN ko dahil dito.

We have compulsory onsite every 3 months and hindi ako pumapalya. Di ako nag rereklamo or nag rereason out kasi nga required naman yun sa kompanya. 

Di daw ako sumasali sa mga pa contest and if mag eat out daw with the team. 
-sa contest, ano naman sasal8han ko i.whole team i.rerepresent ko tapos di naman ako creative o talented - tapos na ako sa era na ipapahiya ko sarili ko hoooy - sa highschool lang yuun😭😭😭

Sa eat naman - sumasama naman ako if after work eh, pero hindi yung mga planned ones na ginagawa nila sa weekends. I want to rest naman.

Context:

Nilagay ko sa ref yong isa sa mga chocolates na regalo saken ng jowa ko nung Valentine’s Day.
9PM-6AM ang shift ko. Bago pumasok sa prod, nilagay ko muna yong chocolate sa ref sa pantry.
Pag break ko ng 11:30PM, nung kukunin ko na yong chocolate, napansin kong bukas na. Gulat talaga ang ferson, taz nung kinuha ko na, dun ko nalaman na wala na yong laman.

It’s not the first time na mawalan ako ng chocolate sa ref, ang nakakagalit lang na part is yong audacity nung kumuha na ‘yong laman lang talaga ang kinuha nya at iniwan pa yong box doon. Nangiinsulto ba sya at pinapamukha nya sa may-ari nung kinuha nya na “oh ayan box lang sayo”. Nakakahighblood.

Nagrequest ako for a CCTV pull-up kasi that same week nawalan din ng baon yong ka-team ko. In my thoughts, hindi  yon titigil hanggat hindi nahuhuli. Ngayon pagkain, bukas ano na naman nanakawin nya?

After 2 days, which is today, lumabas na yong result.

Nahuli na yong culprit. Finally.

Babae, nakita sa CCTV na siningit nya pala yong pagkain sa damit at ipinasok sa prod. Nireview ang CCTV sa prod at nakitang pinamigay pa nya yong chocolate sa mga ka team nya.

The audacity ni ate girl talaga.

During the CCTV review, HR and security was there, ang hatol kay girl is termination and ang reason is “theft”. +EDIT: Pero hindi pa po terminated si girl, bale “termination” po ang parusa nya.

I am kind of underpaid dito sa current work, and when asked during the phone call interview sa hr about sa current pay ko medyo nagpanic ako and ang sinabi kong basic pay amount ko is +10k from my current basic pay.

Ano po kaya pwedeng mangyari if ever mahire man ako, or kung sakali  what are the chances that mapapansin nila?

Thank you. I learned my lesson po not to lie na next time.

PS:

I actually have allowances na natatanggap ko din monthly na di nagrereflect sa payslip, so if ever na tatanungin ako ulit kung bakit iba, I'll say, I did not hear it clearly because during the initial interview we are having signal problems din.",28,65,0.9,True,Discussions 💭,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/1axumz2/lied_about_my_current_salary_in_a_job_interview/,2024-02-23 15:24:29,1axumz2
403,Can I resign immediately?,"This may be somewhat ironic, kasi as an HR alam ko na kailangan ung 30 days na rendering. Pero here are my several thoughts kung OKAY LANG BA NA MAG IMMEDIATE RESIGN NA AKO. 

1. I work in the HR dept. I was diagnosed with Major Depressive and of course most of my days is down talaga yung mood ko. As in. ganon. And namisinterpret ako ng mga co workers ko as offended or serious daw ganon, pero tbh, naka autopilot ako. There are times na feeling ko na lang is pinanonood ko sarili ko na magtrabaho. 
2. Yung private na usapan namin between me and my immediate supervisor, akala ko sa aming dalawa lang, hindi pala, nakakarating din pala sa iba naming ka-dept. considering na medyo private yung usapan namin. So and ending, namisinterpret na naman ako ng iba naming colleague. Naooffend daw ako sa mga jokes nila, which in my case, hindi ako naooffend, but there are some jokes na belong ung I.T namin na sobrang bastos at manyak talaga nung dating. Dun ako naiinis, kasi hindi appropriate setup para mangbastos ung office. Puro misinterpret, pero di naman nila ako kinakausap kung ano ba talaga yung problema. 
3. so nalaman ko from a friend na pinag-usapan pala nila ako during lunch time. Ang sabi, nagdadabog daw ako kasi yung pagstamp ko raw and ung pagbukas ko ng printer. Sabi ng isa naming colleague, nagsorry daw siya pero di ko raw pinansin (pinansin ko nman siya sabi ko ok lang yun), tapos sabi nung isang hr officer na hirap daw silang intindihin ako, tas ako na raw may problema. nagtatanong ako na bakit hindi na lang ako yung kinausap nila, instead na gawin nila akong pulutan during lunch. So nakarating sa akin yng news, yung hr officer na nagsabi na nahihirapan daw akong intindihin, sinabihan niya yung friend ko na ""I'm disappointed in you, sinabi mo sa kanya yung mga pinag-usapan natin."" Diba dapat sa sarili nila madisappoint sila? kasi mga supervisor sila pero ganon sila mag act sa subordinates nila? 
4. deliberate na nila akong iniignore, inunfriend na ako ng mga workmates namin, and hindi daw nila alam kung paano ako pakikisamahan. kinausap ko yung immediate supervisor ko regarding this, sinabi niya nga na ang draining ko raw sa work kasi ang moody ko raw and hindi raw nila alam pano daw ako pakikisamahan. Mood disorder yung diagnosis sakin, ang hiningi ko lang naman is konting emapthy and compassion. Mga Psych grad pa naman sila and yung immediate sup ko may RPm license. 
5. akala ko tapos na, kasi nag usap na kami nung immediate sup ko. sabi ko, saming dalwa na lang ung napag-usapan, tapos napagkwentuhan na naman nila nung isang HR Officer, tas ito na yung time na inunfrien ako ng most ng coworkers ko. 
6. Ayoko na pumasok considering na hostile na yung environment at expected ko na magiging hostile pa ito lalo na kapag bumalik ako after ng Sick leave ng isang linggo. Gusto ko na umalis. Hindi na kaya ng mental health ko to the point na nag increase yung dosage ng gamot ko becauase of the workplace stress.

Pwede kaya ako mg immediate resign?",1,8,0.67,True,Advice Needed 🤔,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/1axw0k5/can_i_resign_immediately/,2024-02-23 16:58:56,1axw0k5
404,Stand Up for Our Unsung Heroes: Support Better Salary and Benefits for Non-Uniformed PNP Staff,"Non-uniformed personnel of the Philippine National Police (PNP) play a crucial role in maintaining law and order, often working under hazardous conditions similar to their uniformed counterparts. Despite this, they do not receive comparable compensation or benefits. These dedicated individuals are exposed to danger during their duty in police stations and work under exigent circumstances, yet their remuneration does not reflect these risks. It is essential that we address this disparity to ensure fairness and encourage commitment among these vital workers.

&#x200B;

According to data from the PNP itself, there are thousands of non-uniformed personnel serving across the country. Their roles range from administrative tasks to technical support - all integral parts of our policing system. Yet, they face significant financial challenges due to inadequate salary packages.

&#x200B;

We call upon the government and relevant authorities to review and enhance the salary structure, allowances, and benefits for non-uniformed personnel within PNP. This will not only provide them with fair compensation but also boost morale among these hardworking individuals who contribute significantly towards public safety.

&#x200B;

Join us in urging for a change that recognizes their service appropriately by signing this petition today.

408,Construction,"Tang*na!

So I work in construction industry and there makikilala mo lahat ng ugali ng tao. From a drunk Project-in-Charge, well at least maasahan pa naman but ineffective leader of the pack. A safety officer who sees himself highly na akala mo kung sinong gago na ayaw maunder ko kahit ako yung engineer sa site. Lastly, kapwa engineer ko na walang kakwenta kwenta, nagawa lang kung magpapasipsip sa boss(yup that's what my instinct says).

So first off, PIC ko, my time na 3 pa kaming field engineer, inom lang sila ng inom ako yung naiiwan parati sa site na 50+ hectares. Nagopen up ako sa kanya that time na, ""Sir, nakaktamad na mga kasamahan ko"" sabihin pa naman sakin ""That way, tinuturoan lang kita kung pano maghandle ng subordinate mo, eh ako nga ganto, yung SO natiyagaan ko ng ilang taon"" ***not exact words pero ganyan point*** Maybe mali ko din kase Im very vocal na makahawak ng sariling project something like that but no nakakapot*ngina lang talaga. Eh yun na nga pinakisamahan ko na yung isa, dadagdagan pa. As of now, he's drinking alcohol na naman. HAHA

Secondly, Safety Officer. Very vocal na magnanakaw. At pot*ngina pakita lang sa umaga tapos na araw. Gusto mo pa kahit sunday na di napasok nakatime-in ka. 

Lastly, kapwa Field Engineer ko, yun nga sees himself so above others, also wala talagang kapaki pakialam sa mundo but seems like siya yung good shot kay boss. Maybe my fault kase simpleng reporting hindi ko mabigay. Eto pa, lasinggero din, kainoman niya actually ngayon yung PIC namin, for sure di na naman makakapasok ng umaga like everyday na siyang ganyan. What offends me the most dito sa kupal na to. Eh ako yung nagpapakahirap, nagpapakabilad sa site eh siya pa yung naka-OT na kahit di na nga nakapasok ng 5 oras sa umaga. HAHAHA

409,Tolerating bad employees ,"I like my job, I really do. I have been doing this for over 10 years now. Something happened just recently that shocked me. One of the leaders (let’s call the person leader Pei) was having an affair with one of the bosses (Let’s call that person boss Pa). Leader Pei is not the most loved person the company and many employees hate that person because of her attitude but she delivers. I can’t just say it’s all 100% professional nor ethical. Boss Pa was one of the most looked up bosses that we have in the company. Imagine the shock we have when we knew they were having an affair. After all of that has been exposed, Boss Pa decided to leave but the  Leader Pei stayed. Our Big Boss knows about the unethical works but what we don’t understand is how he shut everyone down and let Leader Pei without consequences. I feel that having leaders and bosses like that is against my values so it was not an easy decision to make that I had to leave. I can’t imagine having bosses who are not honest. How would I trust them? So I left. It felt like a bad breakup leaving like that and I cried for days. Now i just knew that leader pei was promoted? I don’t understand why we need to not just tolerate bad employees but also reward them. I don’t understand why they say a bad reputation ok because result matters more. I know I should just move on from this but I can’t help but wonder is the juice really worth the squeeze.",0,0,0.33,True,Rant 😡,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/1ay1zuk/tolerating_bad_employees/,2024-02-23 22:38:08,1ay1zuk
410,Feeling Company Successor,"So I work sa isang Substation as a ROW (Right of way) worker and our task is to communicate and negotiate sa mga land owners na dadaanan ng line ng mga towers ng kuryente. Yung sahod desente naman kaya bumuhay naman kaya talagang naenganyo ako pumasok sa company yun ngalang naassign ako da ibang substation na kabilang probinsya which is isang bus pa galing saamin di tulad kung saan ako nag apply na isang jeep lang nandun agad ako. Sakin goods naman yon dahil ayos nga yung sahod na ibibigay malaki laki kumpara sa iba kaya nag go ako kahit medyo malayo nag grab ako ng opportunity. Newly graduate pala kami halos na nag apply at sa awa ng Diyos naka pasok sa company do yun nanga bali kontrata kasi dito sa ROW department at second batch napala kami dito mga kasama ko nag apply kaya talagang back to zero kami at need pagaralan yung trabaho which is normal naman, wala naman siguro baguhan sa trabaho na super galing na agad diba? Naintindihan naman yon ng mga seniors namin at nag pursigi kami na matutunan yung trabaho ayos naman samahan sa work namin may mga panahon na wala ginagawa may mga panahon na sobrang busy typical na working environment ba. Hanggang nag start nakaming mag field which means na pupunta kami sa mga land owners na kakausapin at inenegotiate namin dito na nagstart yung tunay na trabaho. Eto pinaka mahirap sa trabaho pero enjoy naman yun ngalang yung field namen e halos 3- 4 hours dipende sa traffic bago ka makadating from the substation papunta palang yon. Tas pabalik ganun din katawag which means sa travel time palang kakain na ng oras, eto nanga unang field namen call time e 4am sobrang aga halos wala pangang masasakyan non pahirapan e galing pako probinsya almost 1 hour byahe 3am palang otw nako tapos before 4 am andun naako and waiting for our seniors and co workers bali company car sasakyan namin papunta sa mga land owners at nakarating kami dun ng halos mag 8-9am na dipa nakapg almusal dahil sobrang aga pa nang gising di naman ako nag aalmusan ng alas 3 ng umaga, so yun nanga pagdating namin don almusal muna which is own expense ahh yakr note ,at after kumain palang magstart ang trabaho which is pagpunta sa landowners and to negotiate 
. Tinuruan kame pano tamang procedures at natutu naman kami onti onti hangga magamay nanamin pano yung patakaran sa trabaho, lunch kami ulit nagastos kami din gumagastos da pagkain ng driver namin hati hati kami kasi medyo mababa sahod ng driver yun ata yung tradisyon niladon saakin goods man mag ambag dahil laking tulong din ng driver namin after ng lunch work ulit hangga natapos na yung work halos mag alas 5 na at nasa land owner pa kami non bali makabalik kami sa substation halos 8-9pm ng gabi at uuwi pako samin kaya minsan late na ako makauwi. Patuloy yung sa tuwing nag fiefield kami minsan maaga umuwi pero madalas late na uuwi .kung minsan naman friday to sunday yung field namin at pinapahotel kami don company pay naman yung accommodation yung umagahan libre na sa hotel minsan pero pag need magbyahe kahit nasa hotel na kami near sa mga land owner super aga alis na agad kahit dipa start ng working hours.

Ayos lang naman mag work ng overtime e yung pangit ngalang di nababayaran yung overtime namin bali kahit gaano pa kaaga meeting time namin at gaano man katagal bago matapos ang work di yun counted sa binabayad samin. Example 4am meeting time tas makadating kami ng substation ng 8pm which is 15 hours excluded yun 12-1 na lunch break hindi bayad yon. Tapos sariling gastos pa sa pagkain and pangit kasi don e may per dime na pinapasa para sa food expense pero di pinipirmahan ng teamleader namin yon kahit yung overtime dapat na maybayad din ayaw niya asikasuhin , at ang reason nya ayaw nya mamoblema sa company . Nabalitaan ko kasi sa ibang ROW department sa substation bayad lahat yan OT & per dime bukod tangi lang yung samin dahil for promotion pala tong si TL , gusto koman mag voice out halos takot kami dahil unang trabaho namin to after graduation tapos nasanay na yung mga tao na ganon patakaran karhit Agrabyado na.

420,DO NOT JOIN THIS COMPANY! ,"🚩 OpsWerks 🚩
I dont know where to start, but this company is literally a BIG RED FLAG. I’ve been with them for the past couple of years and thankful that I have exited this NIGHTMARE. The company values is truly amazing especially when you a get a chance to talk with the CEO, he really values the company’s mission and vision. However, the leaders do not really practice what they preach, while the BLINDED CEO did not know, FAVORITISM plays an incredible part for you to be in a good zone and be promoted, you need to make “sipsip” and be a “yes sir/mam” person just to fit the organization and be in the “SAFE” position. Psychological safety is not real here, I was going thru some personal matters that slightly affects my work and still remain composed throughout, it just affect my work a bit. I was able to share this with the assigned PBP and trusted her that this would remain confidential, However I felt betrayed by her when I learned she shared it with my lead and with the PCT Head. From then on, NEVER NA AKO nagshare ng personal struggles ko especially to that PBP with PABEBE VOICE who is obviously a 2 faced monster! KARMA hits different now and digital, hope it hits HARD! The PCT team implements and revised WHENEVER NEEDED, WEEKLY, DAILY, MONTHLY, YEARLY, NAME IT and they got it, renewal and revision of the policies. What company revisits their company policy on this frequency? Or you are just favoring the FAVORITES for them not to leave the company? The leaders are prevented to undergo EXTERNAL EFFECTIVE TRAINING, for them to have a better leadership program yet the management insisted to create an in-house program for the “home grown” leads when in fact they don’t even know how to properly lead a member. Even INCOMPETENT people are being promoted by the management. The company is being run ONLY by the VP and no other else, if you are not her type, you will be the “FAVORITE”, if this will continue.. you will be demotivated and will be left out like you are no longer a part of the organization even within your team, and you know what will happen NEXT. Either submit your resignation or be.. yes, TERMINATED. Dito ka lang makakaexperience na yung team mate mo biglang nowhere to be found na.. malalaman mo nalang terminated na! Buti nga dun sa isang kiss ass na TL na balitaan ko ay wala na din ngayon. The tools and training platforms are used only internally to its client and the work shift schedule is really drowning, imagine juggling (morning, mid and night) EVERY MONTH! Work from home set up is only for the favorite ones, WHERE is the FAIRNESS and EQUALITY? And they are really ALLERGIC in WFH set up as they tend to promote “building a healthy community”, or just LACK OF TRUST to the members because you are just afraid that people will only do the things you are already doing! In short, TAKOT SA SARILING MULTO. Come on! You are an IT company yet, the option to work from home is NOT an option. GROW UP NARCISSIST AND SELF CENTERED VP, THE WORLD IS NOT REVOLVING AROUND YOU! The company is NOT renowned in the Philippines and yet you are ACTING LIKE you are the go to and #1 IT company. There are many COMPETENT member that already left the company. The TOs are the VPs puppet, imagine one team with high attrition, its not the TOs fault? I mean, whose fault it is? The member? Since there’s already a BLIND ITEM raised in a different post, MAGLANTAD na kayo magJOWANG LEADERS! Lahat na lang pabor sa JOWA mo kahit sya na yung problema.

434,"It's not teaching, it's the system and the unreasonable workload: my partner ""quits"" teaching","((ang bigat ng dibdib ko while typing this))

Dati pa lang nababanggit na nya saken na ayaw nya tumanda na teacher. Well, masaya sya sa pagtuturo. Nakikinig ako palagi sa mga kwento nya sa naging atae nya habang nagdidinner kami. Gusto nya na nagdedesign ng slides and nagdedecorate. Kaso, na-reach na ata ang threshold nya. 

This month, observe ko yung pagod nya. Nagsabay-sabay ang school activities. Tapos expected pa sa kanila na tapos lahat ng checkables and grades the week after the school event na teachers din ang nag-organize (btw my partner works in a privage schooll). Sa kanilang mga teacher, isa sya sa binigyan ng maraming subject preps this sem. On top of it, may advisory pa sya and pinaghahandle ng event. Ako yung nahihirapan para sa kanya at sa sitwasyon nya. Pagkarating sa bahay, baba lang nh bag tapos scroll sa phone - ito na lang pahinga nya. Pagkakain ng dinner, work na naman. 

Tanda ko sunday non, pumasok sya ng room ko umiiyak. Pagod na pagod na daw sya. Gusto lang naman nya na makapahinga bg weekends and magawa gusto nya kaso need pa din magtrabaho. Ramdam ko yung bigat sa balikat nya at sa bawat hakbang nya, as someone na umalis din sa teaching. Kanina nagsabi na sya, gusto na nya magquit. This time, feeling ko heto na yun. 

Sinamahan ko sya hanggang sa makatulog sya. Sinusuntok nya kasi yung pader kaya alisto ako. Pero sa totoo lang, mas mabigat yung pakiramdam ko. Pressured din siguro sya kasi nanghihingi sa kanya immediate family members nya. And yes ang hirap ng buhay.

Enough with ""manage mo lang mga tasks mo"" advices because you're taking souls from people!! May hinanakit ako sa mga school adminis na hindi iniisip ang kalagayan ng mga teachers nila (i'm not talking about wellness seminars). Wag nyong samantalahin yung passion sa pagtuturo ng mga tao kasi kahit pagod sila physically, mentally, and emotionally sa unreasonable workload na ibinibigay nyo, they still try their best to show up... for the kids. Pero maawa naman kayo. Iayon ang pasahod sa workload tang*** 

Di ko alam kung papasok sya bukas. Di ko alam kung anong balak nya. Sabi ko na lang thru chat na kung anong maging decision nya, nandito lang ako. 

Sorry ang bigat bigat ng dibdib ko hindi ko alam kung anong dapat kong gawin o maramdaman. Hindi din ako makapagtrabaho nang maayos. Gusto ko din umiyak. Normal ba to? Huhu

435,Paternal Leave exploiters,"There's a certain company wherein they exploit Paternity Leave to be converted as cash. This was just a shared story.

My colleague sent a letter to HR that wished to apply for Paternity Leave on January 9 of this year. It was allegedly denied because it has to ""reach approval"" of a certain supervisor.

He complied with their ""verbal instruction"". He resubmitted them application for Paternity Leave with seven (7) working days from February 8, submitted on January 18. Approved! However, they are trying to bait them to convert the Paternity Leave to cash — in which he declined.

Come February 11. The GM asked him to report to office FOR NO APPARENT REASON (just come report to the office). On the afternoon, he was summoned to the office to tell him personally (without any written response to the request) that the Company wanted a counter-proposal to the request and make the Paternity Leave to be spent on an intermittent manner (Every Mondays and Fridays). At the same time, they are insisting to convert the PL to cash. He then again declined.

Then recently, he suddenly received a phone call yesterday to proceed to the client's office with a meeting at 12. He informed HR that he appealed to move the PL from this date to that date (offset) because of an emergency meeting.

=====

These are the questions:

1. Is the move to appeal the Paternity Leave to be moved a different date ""legal and proper"" because the company suddenly asked him to report same day for a certain meeting?

2. Can this verbal proposal of converting Paternity Leave be reported to DOLE for alleged malpractice and violating IRR of RA 8187?

3. Would it be illegal if they declined the offset leave appeal in connection with the PL and the Company rather file the said day as OT?

4. If any hour within the day allotted for PL has been used due to a certain work, is the employee eligible to offset the PL day leave within the working day?

5. The Company is not allowed to forfeit the PL because of an emergency meeting with a certain client. Is this correct?

I got this message which directed me to a bitly link (link shorterner siya). Upon checking the link sa Bitly Link Checker, I discovered na it leads to a .RAR file download. This is a compressed file that may contain a lot of things including VIRUSES.

If legit talaga yung job opportunity, you can ask them to send you the job description via email in TEXT format. Basta ALWAYS CHECK LINKS before clicking them, lalo na if sasabihin na application form siya.

456,My boss wants me to work on my day off.,"Nasstress ako sa boss ko. I get it that we need to send email for our leave requests and I understand that it is subject for approval. We render OTs on weekdays and RDOTs on weekends (yung weekdays namin umaabot ng 8-10hrs yung nirerender namin plus another 8hrs RDOT) With that, parang covered na namin yung 7days and more pa a week na rendering ng work because of OTs. Now, nalaman ko na may update na pati pala yung pag ayaw mo or di ka pwede magrender ng RDOT ay need i-email and subject din pala for approval. Meron akong gagawin sana this weekend and hindi ko sya naisend kaagad sa email. Chinat ko kaagad yung boss ko na if need pa ba magsend ng email pra ipaalam na di ako mag rerender ng Rest Day OT. sabi nya oo and sige magsend daw ako ng email. So nag send ako ng email kasi nag usap na kami via chat bago ako mag email then nalaman ko na disapproved yung hindi ko pag render ng RDOT. I was actually mad kasi first of all, rest day ko iyon so bakit kailangan ko pa ipaalam na hindi mo papasukan and subject for approval sya? Now lang nagkaron ng changes ng ganito and madali naman akong kausap sa OTs. Pero nakakapag taka at nakakainis na need din palang iapprove kung ayaw mo mag RDOT. Kahit inis na inis ako, triny ko pakiusapan yung boss ko via chat and explained na mayroon talaga akong gagawin nyan na hindi ako makakapasok and I tried to compromise that I will render 2hr daily OTs for next week para makabawi. He again said sige and magreply ako sa naunang email. Again, I just read na ang nilagay nya naman sa email, approved yung hindi ko pag render ng RDOT BUT, I need to render 2hrs OT ON TOP OF THE MANDATORY WEEKDAY OTS. So kung may mandatory OT ng 1hr, I need to render 3hrs. if 2hrs, I need to do 4. Pagod na ako to be honest. Ayoko din mangupal kasi mas gusto ko yung maayos na usapan I am really trying to compromise sa mga mawawala ko pero feel ko na pinagiinitan ako ng boss ko and di ko alam kung bakit. Hindi rin naman sya nagsasabi sakin. Everytime may absences ako especially kapag sl, kahit 1 day lang, lagi akong may back up proof. Hindi rin naman ako pala absent pero eto lang naman yung hinihingi ko din na hindi pumasok ng weekend. Valid ba tong inis ko and pwede ba yun sa labor laws na hindi ka papayagan magtake ng scheduled rest day ang tao mo? or kahit yung extended OTs? Oo nga pala. Di pa ako makapag resign kasi naghahanap pa ako hahaha gusto ko lang din sana maglabas ng sama ng loob at the same time if mayroon kayong advice. Sana walang makakilala sa akin dito haha Thank you.

457,"Sad and disappointed at this ""redeployment"" when it's really a redundancy","Earlier today I just got news that we are getting laid off due to our company downsizing. Pero we won't get any severance pay for our involuntary separation from the company.   

Timeline:  5:13 AM nakatanggap ako ng meeting invite from our manager, stating na wag na kami mag join for the day's team meeting because the meeting that she sent was more important. 5:30AM-6:00AM ang schedule ng call. 6:30 another call was set in place for us to talk to HR.  

I didn't even process what was being said, all I could think was ""bakit sakin nangyayari to?""   The next words I hear once I entered the call was ""I know this news is sudden and we understand you, so if you have questions..."" my heart sank immediately to the bottom of my stomach. 

Last year may mga whispers na about a possible mass tanggalan of employees due to the business' declining need due to declining ramps din. But our EVP promised that no one would get removed from their jobs because of this new movement.   We asked and asked for time to process this information because we JUST essentially lost our livelihood, and asked if this **redeployment** had a severance package to which they said **NO** to. Walang magiging separation pay, HR and Recruitment would find new ""homes"" for us at the company, and effectively we are already rendering our final 30 days with the company. And if makahanap si HR and recruitment ng bagong work for us within the company we would need to undergo reassessments and re-certifications. 

All of us that were laid off has 2+years of tenure. We asked about the basis ng pagpili sa list ng mga ma\*reredeploy\* and apparently they didn't even look at our performance evaluations, the only thing that they looked at was a ""Last hired, First out"" basis (naging stock pa kami sa 711) 

I just celebrated my 2nd year work anniversary with this company and hindi ako ang last hire within the team. Even based on tenure, I was previously a part of another team before I pioneered this team that I'm with right now. And sobrang nakaka confuse lang on why they didn't even look at our performance when deciding on who would be severed from the company.  

I'm so disappointed on how they handled our case and how they chose the names off that list kasi we were all performing well, we were all doing our jobs, and now we have to deal with the fact that we just lost it.

458,Job hunting here in PH,"Im in confused or maybe in tricky situation doing job hunting here in ph.

For context:

My first job here is in ph as implementation officer. Implementing business function on the client side, doing technical demo or training. Tumagal ako dito sa company na to hanggan sa napromote ako in Supervisory position.

Then after 3 years I left the company kasi parang wala na movement to go up. Saka I want to learn and explore more in depth in IT kaya nagresign ako then got my 2nd job as System engineer doing texc support, QA’s and back end support kasi maliit lang yun it group. So this job is good for learning a lot of new things in IT. Nasa track na ako in IT career king hindi lang nakakuha ng wife ko ng job sa U.S. as faculty.

At that time since, hindi naman ganun kalakihan ang sahod at may 4 na anak, nagdecide kami na igrab yun opportunity dun sa U.S. and with that reason, I resign to my work and decide to follow/support my wife. I moved to US and my kids as well to live in US. Got the job there but not in IT position. At that time, hirap makapasok as IT officer since hinahanap nila is yun may green card na. Pinanghahawakan ko lang is work permit but my visa is sponsorship visa lang. i got work there in Manufacturing industry. So i started as production associate and napromote din as Quality assurance officer. My job there is to do electrical/physical inspections of electrical switchboard. Yun mga malalaking electrical cabinet na to control electrical supply within the building. More on electrical engineering functions kumbaga ang ginagawa ko since im reading electrical designs, sde and other documents. Mapropromote na sana ako as Engineering Auditor kung di lang talaga maeexpired yun working visa ko.

Now come after my 5 years sa US at need na namin bumalik ph (span ng sponsoship visa) . We tried all avenues to stay indefinitely sa US pero wala talaga and decide na lang na umuwi na lang para walang bad record sa US kung may pagkakataon na makabalik. Nakabalik ako last year and decide na magpahinga muna since moving my family from US back here in PH is really stressful at may konti naman kami naipon para makapagrelaxs kahit konti.

So now naghahanap ako, mga inaapplyan ko is more on IT uli since yun naman background ko before ako umalis sa ph. At wala rin naman manufacturing company doing electrical panels/cabinet para suited dun sa last job ko pero im trying also applying in manufacturing company as production engineering or as test engineer thinking na in line naman kahit papaano to sa last job ko. Im applying, test engineers, production engineer, it support/system engineering ,service engineer or even QA. Mostly yun inaaplyan ko is mga level 1 or level 2 position basta may 20k na monthly lang pede na sa akin. Hindi naman ako nag aapply as Supervisor lalo na sa IT since yun experience ko is mababaw palang in IT.

With all those application na submit ko at interviews na napupuntahan ko, lagi ako nadedeny due to this reasons;

1. Yun inaaplyan ko is level 1 or level 2 lang pero yun resume ko is pang supervisor na raw. Overqualified daw kasi naging supervisor na ako though almost 10 years na nun naging Supervisor ako.
2. Applying level 1/2 jobs pero 36 na ako so seems na matanda na raw ako for that position.
3. Nakakaala daw sa kanila yun pag iba ko ng indust

Nag apply na rin ako as service engineer kaso wala rin ako experience dun sa product nila. Im applying for these position thinking na pede ko naman matutunan mga yan dahil may background naman ako as IT tech and support pero negative. Sometimes may feeling ako na intmidated din yun nag iinterview dahil sa experience na nasa resume.

Alam ko naman mejo weak ang resume ko since from IT naging manufacturing industry ako nun nasa US. So hindi ganun kasolid ang IT experience ko.

May masusuggest po ba kayo para magkajob na rin. Hindi naman ako nag aasam ng mataas na position o sahod. Kahit 23k to 25k lang na sahod pede na aa akin.",1,1,1.0,True,Advice Needed 🤔,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/1b23ctk/job_hunting_here_in_ph/,2024-02-28 18:58:12,1b23ctk

Ang kacheapan ng reliasourcing, hindi naman endorsement mangyayari, magaapply ka ulit sa client. Initial at final interview ulit. Kung ako dun sa mga naendorse wag na nila ituloy. Maghanap na sila ng bigger company. Don't be a bitch sa pipitsugin kumpanya. 🖕🖕🖕

Yung mga trip naman nila pag-stayin kahit may mga benta, imbes na JO na naging 1 month probitionary pa. Yung isang performer is expected to bring $25,000 as monthly revenue. 🫨🫨🫨🫨

👹👹 MIDLEADING 👹👹

Ewan ko ba nabola rin ko ng mga hayop. Yung production nila parang kuta ng pogo yung hitsura. Hindi maayos. Mema mema. When i asked about it sabi nila nakalaan daw yung pera ""pangmudmod"" sa mga performer.

Ipapakita during interview yung incentives ng mga performer. It will sound like na kaya kahit ng mga newbie na kumita ng 5 to 6 digits as incentives on top ng monthly salary mo. To good to be true talaga kaso nakakasilaw eh. Edi tuloy ako. 

Pagstart mo ng training, deputa. Pang-intern lang yung sahod mo for 1 week. Mababa pa nga eh. 59% ng regular daily rate ang pasahod. Minus the promised allowance.  PERO NAKAKADECEIVE talaga yung 🌟🌟 with unlimite commision🌟🌟 and PHP100,000 as incentives kaya nagtuloy lang kami. 

Pagdating namin sa production, ang konti ng tao. At mukhang come and go lang sila. Yung pinagmamalaki nilang comission are being distributed only to the elite fews. Tapos yung mga tenured na yun nagpakasasa na sa pambubudol.

Narealize ko...  Hindi attainable sa newbie yung 100k pangbudol lang nila. Sa mga newbie need mong makabenta ng $15,000 in a month with other metrics para makakuha ng $200. 

May benta naman ako bago ako mag-awol kaso di kaya ng konsenya ko magstay sa kumpanyang borderline scammer. Customers were ugly crying just to get refunded. 

📩📩📩 BOTTOMLINE/CONCLUSION

❌Budol ang Reliasourcing. Cheap ng training at hindi stable ang employment. 

✅ Apply ka na lang sa company na may JO day 1 pa lang ng training. Or may JO na bago ka pa start. JO is a good assurance na ike-keep ng company ang sinabi nila during the application process. 

❌ Wag papasilaw sa bait nilang kesyong pagkataas taas na  incentive ni ganito or ganyan. Nakakapagtaka naman yung mataas yung incentive pero walang allowance? 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️

✅ Apply ka na lang sa mg jobs na may 30k and up. Wala pang pressure sa revenue at walang kargo de konsensya na nambudol ka ng small business owners.

The opening was related to marketing. Had an initial interview with them last January, it started ok, pero grabe sobrang rude nung nag initial interview sakin. Parang walang sinusunod na format para alamin kung ano yung qualificaitons ng candidate, lahat ng follow up questions sobrang rude, napaka unecessary nung mga follow up questions, and his overall demeanor in interviewing me was demeaning. Nakakapang insulto at overall na pakikipag usap sa'kin was commanding-- beh, di kita boss hr ka lang.

Soon after I was scheduled for another round of interview, now with the HR manager. Bungad banaman sakin nung assistant ""Hoy, paalala ko sa'yo may interview ka ngayon ha."" 

Nag taka ako syempre kung sino yun, di muna ako  nag salita, naramdaman ata na di ko siya nakilala sa boses niya, saka siya nagpakilala

""This is \*rt from C0nc3pt!on M!D3@ !nC, pasok ka nalang dun sa interview link""

His reception was bad, pero his tone all throughout the interview reeked of arrogance, literally.

474,Pwede ba akong magreklamo sa DOLE if...,"Context:

I work in customer service. Ang trabaho lang namin ay tumanggap ng complaints, i-record ang complaints sa system namin, at i-forward sa technical crew para mapuntahan yung complaint. 24/7 yung station namin. 12-hour shifts, every other day ang pasok. Mag isa lang ang duty every day. 4 people lang kaming nagpapalitan. So kapag may magli-leave, magkasakit or whatnot, may isa samin na kukuha nung shift. Nangyayari, minsan, 24 hours straight ang duty. Kung hindi man, 3 days straight na 12 hours.

Ang instruction samin, bawal umuwi hangga't walang kapalit. Kung uuwi, memo.

Napaka-unfair lang para sakin kasi, ako na yung pumasok at nagreport sa duty, tapos kapag bigla akong hindi papasukan ng kapalit ko na minsan e naglalakwatsa lang naman, ako pa yung magkaka-memo kapag umuwi ako, hindi magkakamemo yung umabsent. Madalas na mangyari na may lakad akong napeperwisyo dahil hindi pumasok ang kapalitan. Napupuno na ako kaya minsan naiisip ko na lang na umuwi kahit walang kapalit.

Sa pagkakaalam ko, hindi maaaring pilitin ng employer ang employee na mag overtime, may ilang conditions lang kung saan pwede. [As it says here.](https://www.philstar.com/pang-masa/punto-mo/2021/10/28/2137227/maari-bang-pilitin-ang-mga-empleyado-na-mag-overtime)

297,Is this considered power tripping?,"Gf is a nurse and works for a hospital as an ER staff. On the 3rd week of March, we will be travelling for a family event. She filed a VL for 7 days and it was filed the last week of Feb. The VL was approved by her supervisor (Head nurse) however this was rejected by someone higher from their department. (We'll call this person -- Person A)

The head nurse told my gf that her request was rejected. ^((1)) She says Person A said that they can't file a leave after the day of their day offs AND ^((2)) that she (my gf) has been given a chance since she used a LOA last year. ^((3))  Lastly, the head nurse told my gf that Person A said that it's either ""Resign or (Hospital name)"". Implying that they either have to work or resign.

^((1)) This doesn't make any sense especially in the past, my gf and her coworkers would take a VL after their day off. (Day off, day off, **VL**)

^((2)) Now, my gf had to use a LOA last year for almost a month to focus for her NCLEX exam. This was approved by everyone required to approve the LOA **including** Person A. After the LOA my gf went back working and she doesn't even have poor attendance at all and been working diligently. Sometimes pulling off a lot of OTs to help out after her shift.

This Person A just implied that employees from their department aren't allowed to take a vacation / trip with their family for a week then? It's either resign to enjoy your vacation (which you are entitled to) or work under a toxic management?

Points:

* VL request was filed 2 weeks earlier
* VL was approved by the Head Nurse who is in charge of making the schedule. (meaning the vacation leave was already considered and applied when their schedule for March was created)
* Person A, who has a higher position rejected the VL even tho their schedule was already good and there are nurses to cover for my gf during her leaves

Questions:

1. Is it valid for Person A to bring up the LOA when he himself was one of those who approved the LOA last year?
2. Is this considered power tripping?

I’ve been casually checking on job opportunities since the start of the year and came across an opening for a finance manager post. I answered all the online tests and I passed the final interview. (Yes, with the CFO). Got the congratulatory email from the HR and they also said that before they proceed, they need to do “salary analysis” since the post is under “executive payroll” and sent me a form requiring me to put into detail my current compensation and benefits. Like all, everything. Not just the amounts, they’re asking for the timing of bonuses, the % of merit increases, other allowances, type of car, engine placement (hahaha jusko), max benefit limit of your health card, health card premium, etc. Basically red flags all over. I declined to provide the info requested. Aside from it being confidential, I think I’d be on the losing end if they got all those information without even a job offer from them. I politely told them that if they would extend an offer, they can provide the standard package for the role and we can negotiate from there. I was willing to show my payslips once a job offer has been extended. HR said they understood but still asked for my asking salary range (which I gave every interview). I gave them an annual amount which was only a 20% increase from my current. After that, they told me they wouldn’t push through with my application because “there were certain steps in the application process that were left unaccomplished, which led to our decision.”

312,Is my issue DOLE-able?,"Greetings all!

I was a healthcare worker in a government hospital for a year. I submitted my resignation letter last year and the HR personnel gave me a date that I should put as my resignation's effectivity date which I followed. 

I unfortunately was not able to render service since I was having mental health issues and at the same time was preparing shits as I am about to migrate out of the country, hence the resignation. 

I was always reaching out to HR and going there personally to ask for the things that I need to do to get my clearance and possibly backpay. The HR  personnel then told me to not expect any backpay and I might be the one who's indebted to them since they'll be deducting my absences from my backpay since I have don't have any leaves left. 

I was confused since I thought that our policy was no work, no pay. So I at least should be paid for the days I came in for that month. She gave me the clearance form which has the list of departments I needed signatures from and I did it the same day it was given to me. Yet when it came to the HR head, she told me to leave the papers with her since the HR head was on leave. 

Days, weeks have passed and my departure date was getting near and still, my papers haven't been signed. I started feeling that it may be intentional since I feel like I did my part on asking what are the things I need to do or sign before I go and she kept on insisting that I should just have an ""S.P.A"" to finish things for me, which I found odd since I can do it while I am still here. 

But whenever I ask for an update, it's either she's on leave or the HR head is on leave. Mind you, this issue has been going on from Sept (the effectivity date of my resignation) and it's March now. 

I have a work friend who's consistently asking for updates on my behalf and today, I was shocked by something. HR called her to get my documents, which was my clearance form, and have it signed by the departments that haven't yet. THE CLEARANCE FORM I LEFT TO THAT PERSONNEL WAS JUST AS IT WAS BEFORE I LEFT THE COUNTRY. Meaning, nothing has been done since I left the papers with her. I find it absolutely ridiculous.

I just wanted to get everything over with as I know that I won't get any of my benefits if I am not cleared. Is it really like this working for the government? Does it really take this much time? Is it legal to deduct my absences from my last pay? And should I take my case to DOLE?

So ayun nga po, graduate po ako ng IT and gusto ko sana maging QA Analysts though wala pa kong experience, but someone advised me okay lang yun kasi may training naman daw for junior. So one of the reasons nagresign me galing ako sa bpo as helpdesk/it helpdesk kasi medyo related sya sa IT due nagtrou2ble shoot kami and meron din kaming mga tech. Sorry medyo magulo ako magsummarize but hopefully makuha nyo padin.

So almost 11 months din naman ako nagwork dun and one of the reasons nagresign me kasi gusto ko magQA, and gusto ko magamit yung inaral ko, and hindi po me magaling magprogramming kaya kahit QA Analyst na lang talaga. Kaso medyo nakakasad lang kasi ang hirap maghanap ng job, yung feeling na kahit may nakalagay na no experience needed wala padin ang weird lang minsan nakakasad and ayoko naman din masayang yung inaral ko and gusto ko talaga sya mapush.

318,Refusal to release COE due to pending clearance,"Title says it all, but I'll give you guys more context.

I resigned from my previous job last year and I still have a pending clearance with them. Okay lang naman kasi may agreement na kami ng mga boss and managers re the issue.

Now, I found a new job and one of their pre-employment requirements is a certificate of employment (COE) from the last company. 

So, nag-request ako ng COE to my ex-employer's HR and they said na hindi nila ako bibigyan ng COE until hindi ko pa nase-settle yung pending clearance ko. 

Is the HR really allowed to refuse my COE request even though it is my right to ask for it, as a former employee, for whatever purposes I may use it for? Even DOLE's released a memo that an ex-employee may request for a COE and the company should give it to me within three working days upon request.

I already Googled this inquiry and I got mixed answers, pero so far most of the answers I'm seeing are favorable to my side. 

I just need to be enlightened on this matter. Thank you! :)",1,8,0.6,True,Advice Needed 🤔,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/1b7p783/refusal_to_release_coe_due_to_pending_clearance/,2024-03-06 11:14:56,1b7p783

325,The 13th month pay….,"Hello, bago lang ako sa reddit but, share ko lang experience ko ngayon sa company na pinapasukan ko. 

Nag simula kasi ito nung umuwi ako galing sa project namin which is nasa  Misamis Occidental, December 19 yun (pero ang usapan namin mga December 18 sana kasi mag prepare kami ng asawa ko sa wedding namin sa December 23) pero ayun nga pinapasok pa kami nun, kasi kinabukasan nun hanggang January 2 di ako papasok nun, pero alam naman nila kasi nga kasal and honeymoon, then fast forward, tapos na ang new year so pasukan na, nag report ako nung January 4 na, nagpaalam ako na di ako nung January 3 na di ako makakapasok kasi medyo nahirapan kami ni misis na makapag book ng bus sa Baguio. So ayun nga dumating na ako sa office then tinanong ko kung pwede ko na makuha yung 13th month ko, ang sabi ng asawa ng boss ko (yung asawa kasi ang finance manager nila) nasa boss ko daw yung 13th month ko, nasa sasakyan niya daw, nasa Masbate ang boss ko and na confirm naman ito ng boss ko na nasa kanya nga yung pera, tinatawagan daw ako ni boss nung 22, kaso siyempre dahil nga gahol na kami at dami pa naming ginawa sa preparation namin sa kasal di ko na naasikaso na tawagan or masagot ang call ng boss ko (somehow may mali din ako sa part na ito) pinapakuha niya daw kasi yung 13th month ko sa office nun. So ako sinabi ko na busy kami nung time na yun, kaya sabi niya pagbalik niya daw ibibigay, kaso kinabukasan nun flight namin bound to Mindanao project namin, so di ko na nakuha yung 13th month ko. So andito ako sa Mindanao panay follow up sa pera ko, kaso andami na nilang excuse na binigay, kesyo nagastos na daw ni boss yung pera, ibibigay daw pag nakasingil sa isang project, ibibigay daw pagpunta dito at ngayun pag uwi ko daw this March ibibigay sa akin. Nakaka frustrate pero kahit anong follow up ko ganyan lagi ang rason nila, pinagpapasahan ako ng boss ko at asawa niya. Anyways hope maibigay na nila pag uwi ko kasi pag hindi pa din, ireklamo ko na sila sa DOLE, at resign na din. Maganda ang salary pero walang benefits (sss,phic at hdmf) wala din ako pinirmahan na contract kaya not sure kung pakinggan din ako ng DOLE. Anyways salamat sa oras sa pagbabasa ng kwento ko. Update ko kayo pag uwi ko this Friday kung anong rason ulit nila. Again thanks ulit 

Update: So ayun naibigay naman na, pero naman sana di nila pinatagal. Actually ngayung araw lang to naibigay, kakabalik ko lang din sa office namin from site namin.

326,LGBTQ and the workplace. ,"This just happened today. 

I recently went back to office since I changed my position in the company. For reference, I (29 M), single and closet bisexual has been WFH for a good chunk of my stay in my current workplace. 

I am usually straight passing (not a particularly good trait), but since I am bisexual it is not new. Since I started working I noticed that my field (which is engineering) is particularly peppered with “toxic masculinity” men and adherance to “macho men”. I even left one of my workplace since I had a really nasty bout of teasing for not being a “stereotypical” single man. 

Anyways, my coworker, suddenly out of nowhere said to me and I quote:

Male Coworker: “Akala ko [name redacted], alagad ka ni Krystala”

Me: “Ano yun?!”

Then followed a discussion about TV shows since I really do not know what he just said. 

Later on I asked some of my friends and they basically said that my coworker tagged me as gay. 

Anyways, I know that some of you might just say that I am just ranting because I am closeted. But being a member of the LGBTQ, I don’t really judge someone on their gender unless they say that they are straight, gay or another gender. I also believe that my gender doesn’t matter on the quality of my work or my performance. 

I would also like to add that most people had a “stereotypical” view of the members of the LGBTQ people. And would basically casually say something that are usually NSFW.

328,How's the Hazing Culture in your workplace? Worse? Better?,"A wrestling interview excerpt made me think about this

Obviously not talking about Fraternity Level Hazing (Unless you are aware of this, then please call for help), mostly in-office performances or what else na pakulo ng management na walang budget for teambuilding. I still cringe remembering being asked to crossdress to Jessie J's Bang Bang with 2 other guys. Wouldn't say it's gone though but there's less *kupals* in Lead positions now and there's no one actively pushing to dive in to gross topics and the ones being peer pressured. Definitely the move to Remote Work killed a lot of avenues sa mga manggugulang na ka co-workers and forced exposure.

Some context, I've been with my company for \~5 years by now, I've had teams come and go and my most recent staff is mostly newer younger people around my age. I don't think I've ever really had  any recent new hires go through the same embarrassment I did.  Every now and then there's still always going to be some jack-off sub-team who's assigned to do the In-Office Icebreaker who's agenda is to create something stretching the limits of what can be appropriate in an office setting.

I had a mini reunion with an older team of mine with mostly older folks who've moved on to other stuffs and most of their discussion were into raunchier in-office gossip (Like putangina sino nagchecheat sa asawa nila, sino may STD, sino sumisipsip). Makes me a bit happy that my current team of people, the raunchiest of gossip we got is like celebrity break-ups or what anime they're watching.

344,im really praying for my current company’s downfall,"i just passed my resignation letter last week and the managers that i havent spoken to suddenly messaging me that they are sad to hear about it and maybe i could just transfer teams that is more aligned to my personal goals. i personally didnt take offense at it since its a harmless way of winning back an employee

a lot of my colleagues din passed their resignation letters stating about hindi na aligned ang personap goals. tapos may pa-survey bigla about it like one of the questions is “what are your personal goals and how does this company help you?” of course spicy na usapan to sa team gc namin due to what transpired

also, i am currently suffering from a fever and asked for a sick leave today. handbook states that i cannot use leaves during 30 day render unless it is a sick leave. i asked my manager about it because usually a day leave doesnt need a med cert and now he said that they need a med cert because mondays and fridays are now critical work days?? based on our guidelines, critical working days are announced a month tapos biglang may paandar na ganito. i had to hurry up to go to the nearest doctor pero buti the csr of the hmo said use their affiliated app na lang which i did

im so pissed lang na mararanasan ko to during my render and it feels deliverate kasi sobrang imbento talaga like i even mentioned na wala sa guideline yun. i even took a SL before on a friday pero wala namang warning na ganito kaya no med cert needed

346,Am I unprofessional if I resign kung hindi ko makukuha yung promotion?,"Hello, first time posting here. Pa-rant lang. Honest opinions are welcome.

So I work as an analyst sa isang laboratory with different lines of analysis. My line manager recently resigned so basically I was left to handle everything including transactions, analysis, reports, collaborations, etc. Yung lab na hawak ko is fairly new to the company so nasa research and optimization phase pa kaya maraming colabs and consultations kaming ginagawa.

Our lab head told me na turuan ko yung isang QA namin ng processes and tests sa line ko. The thing is, the person has no background whatsoever sa line of testing namin since iba ang background and experience niya. Don’t get me wrong, willing naman siya matuto and nag-eeffort naman siya to understand what I do.

This QA person basically is at the same level nung dati kong line manager and there are whispers going around na BAKA siya ang ipalit sa line manager ko, lateral transfer ganun.

For additional background: sabay lang kami pumasok sa company nung QA person at I was also considered sa position niya at the time na nag-apply kami it’s just that mas kailangan ako sa current position ko dahil ako nga yung may background sa line of testing na needed sa lab namin.

I have nothing against kay QA person it’s just that I feel na its not fair na ako magtuturo at magtrain sa kanya tapos siya magiging head ko, like???? Ang sakin, give me a fair chance to get the position. Confident ako na I can handle the lab kasi that’s what I’ve been doing since umalis yung line manager ko. Ang unfair lang na I have to do the leg work to establish the procedures and all tapos ipapasok nila si QA as “technical expert” sa line of analysis na hindi naman niya expertise.

349,Torn Resignation letter ,"Hindi ko inaakala na kayang punitin ng boss ko yung resignation letter ko sa harapan ko mismo at itapon lang sa basurahan kahapon. I felt devastated and felt pity for myself.  Sobrang unprofessional at unethical yung ginawa niya. Pakiramdam ko nabastos ako ng harap harapan kahit nakangiti yung department head sa akin. She was assuming na I agreed on her terms kahit I na hind pa naman. Sabi ko pag-iisipan ko.

 I understand that I'm barely 2 months from my current job pero sobrang napapagod na ako mentally. Sa sobrang stress ko sumasakit na yung ulo ko araw2 to the point napapapikit na ako sa sakit. Maliban don, gusto ko din talaga umalis kasi ang toxic ng pamamalakad dito sa amin. Kung tanungin nyo pa lahat ng mga kasama ko halos lahat sila ay pareho ang opinion at may iilan na nag submit din ng resignation dahil hindi kinaya.

I decided to file a resignation early this month hindi lang dahil sa workload kundi rin sa pressure at anxiety na nakuluha ko sa mga boss ko. I had a history during my college years na I was exposed with a severe stress which caused me to suffer intolerable headaches for almost a year that I even had to consult 2 or 3 neurologists and went through CT scan. MRI pa sana kaso wala na kaming pera. Wala naman problema sabi ng doctor pero sabi niya dahil daw sa stress. 

Going back, ngayon na nandito ako sa bago kong work at lalo na dahil sa construction field yung profession ko, hindi maiiwasan na mastress ako at sumasakit na uli yung ulo ko araw-araw. Ayaw ko at ng pamilya ko na maranasan ko ulit yung sa past ko kaya pinapaalis na nila ako sa current job ko. Hindi lang naman ako nag suffer noon kundi yung pamilya ko rin. Last week i filed my resignation sa immediate head namin and she understood my situation and signed it. Yung effectivity is until the end of March. Pero yung hindi ko lang kaya is hindi ako pinapayagan umalis ng department head namin ng ganito kaaga which she just recently discovered I was filing for resignation. I was still thinking about her offer about how to solve my situation at para hindi ako umalis agad pero she just assumed na sumang ayon ako at pinunit na yung resignation letter ko. 

I'm still in probationary period. Sa pagkakaalam ko, it can go both ways for the employee and the employer. They can fire me on the spot and I can leave on the spot, tama ba?

My concern is, should I print another and have it signed kahit hanggang sa immediate head lang namin. Kasi kung ipapaakyat ko ulit sa department head namin, she made herself clear na ayaw niya akon paalisin ng ganito kaaga. And about my notice period, should I be concerned about it too, knowing na pinunit yung una kong resignation so hindi ba sya macrecredit sa 30 days notice period? My immediate head suggested to print another one na lang at kung ano yung sa tingin ko na makakabuti sa akin ay gawin ko.

Im considering na mag awol. I dont care na sa COE. I need to prioritize my health. Ayaw ko lang may hahabulin yung company ko sa akin after na umalis ako kahit hindi pirmado yung letter ko.

358,Unfair suspension.,"I just wanted some steps, ideas and to do next if I'm submitting a formal complaint against unfair suspension po saken ng company ko.

What happened is I've been suspended for 10 days now due to my supervisor unable to edit my timecard. We have what we call ADP (wherein you can timein online). I just only clocked in 30 mins prior to my shift para mabilis nalang maayos ko tools ko and everything, note: hindi po binabayaran yung 30 mins prio ko na clock in. I just want to make sure I won't forget to time-in.

Nirequest kami pumunta onsite and I'm sick. I tried to timein early online kase nga routinary lang ito. I also advised my team that I might be late due to traffic. Pagdating ko office I was late, 10 minutes. Advised my TL first verbally and nakita ko nagreflect nayung late sa system namin and advised him also sa teams with a screenshot to edit my timecard online. 

Few weeks later binabaan nila ako ng papel to be suspended, I was given chance to explain pero bulag sila sa negligence ng TL ko na hindi nya inedit timecard ko and the company is accusing me of fraud. My TL obviously didn't speak up. Sinabi pa nyang hindi daw sha nagtatago ng mga ""maling gawain"" pero obviously its his fault kahit I did not failed to notify. Alam ko pag ganto power tripping to.

I also had a case na sa system namin unable to proceed sa system namin walang case kundi iedit lang some of the details para lang makacontinue. Which is a bug. I acknowledge na fault koto nung una pero narealize ko na its the system fault din to begin with which the company failed to even acknowledge. They initially used this case as a bias para patawan ako ng 10 days suspension.

360,Work Struggles,"Hey there, here's a quick life update that no one asked for.

Lately, work has been a mental struggle for me. I find myself in a constant battle with my emotions, always on edge, angry, and hot-headed when it comes to getting my team to do what needs to be done. The tricky part is, the anger I feel at work tends to follow me home. Unfortunately, I can't seem to control or manage these emotions, and I end up lashing out at work. I used to be a hardworking and approachable person that everyone enjoyed working with. But now, my job's high pressure and unrealistic demands, leading a team of 600 people in a service industry company, have changed me.

I've raised my concerns with my boss and the CEO, who I work closely with, explaining that I often feel like I'm on the verge of a mental breakdown. Leaving isn't an option for me, as I'm the breadwinner. Despite reporting directly to them at times, no concrete actions have been taken. I'm the only manager in my team, and I don't have any relief. Moreover, despite considering our CEO a mentor, there are frequent one-on-one sessions where I'm asked for opinions beyond my work scope, and I find myself listening to work rants. This, coupled with constantly overthinking solutions even after work hours, is taking a toll on my health. I'm considering seeing a psychiatrist to regain control of my surroundings.

I want to hit the gym for my mental and physical well-being, but it's expensive, and I'm unsure where to start. Being gay adds another layer of complexity, as I feel the need to overcompensate at work due to societal differences. Even the idea of going to the gym is intimidating. I tried dating, but it hasn't been helpful – our busy work schedules leave little time for each other. I'm exhausted and hope everything falls into place soon.

364,CLOUD(under)STAFF ,"Repost kasi biglang na delete. 

BATO BATO SA LANGIT, ANG TAMAAN WAG MAGALIT ✌🏻

“#1 Workplace Everywhere” more like “#1 HELL PLACE to Work In” 

A post from a recruiter to aspiring recruiters/ employees 

First few years okay naman, close halos lahat ng nasa recruitment. 

Ff. Everything changed dahil sa new management. They hired this Filipina exec from TP (Teleperformance), now our new Recruitment Director (Dictator LOL) na nagbitbit ng 5 SENIOR managers from her old company.

Imagine, instead na mag promote internally ng deserving at yung alam talaga ang process, bagong managers ang kinuha at ang mga associates pa ang nag ttrain ng process to them 🤡 

For reference:
* TO/Talent Ops: end to end recruitment
* Sourcing team: lead generations/ phone screening only

Ever since umupo si new dictator, daming nag resign and wala pa silang pinapalit na bagong recruiters which in turn, made us more understaffed AND overworked. Those senior managers, they are part of the sourcing team and all they do is LITERALLY NOTHING. 

Imagine “senior” manager ka pero nagbibigay ka lang ng leads and not even doing any phone screening. 5 silang managers sa sourcing team with only 2 associates. Do the math lol. 

Ang ugali pa ni new dictator na girlie, kada may meeting, sobrang talas magsalita and does not even know how to say “please” or “thank you”. She likes to play politics as well. If you are a dirty worker at sipsip + you don’t challenge her opinions and beliefs on something, then congrats! you’ll be lined up for a promotion. 

This company will also force you to render OTs with NO PAY, only thank yous and their excuse would be “lack of budget”. They also laid off other recruiters before without any prior warning. Pagkagising mo, hindi ka na makapag log in kasi na laid off ka na pala. 

Again: UNDERSTAFFED, UNDERPAID, and OVERWORKED. 

They will do anythinggg just to have a good reputation, hence the tagline. Higher ups are too narcissistic to even notice the flaws and what’s really happening inside the organization.

Also, if you try to leave a (bad) review online, their marketing team will delete it. Kaya kung titingnan niyo, mataas ang ratings ni ☁️ staff sa JS or Indeed hahaha. 

Imagine 12SIL pagkakasyahin mo yon. Sa unang hire mo, makukuha mo pa yung leave credits mo after a year hihi. Minsan hindi ka pa papayagan mag leave kasi nga kulang sa tao. E malamang, imbes na mag hire ng mga recruiters, senior managers na wala namang ginagawa ang dinagdag.

To those aspiring recruiters, this company will only take out your soul and leave you heartless and lifeless. They don’t care about the people, only the number of hires mo. Kaya nga nagtataka ako bakit dream company ito ng iba. 

And to those who are thinking about applying, better think twice or maybe thrice. Madaming attrition sa mga engaged employees who are working under a client, kapag ma disengged ka you will be tagged as “performance issue” kahit na okay ka naman. They won’t listen sa mga disengaged employees and will do everything to keep their clients. Why? Because they only see those working for them as cash cows. 

So please warn those who are even attempting to apply here. This is the number 1 workplace to AVOID. ",164,60,0.98,True,Company alert 🚩,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/1bbxkdg/cloudunderstaff/,2024-03-11 15:32:14,1bbxkdg

Dinamdaman niya teh kasi feeling niya daw she was a bad friend etc. 

Anyway, maldita kasi si ate mo girl and may pagka passive aggressive so ang hilig niya magparinig halos every meeting namin pag wala boss. 

Hindi narin ako nakkipag interact sa gc namin sa slack kasi di niya ako pinapasali lol. For instance, magccomment nalang siya tapos dun niya ipapatuloy yung convo and itatag yung iba. 

This shit has been giving me anxiety like never before. Ang lala to the point na nagmamanifest na siya physically. 

Im trying to cope pero ang hirap kasi soft girlie ako and ayoko may kaaway.

Hirap rin magadjust sa work kasi magka dept kami and hindi maiiwasan interactions pero dahil nga dito, we dont talk na. 

Ayoko maghanap ng iba kasi i like my job and it pays well. 

Nagrequest nalang ako na matransfer sa ibang dept which my boss agreed naman pero for approval parin ng director namin. 

Gusto ko lang magrant kasi ang hirap haha this is just the tip of the iceberg ang dami pa nangyari. Lately lang talaga i feel left out. ☹️

373,Income o Health (as a middle child),"Hi. 26M. Middle child. 

Ang hirap magpatuloy sa trabaho na sobrang overworked at stressed ka. Umabot na sa point na araw-araw sumasakit na yung ulo ko. Parang pinipiga at pumipitik na lagi yung ulo ko sa bawat oras. Naranasan ko na ito nung college pa ako at halos isang taon ako nagdusa dito na kailang ko pa magpacheck sa mga specialist doctors to the point na I underwent CT scans and MRI. Wala naman problema pero baka daw dahil na expose ako sa sobrang stress. They told me na to avoid stress talaga which I did at eventually nawala ng ilang months pa after. Ngayon, I'm currently working in a construction company at araw-araw doon exposed ako sa stress which eventually triggered my headaches again. Stress sa workload, sa mga toxic na boss at pati sa environment. 

Sumasakit yung ulo ko weeks after my employment. Tiniis ko baka nag aadjust pa lang ako sa lahat pero kalaunan ay lumala na to the point na hindi ko ma tolerate minsan ang sakit. I filed my resignation last week dahil sa takot na lumala pa pag nagpatuloy ako sa trabaho nato at tsaka na trauma ako sa past experience ko. I could barely eat and sleep properly back at college dahil sa sakit. I was always absent for 2 semesters. Gigising na lang ako dati ng 4 am dahil biglang sasakit yung ulo ko at wala akong magawa kundi iiyak na lang. From there, I notice na parang bumaba yung stress tolerance ko. 

Ngayon, parang sinusubukan ako kasi sa 6 kami sa aming pamilya, yung mother ko lang at ako ang may trabaho. Both my parents are already senior citizens. Yung father ko naman ay retired na pero wala pang natatanggap sa kaniyang pension. Wala din siyang means to earn money. Yung ate ko naman ay naghahanap pa ng trabaho. Nabuntis kasi kaya she had to stop for a few years para maalagaan ang kaniyang anak. Yung bunso namin ay college pa. Ang hirap lang kasi maliban sa maliit lang yung income ng ina ko, sabay pa nun ay parang sunod sunod na araw parang sinusubukan kami ngayon in terms of finances. Nakakatulong din naman ako ng kaonti lalo na sa maliit kong pamangkin pero I was also watching out kung ilan na lang ang matitira sa savings ko kung sakali maka alis na talaga ako sa trabaho, which is fully decided na rin ako kasi hindi ko rin matiis magpatuloy, kasi I was planning to start a private practice kaya kailangan tight ako sa savings.

Hindi din kami mayaman. Kahit sabihin ko na average yung kita ko pero hindi kasi balanced yung ratio. 2 lang kami ang may trabaho sa pamilya. At maliit lang yung salary ng mother ko talaga. Medjo demanding din kasi yung dalawa kong kapatid when it comes to their expenses. Sobrang bait kasi ng ina ko na sige lang ng sige kung mag provide sa mga gusto nila. Ako naman, kahit ilang beses ko ipa realize sa kanila at pagsabihan ang mga kapatid ko na wag masyadong mag demand ay parang hindi pumapasok sa kanilang isipan. Ito siguro yung outcome na palagi silang bini baby noon. Actually, inamin din sa akin ng ate ko na ako talaga yung mas mature sa amin. I had to. Kasi kung hindi, kawawa ang kalalabasan namin.

Hays, I'm really praying na magkaroon ako ng big break after I resign and start my private practice para masustain ko ang family ko. May naka line up naman na mga prospective projects pero I'm praying na matutuloy. Mostly, plano pa lang kasi pero thankful parin na atleast meron. I know I'm taking a big risk at this point na magpatuloy sa resignation ko pero hindi ko kasi kayang ma compromise yung health ko. Even my mother and relatives supports me sa pag alis sa trabaho.

374,"""And other tasks as may be required"" in the job description should be illegal ","Nakakainis lang na they hire you to do one thing because you have a specific specialization/profession, tapos they'll ask you to do other things na TOTALLY unrelated sa ginagawa mo. they assigned you lang kasi ikaw pinaka free/available kahit walang kinalaman sa trabaho mo yun.

I get it in some contexts na necessary skills siguro. or mga volunteer events, company ganaps, sige gets. pero in my experience kasi, sa mga napapansin ko, and stories I've been told, mas madalas ginawa siya dahil understaffed yung office.

kung admin task na related sa work mo or sa functions ng unit mo, then go, pero yung ibibigay sayo trabaho ng ibang unit kasi kulang sila sa tao at ikaw lang available sa division, that's just unfair.

madadagdagan lang yung tasks pero yung sweldo hindi tumataas. apektado pa performance mo kasi bawas time mo to do what you actually needed to do. in the long run, mas mahal maghanap at train ng specialized staff (lalo in my industry na highly specialized but underappreciated)

told my boss about this but wala naman ding magawa.  naging lenient na lang siya sa productivity goals ko since marami nga akong other tasks sa side, but at the end of the day, lahat kasi overworked at ayaw naman mag hire ng additional na tao

Been officially unemployed for more than 6 months and job hunting has been brutal. It's been gnawing at my self-esteem and I don't have the confidence to respond to people trying to check up on me because I'm embarassed.

I applied for civil service eligibility, but because of government inefficiency and bureaucracy, I was told I have to wait for at least 5 months before getting my certificate. During this time of waiting, I missed opportunities to work in government positions, job vacancies in intergovernmental organizations, and other NGO's that preferred applicants with civil service certification. All of them required a copy of civil service certificate and all I have is a small stub of paper with my receipt attached.

I am so mad. I know it's on me for choosing not to enter corporate because I resolved for my first job to be in an organization that deals in advocacies and social development; a job with a bigger purpose beyond lining the pockets of greedy CEO's and shareholders.

I keep scrolling through my applications and I see these missed opportunities just because the government couldn't be bothered to improve governemnt service to expidite printing a piece of paper.

204,Gusto kong sumabog at magsabi ng masasamang words! :(,"Hello. So first job ko to, and I’m already working 1+ year na. This is actually a big company and I’m not gonna disclose more info about it, but I’m a designer. Medyo mahabang rant to huhuhu.

So eto na nga, super rush palagi ng mga pagawa dito. I’m okay with it naman lalo na sa fast-paced environment, since nakaka-adapt naman ako and mabilis ako magtrabaho. Nakakainis na part lang is grabe yung utos nila lagpas na sa JD ko. One afternoon, ni-rush ako ng boss ko na gumawa ng logo design, take note, di ko to trabaho since may mga designers na nakatoka dito. But my supervisor told me na wala daw nagugustuhan ang VP sa designs na prinesent nila. Kinabukasan na agad need ang logo, and sad part is first time ko siya gagawin, and walang direction or guidance man lang since yung direct supervisor ko ay di naman maalam sa technicals ng design. Since bago palang ako nun, nag self study ako ng isang oras and gumawa ng ilang draft, luckily napili yung design ko. And now ginagamit na nila yun officially. Pero wala akong natanggap na reward dun, kahit thank you nga wala. Ang sabi lang sakin, “bat mo ginalingan? sayo na tuloy mag-uutos yan hahaha” :’)

Also, super OA magwork ng lahat ng tao! 10hrs a day kami weekdays onsite, then inoobliga din magreport sa work ng weekends. Wala akong pake sa OT pay kasi mas gusto ko magpahinga and ayoko nagtatrabaho pag rest day. Nakakainis pag nagsasabi ka ng dahilan, iguguilt trip ka nila ng malala.

Another thing, since super introvert, shy, and socially anxious ako. Namimilit sila na isama ako sa mga performance, like sayaw ganyan. I told them my reasons naman na I can help with other things, pero sobra silang mang-asar. I took an SL nung christmas party kasi di ko na talaga sila kaya. Halos lahat sila extrovert and sobra akong naddrain sakanila. Tipong nagwowork ka ng maayos sa area mo, bigla may lalapit sayo tapos aasarin ka, then lahat ng attention ng tao nasayo na. I hate bida bida talaga!

But ito pinaka ayaw ko. Yung may ambagan pag may birthday/celebs. Juskoooo, halos lahat ng birthday obligado ka magbigay. Tapos ang mamahal pa ng mga binibili nila, since “sosyal” daw sila. Brooo, nagwowork nga ako para kumita ng pera, di para iwaldas sa mga surprise nila. Ang mahirap pa dun, di ka naman kasama sa planning, pero sa bayaran kasama ka. So every sahod day, parang lagi kami nagbabayad dun sa mga ambagan kapikon.

I already handed my resignation letter, kahit wala pang lilipatan. Di ko na kasi talaga kaya. And I’m looking for wfh/hybrid jobs na di ganto kagastos, and yung makakahelp sa mental health ko. When I gave my RL pala ang dami pang diskusyon bago ako payagan. Two weeks pa na-move yung date.

Last thing. During my render period, I took a 1 day SL kasi I don’t feel like working that day. Super drained ako eh. And I just recently earned my paid leaves btw. After magpaalam kay supervisor, he told me na during this period daw wag daw muna ako mag-leave kasi unfair daw sakanila yun. Ewan ko bat ganun yung word na unfair, kasi sa pagkakaalam ko almost done na ko sa tasks ko, and wala naman ako masyado need i-turnover, I can even finish all that in one day eh. But eto pa malala, I asked HR if convertible ang leaves, and sabi sakin hindi daw sya sure, upon approval daw ng upper management pero hindi 100% sure. So feeling ko naman parang dinaya ako if ever di ko gamitin leaves and di sya convertible. Ang dami pa naman nun. :(

Soooo, may nag open na Sr. Specialist role na good fit for me, and less than an hour when I applied someone was endorsed for the job description of my current role (different job title) and 33k starting.

211,I just got laid off and company is still not off boarding us,"Hi! I just want to rant. The startup company that I am working for told us last Thursday that they failed to secure an investment in which resulted to us getting laid off. I have worked for four years there and given that it's my main source of income, I am really saddened.

No hints about the lay off was given to us. A few months ago, they shared that they are applying for an investment grant and they did not tell us that the grant might make or break the company. So we really don't have any idea that we're going to be laid off few months later.

No severance pay. They said that they're still going to pay us for a month's worth. However, it's been a week since we're told about the lay off and they still don't have a specific date for our last day of work. It's really unfair because our pay period is every 24th. Beyond 24th, I will have no means of income. It means I have to be onboarded with my new job at least on the 25th.

But I am still looking for jobs. I can't really focus on finding another work if I still have responsibilities. I wanted them to offboard us as soon as possible.

231,Gusto ko ng magresign pero...,"Gusto ko na talagang magresign last year ko pa to sinasabi sa sarili ko pero napipigilan ako dahil nanghihinayang ako. Nanghihinayang ako kasi malapit na ako mag 8 years sa company sa september. Nanghihinayang ako sa benefits like HMO ng parents ko mbl 130k(though binabayran ko to less than 1k/monthly), up to 16th month pay at pag maganda ang kitaan ng company aabot 17th month, may pension plan ka na hinuhulugan si company once na umabot ka sa 5 yrs above and 5 days wellness leave on top of my sl vl conversion. Maganda naman sa Company namin kaso napakababa ng sahod at di maganda yung management sa department namin.

Eto naman yung mga dahilan bakit paulit ulit ako nagdedecide na gusto ko ng magresign.

• 7 years going to 8 pero sahod ko nasa 22k lang sobrang hindi sya enough since may bahay ako binabayaran sa pag ibig, required magbigay sa parents ko and nagbabayad din ako ng rent sa boarding house ko plus my groceries. To think di ko din alam paano ko napagkakasya ang lahat ng ito sa 22k ko monthly.

• sa tenure kong to never pa ako napromote as in never! associate pa din si ate mong pagod na. May times napapaisip ako ganun ba ako ka worst employee? pero iniisip ko naman yun pagttrabaho ko nakikita ko naman na as in ang laki ng inimprove ko like ilan lang ba napprocess ko dati sa ngayon + nadagdagan pa nga ang kota, tpos bukod sa processing may iba pa akong task nadagdag kasi SENIOR 😞.

• mandatory OT MWF SAT yung SAT 8hrs pa yun. 1 year na kaming ganito sa dec. pa 2nd anniv na. Matatapos lang daw to kapag di na kami backlog hayyy when po kaya? rest day talaga sat and sun pero dahil may assigned work na agad hangang sat wala na ako chance maenjoy yun sat rest day ko. need ko pa ipaalam ahead of time yung sat if may important ako gagawin sa buhay ko 😞

•Yung Ot ng mwf 2 hrs lang ang ibbigay pero dami ng trabaho ko nag OS(overstay not paid) ako till 9 pm even nga tth di ako maka onda ng 5 😭

•Yung TL mo na puro work lang iniisip, na parang utang ko pa pag di ako nagsabado at magrarant sya na"" hayy mag aadjust nanaman ako"" sa sobrang workaholic nya parang nakaplot na 3wks mong ttrabahuhin til sat.

•hirap mag leave ng 2 days magkasunod, ang dami pang negosasyong magaganap. Kaya may times di ko maiwasan di mag SL makapag pahinga lang at umiyak maghapon.. (Sorry sa mga TL at manager dito)

Sobrang nakakapagod pero ayun pinapaasa naman ako ni tl na nakaline up na daw ako for promotion pero di pa guarantee of this year depende dw ksi sa budget ng department at maapproved😭 worth it pa ba tong pag aantay ko ng milagro?

235,Thoughts on bad company management: Ideal Vision,"Naawa ako sa SO ko, hindi ako makapaniwala na tinitiis nya ganitong treatment sa company na ito. For context: nakita kong stressed na stressed SO ko from their shift, nung dumating sa bahay eh haggard na sa byahe at nakutuban ako na di maganda naging araw nya sa work dahil nung nag breakfast pa kami ng sabay eh ok naman sya. At bilang concerned na SO I did my due diligence, inalam ko kung kamusta trabaho nya. When I tell you how emotional my SO was after ko sabihin yun, gulat na gulat ako. Doon na sya nag simula mag kwento na nag message yung manager nila about sa attendance na di daw sila pwede mag off kesyo daw di “nababantayan” galit na sinabi ng SO ko: “Samantalang yang manager na yan mas madalas pang mag leave kesa sa aming lahat combined!!! Ang kapal pa ng mukha nyan at kumukuha ng pambayad ng mga inoorder nya online sa pera ng store! Idagdag mo pa na yung ibang  for display na eyeware eh kinuha nyan at ginagamit nya for personal use kasi need nya daw pag nagmamaneho sya!!!” Sa totoo lang di ko inasahan yung ganung level ng pag kwekwento nya gawa ng malumanay itong SO ko so it only goes to show na matagal na syang nagtimpi. After nun sinabi ng SO ko habang nagpupunas ng luha eh: “Bebi, hindi ko na alam kung hanggang saan ako dito sa work, alam mo ba na wala kaming HMO at medical. Kaya nung nilagay mo ako as an extension sa mga beneficiaries super tuwa ko sa iyo.” Sabi ko: “Bebi seryoso ka ba? Ang alam ko required by law na magkaroon kayo nyan, paanong wala kayo eh regular employee ka na?” Sabi ni SO: “Mas may benefits pa nga mga blue collar employee kaysa sa amin. Mental health ko nga nauupos na kasi kahit madaling araw nag message ang manager kaya kahit dapat pahinga na eh dadag pa sa mga isipin, tapos pag duty naman eh pag nasa staff area kami napaka sikip, dugyot akala nga nung isa kong friend na nag VC sa akin nasa warehouse ako. Hiyang hiya ako, gusto ko nang umalis bebi kaso hindi ko kayang matigil kasi nag papadala pa ako sa mga kapatid ko sa province.” After nung kwento nya wala na akong nagawa kundi yakapin sya, awang awa ako.

Hi guys, Question lang? Is it possible na iterminate ako ng HR manager ko dahil daw buntis ako? I’m 2 months pregnant btw and I have a japanese boss na hindi marunong umintindi ng english he has a translator but that translator disclose information sa group ng HR’s namin dahil sila lang ang magkakacircle of friends. Anyway back to the topic I have a friend of mine sa office namin na translator din and guess what narinig nya last friday na pinaguusapan ng HR MANAGER ko at ng boss ko na japanese na iteterminate nga daw ako dahil buntis ako at wala pa benefits and under agency nga lang daw ako. Nung lumapit daw ung translator friend ko is HR MANAGER ko and nagsalita na “Gusto kasi ni sir na iterminate si blah blah blah” sinangkalan nya ung boss ko na japanese at ito daw ang may kagustuhan na alisin ako to think na last friday ko lang din sinabi sa boss ko na japanese na preggy nga ako oras palang ang lumipas and yet ung boss ko na japanese is nagdecide agad na alisin ako ganun ba yorn!? Ang sabi daw ng boss ko na japanese is pagiisipan nya pa ung sinasabi ng HR MANAGER ko na aalisin ako. Anyway, till May nalang ung boss kona japanese and may papalit na new boss japanese ulit so si Translator number 1 na nagdidisclose sa mga close friends nya ng information is possible na mawala or if magstay pa is questionable na dahil wala naman na sya itatranslate pa dahil ung papalit na new boss is fluent na magenglish. I guess na sya ang papalit sakin kaya gusto nila ako tanggalin. And my Friend na Translator din is rendering nalang sya till mid of april dahil nagresign na sya. Mga ka-HR i need your opinion about this. And it is possible ba talaga? I forgot to mention nga pala na we are not close ng manager ko since gusto nya ako sumama sa circle of friends nila na mga HR pero masasama ugali at pinupulutan ang buhay ng iba. I do my job professionally of course transparent lang ako sakanila thats why gusto nya ako alisin na nakikita ko is hindi nya ako magawang tuta nya.",16,23,0.88,True,Advice Needed 🤔,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/1bgn7gg/termination_dahil_buntis/,2024-03-17 10:48:10,1bgn7gg

239,"""The audacity"" to file a VL","Ang kapal na pala ng mukha mo ngayon pag nag file ka ng VL tapos so-so lang performance mo. Ang only incentive na makukuha mo pag top ka sa OVERALL metrics ay 1,500, which is available lang sa top 3 (may 80 agents sa account, dati 50, kaya kahit may limang mag VL sa isang araw, meron pang mga around 15 agents na maiiwan na kayang kaya ihandle ang inbox). Ngayon ginawa ding incentive pagfafile ng VL. Pag nasa gitna ka lang ng ranking kahit pasado  lahat ng metrics mo, asa ka pa kahit wala namang ibang inapprove sa araw na yun.  Kala mo naman pagkalake lake ng sahod, 17k lang naman kasama na allowance jan, walang monetary performance incentive (aside sa 1500 sa top 3). Wala ding annual increase, binawasan pa sweldo imbis lakihan.

Wala ding growth dahil ayaw mag promote. 80 agents gusto isang QA lang ang maghandle dahil ang ratio daw ng QA ay 1:50agents kaya kaya pa daw. 6 months na apprenticeship umabot na ng 1 taon wala parin. Yung  trainer nahihirapan din mapromote kase resting headcount na yung 80, hindi madalas maghire, every sale lang tapos kada sale yung client pa mismo nagtetrain. 

Ang maganda lang doon,  pag nagtagal ka ng isang bwan madali nalang yung , kabisado mo na lahat, tapos non voice pa. Emails hindi live chat.

240,Kinakawawang music industry at tanginang mga barat dito sa pinas: frustrated— kuwentong 200php/night job,"Sorry di magaling magkuwento. Di ko alam kung ito ba ang tamang venue to rant. Pero medyo frustrated pa rin ako sa kinikita ng mga musicians dito sa Pilipinas. I went my boyfriend's gig last night— alongside, a well-known singer here in the Philippines. Imagine from QC, bumiyahe kami to South. But for transpo— due to the instruments they had to bring along, transportation costs around 1.5k for two cars. On the return trip, it was another 1.7k(??) for two cars ulit.

Pagdating ko sa venue, sikat naman. Yayamanin. Di siya lugi sa isang gabing bentahan. May malaking billboard nga eh. Malaki ang kinikita, marami rin ang nagpupunta. I spent around 2k just on liquor—1 Jim Beam, 1 bacardi shotglass, 4 beers, and that didn't even include food. In one night, they will probably earn 70K. Di sila lugi sa entrance dahil 500php+ din 'yun!

Nagulantang lang ako dahil nung natapos na tumugtog 'yung band ng boyfie ko, I noticed a look of despondency on his face. He told me that their compensation was disappointingly low, barely covering the transportation expenses. 5 sila sa banda. When I probed about the exact amount, they had only received 3000php as Talent Fee. 3K PER BAND, mamsh!

To put this into perspective, me spending fuckin' liquors at the venue exceeded what each band member was paid. They are on par with the renowned singer in terms of talent. As graduates of the College of Music at UP Diliman, they have exceptional skills naman— including in their compositions. Sobrang galing sa JAZZ! Jazz kasi forte nila.

Nakakalungkot lang to witness the severe exploitation of musicians' here in the Philippines, especially when three of them don't even have other means of income, grabe sobrang nakakabanas.

You probably wouldn't lose anything if you paid the musicians fairly! Nakakainis lang pag naaalala ko na ang mamahal ng menu/at napakadami niyo namang pera, pero di niyo man lang mabayaran ng maayos kapwa ninyo. Sobrang naiiyak ako. I told him na ""sige lang, makakaahon rin tayo, we'll find gigs with better pay eventually, ha?"" pero sabi niya lang, ""matagal pa 'yan, mahal"" 

Ayun— niyakap ko nalang boyfriend ko pagkauwi. It's just sad to see him so exhausted for just 200php last night. I love you so much, mahal! (KUNG MABASA MO MAN 'TO) Sorry. Di ko na kinaya di mag rant. 🤕

But then I was diagnosed with Lupus (Same as Kris Aquino) which I know pang mayaman. I was admitted sa hospital for 40 days from December to Feb this year. Dami kasing tests na naconduct para madetermine yung sakit ko. Yun din ung reason why I'm physically weak since na decondition ung katawan ko dahil sa pagkakahiga sa ICU nang matagal. 

Now I'm under several medications and maintenance. I became depressed gusto ko magwork tho I don't think na I'm still fit to work pa since sa case ko maraming affected organs ang nadamay ng sakit (kidneys, blood, and ung heart rate ko is tumaas. Not to mention yung physical state ko as of the moment. Laki ng pinayat. There are times na sobrang lutang ako due to medication or baka dahil na rin sa Lupus ko.)

243,Asking for an advice,"asking for advice

As the title itself says, I am asking for an advice to any of you here folks. Medyo mahaba to kaya bear with me. 

I started my job to this company in our city last June 09,2023. Btw, telco pala to. It was very nice to be in this company and campaign dahil chill lang tho I came from telco before which is prepaid then ngayon postpaid na. Okay yung management before, okay rin yung 2 TLs ko kasi the first was transferred to nesting and the latter, resigned due to personal reasons. We were transferred to another TL last Dec 4 and the dilemma starts here. 


Ang lala ng ugali ng TL nato and di mo maintindihan kung moody ba or masama lang talaga ugali niya. Ayaw nya ng late pero sya mismo late. Since kami yung na add sa team nya, sinasabi niya sa OM na bakit sila daw mag aadjust sa RD eh number 1 sila sa cluster and turns out, hindi sila number one and second to the last sila sa ranking. Anyways, this is irrelevant na. Going back, pag may supcall, super nakakairita sya na parang ang sarap niyang sakalin. Naiintindihan ko naman na kailangan mag de escalate pero ayaw na talaga ng customer and gusto niya ng supervisor pero ayaw niyang tanggapin at tatawagan daw si customer within the day tapos pag may dsat, ikaw pa sisisihin kesyo ganyan,ganto. Ang stressful sobra. 


Then December came, we transitioned from billing CSR to Sales na as per business needs ng employer namin. Dito, stress na stress na ako. Di ako nakakahit sa quota pero di rin naman ako na zero sa sales. Ang malala pa, pag di ka nakakahit sa quota, di ka allowed mag leave kahit deserve mo yan. As in, everyday pumapasok na lang ako para sa bills and may araw rin na nagkakasagutan kami ng TL na yan kasi sama pa ng ugali, siya pa ang reason bakit masisira araw mo. Wala man lang ni or hello, good morning, rants agad at walang katapusan niyang mga pang mamaliit sa amin. Ang siste nung ni report sa OM anong sabi? Nobody is perfect and give us the chance to serve you. Planning to switch to another company na.


So for the golden question, should I stay or resign na? 


Ps. I’ve been planning to resign immediately and the reason kung bakit nag cocontemplate pa ako is baka di matanggap 😭

245,Stigma against people from corporate world to business venture,I just recently resigned to my corporate job. I've been in the industry for 7 years and this last company I encountered some not so pleasant experience like racism and napag initan ako ng Lead ko also some Malaysian and Singaporean Managers were rude to me and I can feel the preferential treatment they have with their own people. Out of all the companies I've been it's my first time experiencing this and it was tolerated by management or no action was done even after reporting so I resigned. I have savings as fallback naman but I've always wanted to do business because I don't see corporate job as a long term venture for me. I'm just scared that if my former colleagues saw my upcoming posts for business is they'll judge me or think I'm going broke so I did business. Since the stigma for people leaving corporate and joining the business world is not that great because it's not as stable as corporate. Nakita ko na kc yung ganitong scenario sa iba Kong mga kawork before and ang comment nila is 'Babalik din Yan sa corporate world haha tingnan mo pag pumalpak business nyan babalik yan satin'.

248,Anong mga ginawa mo ngayong araw?,"I just wanna share my experience from my previous job. Napaka bagsik kasi ng ""immediate supervisor"" ko. Until now kasi pag may nakikita akong post regarding sa file ng leave na titrigger pa din ako. I've been working in manila for almost 2 months pa lang and first time ko lang din sa corporate world magtrabaho so wala akong alam sa mga rights ko that time and wala akong pake coz nakafocus ako para kumita ng pera. So, one time nag file ako ng 2 days leave dahil birthday ng anak ko and gusto kong umuwi sa province namin dahil na hohomesick na rin ako. After ko magfile ng leave kinausap ako ng immediate supervisor ko na bakit daw ako mag li-leave ng 2 days. So nagpaliwanag ako and nabanggit ko din na 2 months na kong hindi nakakauwi sa amin and na hohomesick na din ako sa manila, since wala naman ako malapit na kamag-anak dito or kaibigan, then, I thought maiintindihan ako ng ""immediate supervisor"" ko kasi taga probinsya din siya, instead, sabi niya lang sakin ""ako nga ilang years na kong hindi umuuwi sa probinsya namin, hindi naman ako nag file ng leave"". So pinagpaubaya ko nalang yon. Hindi ako umuwi ng 1ST BIRTHDAY ng anak ko dahil sa sinabi niya. Instead na magalit ako e. Tinatak ko pa sa isip ko na siguro ang hina lang ng loob ko kaya ako nahohomesick at dapat maging gayahin ko siya kasi ina- idolized ko pa siya that time (after ilang days nakausap ko yung ka work ko na matagal na din sa company, binanggit niya sakin na kaya hindi umuuwi ng province si ""IS"" dahil kasama niya pala yung family niya dito sa Manila. But still, I let it pass nalang. Pero after 2 weeks, nung naaksidente father ko. Naka duty ako that time. Exactly 2:23 P.M tumawag sakin kapatid ko and wife ko na naaksidente yung father ko. So nagsabi agad ako sa ""immediate supervisor"" ko (rinig na rinig niya while umiiyak wife ko habang sinasabi niyang naaksidente father ko). But guess what? Ang sinabi sakin ni ""IS"" ""bakit? Ano bang mga ginawa mo ngayong araw? Ilista mo mga ginawa mo bago ka umalis!"" (With a pagalit tone pa siya). So, kahit kating kati ako umuwi e ginawa ko pa rin yung sinabi niya kasi akala ko dati may rights siyang ganunin ako. Then nung nakauwi na ko sa province, nagmadali ako pumunta sa hospital. Then kinuwento ko sa kapatid ko yung scenario at doon niya pinaliwagan lahat ng rights ko as a worker.  after a week nag decide ako magresign, kinausap pa ko ni ""IS"" na pag-isipan mabuti kasi hindi na daw ako makakakuha ng opportunity na kagaya ng offer nila, which is a minimum wage salary lang naman tapos hindi pa bayad yung OT pagka hindi ka umabot sa 1 hour and kung magpapatama ka naman para maka 1hour pupunahin ka maigi ni ""IS"". 

So to all workers jan. If your boss doesn't approve your filed leave. That company is not worth it. Always choose yourself and family, dahil kayang kaya ka palitan ng company na pinapasukan mo. Pero yung family, time and moment with them will stay forever with your heart.

260,"“You don’t need time to prepare, tambay ka lang naman diba?”","skl but this is how i dodged a bullet, fresh grad ako and the job hunt was a humbling experience for me, sa sobrang happy ko and i can’t think straight that time when i received an invite for final interview, sobrang desperate na din for a job kasi nahihiya ako sa family ko, although hindi naman ako pinepressure ng fam ko pero as a fresh grad na “i dont want them to see me as a failure”, kahit anong field papasukin ko as an engg grad

i received invite for final interview from a local supplier ng oil sa city namin so happy ako kasi align to sa course ko, sinabihan ako ng head, ‘you’re hired’ sobrang dali ng process tbh halos 1-2 weeks from initial to final interview via online

He asked me if ano daw salary range ko, i told him na expected salary ko is 18k-22k yan kasi typical salary range for fresh-grad and entry level samin area, then he told me na “wala ka pang experience, 12k nalang yan, yan ganyan na salary range pang may experience na yan”, yung inapplyan ko is Project Site Coordinator, then he keeps talking parang na down ako, still the stupid in me “hoy atleast may trabaho kana” 

Add ko lang, Final interview ko friday, he told me start na daw ako, next week, Monday, so gulat ako kasi wala pa akong preemployment reqs/onboarding reqs, i even had to pay for medical expenses. I told him to give me time para makapag ready and submit my reqs since some clinics and govt offices are closed weekends, then he told “You dont need time to prepare, tambay ka lang naman”, verbal din yung job offer, hindi ko sila sinabihan na ‘yes i take the offer’, i even told them to give me time to think about the offer still the same response “bat pagiisipan pa? di ba wala kang job? blessing na to”, working hours din din is Mon-Sat 8:00am-5:00pm pero may times daw na 6:00am to 1am need magreport, yikes tas 12k lng offer?? lol

Sobrang red flag talaga, I kept on smiling and waited for the interview to end, ghosted them, yung HR tawag ng tawag and text ng text haha if tatanggapin ko ba daw yung offer, and now im currently working sa oil industry, and appropriate salary for a fresh grad 26k, they also gave me a month to prepare for my docs for onboarding and paid my transpo and medical expenses, goods na din salary kasi libre lunch and transpo, Mon to fri 8-5pm, and sobrang bait ng boss kasi if 4:30pm sinasabihan na kami to rest na para to prepare to clock out

 some employers sobrang bully and pangit ang mindset towards fresh grad, until now di ko parin yun malilimutan sinabi niya, lumala din anxiety ko doubted myself even more but now okay na ako pero nandun pa rin yung trauma haha, gago talaga yun na employer ",231,22,0.98,True,Story 🗣️,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/1bin2qx/you_dont_need_time_to_prepare_tambay_ka_lang/,2024-03-19 23:33:29,1bin2qx

nag-complain na ako sa company, now di ko alam if this is them being passive aggressive na they're still not giving it kasi nag-complain ako or what.

i thought decent kasi from outside mukhang maayos yung company, and they're quite known. Tapos ganito pala trato nila sa illustrators nila.

266,Termination due to disease/illness,"2 yrs mahigit na ko sa company namin. Last year, around July, nadiagnose ako with cancer. Nung una, pinapayagan nila ko mag-WFH since sa support naman kami. 

Pero around last week ng July, pinapabalik na nila ko sa office. Sinabi ko sa kanila na hindi ko na kaya physically magcommute (office is sa Makati; bahay is Bulacan) so nagrequest ako na kung pwede magWFH muna ko hangga't kaya ko and while naghihintay sa chemo session schedule. Hindi sila pumayag kasi unfair daw sa ibang employees. Binigyan nila ko ng options: it's either magoffice na ko or magindefinite leave na ko. Ayoko pa sanang magleave since medyo kaya ko pa naman magwork kahit WFH sana pero wala akong choice kasi di ko naman kaya yung travel paoffice. So, August 1, I filed my indefinite leave. 

After 7 months, they contacted me again and asked me about my plans. Nakakailang sessions na rin ako sa chemotherapy pero hindi pa rin bumabalik sa dati yung katawan ko, dagdag pa yung mga complications every after session. So I told them na gusto ko na sana bumalik ng work because yung finances namin is hindi na okay pero currently, hindi pa possible. Tinanong nila ako about sa prognosis ko and wala pa rin talaga akong masabi sa ngayon kasi unpredictable pa rin yung condition ko. Sabi nung admin namin, they've been arranging the organizational chart daw and hindi nila alam kung saan ako ilalagay kasi floating daw yung position ko (which is I think is not true kasi hindi naman limited sa kung ilan lang yung pwede magkaroon ng job title na kagaya nung sakin sa company namin), so inask ulit nila ako kung ano daw sa tingin ko yung pwedeng gawin if hindi pa rin daw pala ako sure kung kailan ako makakabalik. 

Alam ko that time na they know na ang sagot pero gusto lang nila na sakin manggaling so I answered, ""Resignation"". Which is alam ko na pagkakamali kasi I could've answered ""terminate nyo nalang po ako"". 

If termination due to disease, may makukuha pang separation pay hindi po ba? Did they just got me into saying resignation para hindi na sila magbayad ng separation pay? May definite po ba sa law natin kung ilang months lang pwede nakaindefinite leave yung employee? Ano po kaya yung magandang gawin dito sa situation na ito? Thank you in advance po sa sasagot.

270,Unprofessional recruitment process. (Int Company-Au),"I don’t know if dapat bako mainis pero nakakainis sobra. Nasayang oras at araw ko. 

I applied sa isang company na base in Au pero meron dto sa ph. They invited me for an initial interview last march 13 and since nagka conflict ako on that day and time. I tried to reschedule the interview. So tinry ko yung link for scheduling na mag resched yung calendly ata yun pero may error message so I decided to email the recruiter na contact person ko so I emailed her and I asked her na mag re-reschedule ako for next week — March 20 (same day, same time) and she responded with “ It’s fine, just use the same link for rescheduling.” I got confused kasi sinabi ko na sakania sa unang email ko na hndi nag wowork yung rescheduling link so I emailed her back and clarified if meant nya ba is yung link na inischedule nya before which is the google link, but sadly “NO RESPONSE” As the days pass, no email from her regarding my concern or if close or open pa yung position so I still assumed that my initial interview will be still on going. 

Mar 20 nag decide ako mag halfday because I’m still assuming na tuloy pa rin yung interview since wala pa naman akong natatanggap na email from the HR manager na hndi na tuloy. Gumising ako maaga, nag prepare and 15 mins before the interview nag email ako sa HR and tell her na nasa meeting room nako ng (google meet) and guess what nag email back sya ng “I don’t have schedule with you today. I am sorry to inform you that the position has been ALREADY FILLED”

Like wt. Napaka unprofessional kasi yung tone ng email nya is parang wala syang alam na nag pa resched ako and she confirmed it. First time
ko lang kasi ma encounter so bear with me guys. Go judge me if may mali sa side ko pero swear nakaka dismaya haha sayang effort, oras, at araw.

271,Pinagbabawalan mag-LEAVE ng company ,"Last year, once lang ako nakapag-leave. 

Starting late last year, the management decided to not let employees take their paid time offs. Their reasoning is because of shrinkage of teams and high volume of tasks, automatically rejected ang lahat ng mag-file ng leave. Some are getting crafty by doing a sick leave instead. But now they require med cert from a face to face consult. Btw, yung mga nasa management can still take their paid time offs. They're not affected by their own leave policy.

My question is, legal pa ba ito? Pwede bang pagbawalan mag-leave ang lahat ng empleyado?

I'm 22M who recently graduated from college last January 2024, and I'm feeling an overwhelming sense of nostalgia for my college days. As an irregular student, I've always felt a bit out of sync with my batchmates. While they were already working, I found myself pressured to jump into the workforce as well. However, now that I'm a few months into my job, I can't help but think that maybe I needed some time to rest and recharge before diving into the professional world.

Currently, I'm caught in an existential crisis. On one hand, I feel the weight of societal expectations and the pressure to continue working. On the other hand, I yearn for the carefree days of college and wonder if I should take a break to regain my energy and find clarity.

Should I continue pushing myself through the pressure and fulfill my work obligations, or would it be wise to finish my current contract and take some time off to rest and reflect? I'm torn between these two options, and your input could be invaluable in helping me make an informed decision.

TL;DR: I recently graduated as an irregular student and feel pressured to start working immediately.

And we just know today na di pala kami pasuswelduhin (messaged them, seen lang kami)

[Short backstory: We saw their ad on FB, Virtual Assistant, Advertiser, Secretary, Data Entry/Encoder, and Photo/Video Editor ang hanap nila so we applied. We didnt know na unregistered sila at nagtatago sa BIR until a week into the job. Kaya pala halos 4 kaming sabay na bago kasi puro nagreresign tao nila. Mga lalaki na kaanak ni boss lang natitira lagi]

I want to report all their wrong doings, but IDK how and where to start. Lalo na at a friend who previously worked there told us na malakas sila sa DOLE at BIR dahil tinutulungan ng kaanak na lawyers. 

Here are their violations (that we know):

• Unregistered E-commerce Business. Expired license (pinatago kami once, dahil may inspection pala at dapat 1-2 employees lang makita)

• Hacked one of our FB accounts days after resigning, then proceeded to harass and fire 5 employee dahil sa nabasa sa gc nila

• They illegally purchase and consume 100+ sims daily

• Force us to use our own ID to make bank accounts na sila ang gumagamit (ranging from 3-5 banks each nagawa namin na nakapangalan samin/fam namin pero sila gumagamit)

• Our tasks includes creating dummy accounts for them daily

• Sexual harassment by said boss to most of us. Ate Secretary - pwinersa halikan ilang beses (also happened to the maid). then dinala somewhere in disguise of work daw pero resort pala and nilalasing lang sya all throughout the ride. Then ilan saming mga babae hinahawakan sa tagiliran, balikat, aakbayan without our consent + despite us saying NO repeatedly 

• Verbal and physical abuse sa kinakasama/mistress nyang BUNTIS. Sa harap pa namin + sa gc binubully ni boss. Then a few times umiimik si girl na may pasa pa raw sya at masakit katawan na (the office is inside their home, katabi ng bedroom nila kaya rinig namin pag sinasaktan o minumura ni boss)

• Hired a minor girl na di nakatapos then pays her 350-400 pesos only (city rate dapat)

• Forces us to drink during duty, ang di uminom/malasing di nya pauuwiin

• Wont give our backpay

I'm a Junior Interior Designer. Nag-wowork ako for a Architecture + Interior Design Firm. However, ang Architecture Team namin is composed of 5 people (2 seniors and 3 regular employees) plus 3 OJTs. Sa Interior Design Team, 2 lang kami doon (1 senior and me na regular lang). Obviously, sobrang lamang ang Architecture Team namin at sobrang lugi kami sa Interior Design Team. 

Yung Senior Interior Designer namin, parating wala and late pumapasok ng office kaya lahat ng trabaho niya binibigay niya sa akin. Nagpapatong-patong na mga gawain ko na nasisira na time management ko. Ako na sumasalo ng work niya pero ang pay ko ay hindi pang-senior. Lately, nagtanong HR namin sa Senior Interior Designer namin kung nahihirapan na ba ako sa mga workload ko. Sabi ng Senior Interior Designer, ichecheck niya raw. Kaya nagtatanong HR namin kasi balak niya mag-hire pa ng isang Junior Interior Designer

So nagtanong nasa akin Senior ko kung nabubulunan na ba ako sa workload ko. Sumagot ako na nahihirapan na ako kasi sabay-sabay ang demands sa akin tas ang dami rin pasingit na work kasi sinasalo ko na work ng Senior ko. Hindi ako pinakinggan ng Senior ko at sinabi niya sa akin na ""Kaya mo yan. Dapat masanay ka na"". Sumabat pa yung isang Senior from Archi Team at sinabi sa akin na ""Dapat mag-step up ka na. Sa totoo lang, di ka naman talaga nahihirapan. Nabibigla ka lang sa mga nangyayari"". Magsasalita pa ako kung ano pa nararamdaman ko kaso cinut-off ako ng Senior ko na parang pinapalit niya ang topic. 

Nakakainis lang na nagtatanong pa sila sa akin kung okay pa ako pero di naman ako papakinggan. Ginaslight pa nila ako. Kaya ang ending, hindi na mag-hihire HR namin ng isa pang Junior Interior Designer kasi mas pinakinggan nila yung Senior ko na parating wala at di naman ako binabantayan.

Sorry, gusto ko lang kasi ilabas yung sama ng loob ko dahil sobrang toxic nila kaya ito ang nagtutulak sa akin na mag-resign na",6,8,1.0,True,Rant 😡,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/1bkb5vt/iniignore_ng_mga_boss_and_seniors_ko_ang_mga/,2024-03-22 00:49:07,1bkb5vt

I work in a supervisory position as part of the operations. Sa nature ng work, hindi pwedeng walang kapalitan or mabakante. I already understand that ""just work within your time"" and all but that's not the issue.

Sa scheduling namin, usually may overlap ang duty - around 1.5hrs. But due to issues beyond my paygrade, saktuhan na ang oras - like if you end ng 5pm, the next starts at 5pm. Kaso nagkaroon ng culture ng matuusin ang mga tao rito ang eventually even yung mga supervisor and managers are doing the same, Honda sa pasok kasi may unpaid overtime daw since nageextend daw sila after ng duty hours nila. Then, comes the IRR of the service charge law recently release last Feb na apektuhan ang service charge ng mga employee. Lalo na naging matuusin sila sa oras.

Pero meron silang olympics kung sino ang pinaka dikit sa bago malate pagdating sa biometrics. Like, yeah, hindi ka nga late pero paalis na ako. What's worse? Pag di naintindihan yung turnover, tatawagan ka pa after office hours. Magagalit pa yan pag di maayos yung turnover kaya mapipilitan ka din magextend hanggang maintindihan yung gusto mong sabihin kahit full effort na plain as day na naipasa sa kanila yung turnover.

IMO, I'm not requesting them to come in very early before the time but at least give a damn to come in at most 5mins before the time. At least may condensed version na ng turnover ang maibigay sa inyo. It is the respect towards sa oras ng ibang tao, hindi kunpanya. 

Thanks for hearing me out.

124,Ayaw ibigay ang sahod according to their company policy daw,"My girlfriend was hired as a trainee at a local VA agency. Base sa agreement na pinirmahan nya para maging regular kailangan nya makapagbigay ng 3 appointments sa client within 10 days at doon lang din ibibigay yung trainee salary nya. After 10 days wala pa rin syang appointment na nakukuha pero binigyan pa rin sya ng chance, pero yung kasabayan nya din na trainee ay na natanggal na kasi hindi din sya nakapagbigay ng appointment. Kaya pala nabigyan sya ng chance kasi nagustohan ng may ari kung paano sya mag salita.

After 13 days of total work nagpasa na sya ng resignation letter through email. Dahil ilang araw na walang perang pumapasok at kailangan nya din magbayad ng bills sa bahay. Tapos nag follow up na sya sa HR kung kelan makukuha yung trainee salary nya at nakailang email pa sya kasi ayaw pansinin ng HR yung messages nya. After 5 days nag reply na HR nila tapos sabi na hindi daw babayaran yung 13 days kasi hindi daw na meet ang standards at expectations sa training program base sa company policy nila.

Ngayon nag email ako sa kanila gamit ang account ng gf ko, sinabi ko na kailangan ko makita yung company policy na sinasabi nila. Sa ngayon waiting pa ako sa reply nila.  
Ang tanong ko lang kung may laban ba kami at kung ano sunod dapat gagawin.

128,Contract vs Labor Code,"For context, I was hired last year as a senior web developer, things are actually pretty good with this company other than the contract and schedule arrangements.  


So last year nung 2 months palang ako sa company, my employer sent me an email notifying me that the contract was amended so that developers are only paid with a fixed amount, essentially removing holiday premium pay, night differential pay, and RDOT pay, in exchange for what they call ""flexible time"".  
The first few months with the new contract was actually fine lang kase the normal work schedule ng development team namin is around 3pm to 11pm, and we are seldom asked to stay late lang talaga, and if ever we have to stay late, we can offset a few hours of work for the next day. So we thought di masyadong big deal yung contract...

However, pagkadating ng around late november, dun na kami nagka issue sa contract... Kase medyo cramming na kami sa deadlines on phase 1 completion ng project. So basically, dun ko napansin na inaabuso na ng management ang contract arrangements namin. We are asked to work na starting 8pm to 4am every day. Which I think is the first breach nila sa contract arrangement without night differential pay... Then come the holidays, sinagad talaga yung workhours namin, minsan kahit sa weekends and some non-working-holidays pinapa work parin kami para lang daw makuha yung deadline, pero ang masaklap walang RDOT pay, at holiday premiums... There were also like 3 weeks sa early 2024 na pinapunta kami sa office every day, and palagi overtime pa, para lang daw makaabot sa deadline. Though nilibre naman nila lunch namin that time, pero I think di parin justified yung hours na tinatrabaho namin para lang dun... Then early february, sinabihan na talaga kami na graveyard schedule (10pm to 6am) na daw kami until further notice until now...   


Palagi ko binabanggit sa team leads meeting namin with HR yung issue about sa contract at kung pano inaabuso ng management (CTO) namin ang contract... Pero parang wala parin movement sa HR ehh.. Since January ko pa ni re-raise yung concern ko about the missing benefits as per Labor Code, pero wala talaga movement ehh kase parang sunod-sunoran lang din si HR ng CTO and CEO na Americans...   


Ano ba pwede ko gawin as manggagawa? :( Burn out na ako sa kaka trabaho ng gabi, holiday, and sometimes weekends, tapos kulang pa yung binabayad...  


Ngayong holy week sa 28 and 29, tinanong ko kung ano arrangements namin sa work, sabi work parin daw kami 10pm to 6am, tapos offset nalang daw sa following weeks ng di sabay sa ibang team members.. Ni raise ko yung concern na dapat yung holiday offset is equivalent sa 4 days na no work kase supposedly double pay yan ehh... Kaso, nireject yung proposal ko, kase dapat 2 days lang parin and offset na mga araw... Sarap mang away ng CTO talaga.. :(

&#x200B;

Pero ano ba choice ko? pinapasweldohan lang naman ako.. :( Irereport ko na talaga sila sa DOLE.. :( Pero gusto ko lang malaman kung nasa tama ba ako, or kung ano recommendations nyo sakin..

After 3 months, binigyan siya project and sinama ako ng manager. Simple lang yung project. Kayang-kaya gawin in just 3-5 days. 

Nababadtrip ako sa kanya. Every time may tanong siya, sakin ang diretso. Oks lang naman magtanong, pero buti sana kung chat lang. Tawag ang ginagawa niya. Wala na tanong-tanong kung available ako. Rekta call. Tapos mga tanong kayang-kaya i-google eh. Ang bilis niya rin mairita at mahilig magmura kapag kami lang nasa call.

Sinabi ko rin na nung nag-aadjust ako sa work tinitingnan ko or pinag-aaralan ko mga projects na ginagawa ng team para may idea ako pano ba sila magwork or magconstruct ng idea. Lagi niya sinasabi ayaw daw niya manggaya, gusto niya from scratch. 

Expect ko kasi sa batikan na sa industriya alam na pano dumiskarte para madaling magawa trabaho eh. Pero siya gusto spoon-feed.

130,Can file a complaint in DOLE?,"Hi, asking for a friend kasi wala syang reddit. 

She called me yesterday telling me na suspended sya for 30 days just because of the uniform. Basically pumasok sya ng maaga kahapon kasi her boss asked her na pumunta ng bahay nila to get some files daw. Pagbalik nya ng office nagkita sila don and nakita daw uniform nya. Tinanong sya bakit ung luma na uniform ung sinuot nya. Sa apartment kasi namin 14 kami so ung paglalaba ang hirap kasi walang scheduling tapos ung may ari ng bahay madami pa nalabahan kesa samin na tenant, ending di sya nakalaba ng uniform nya kaya ayun nasuot nya. 

So yung boss nya tinanong daw sya if bakit hindi nagpalaundry. Sagot daw nya kasi mahal ang laundry which is true naman mahal laundry sa area namin. Then nanahimik na lang daw sya tapos sinundan sya ng boss nya at nagdadakdak na kesyo single naman walang sinusuportahan na pera bakit daw ang mahal mahal ng laundry para sa kanya. Knowing her salary which is minimum plus di bayad OT nya nagrereklamo pa boss nya pag finafile, di sya enough kasi senior na parents nya at some point pinapadalahan nya din. 

So to cut things, dahil parang lagi na lang daw iniissue ng boss nya yung pagiging single nya, nasagot na daw nya na may pagka disrespect. Kasi sabi nya parang napuno na din daw sya and she's been with them for 9 years. Pinadalahan sya ng letter same day kahapon na suspended no pay sya. Wala daw sila handbook na may policy for suspension and uniform. As in no handbook at all pero may ground for suspension. So if ever pwede ba sya mag file ng complaint sa DOLE?

131,"Nakakainis yung mga ""leaders"" sa team namin","Di kasi ako makamove on talaga on how my colleagues acted today. We have this monthly business review kasi, and isa ako sa main person na magconduct non. So, every area may mga in charge to prepare and discuss their PPTs. And every one is compliant naman despite the super busy sched we have the past few weeks. Those identified owners really put an effort in making their slides and sending it to me on time. Except sa supervisors namin.

What happened, yung unang sched namin (which is last week) ay pinamove nila (supervisors) kasi di pa sila nakakapag-update ng slides, and nagreason sila na imove namin pagbalik nung isa naming kawork (the one who usually conducts it) kasi last business review nya na with us dahil lilipat na ng ibang team. So I consider the request, and move the review today.

So today, I reminded the owners to update their slides para okay na lahat later sa review. And then yung supervisors namin nagdemand na naman sakin na imove ulit, and nagreason out na naman sila ng kung ano ano, well in fact di lang naman talaga nila naupdate yung slides nila. Kaya ako, pinilit ko talaga na wag mamove kasi nakakahiya naman sa mga nagpasa on time, kasi parang di nirerespeto yung time nila. What annoys me is sumagot pa yung isa and sinabi na ""Kaya naman yan ng quarterly!"" In which I replied, ""Bat pa natin ginawang monthly to kung quarterly pala gusto nyo."" And to be honest, mas kawawa yung owners na affected if quarterly ang gagawin kasi their reports are more crucial kesa dun sa hinihintay na report from those supervisors, and di madali magcollate ng data for 3 mos at gawan ng comparison yun.

Niraise ko sa manager namin na okay na lahat, yung slide nalang ng 2 supervisor and kulang, and yun nalang hinihintay. And yet, ang action ng boss ko is to cancel the meeting, kasi kung ano ano na din yung nireason out sa kanya nung 2. Wala na kong nagawa. Eh may invited kaming manager mula sa ibang team, and even her nagulat sya na nacancel yung review today, and yet ang reason ng Manager ko ""madami kasing training"". Gusto kong sabihin na ""wala po kasing slides pa until now yung mga supervisor namin"". Sobrang inis ko, di nalang ako kumibo na, nasira na yung mood ko.

Yung mga involve persons na magpepresent sana, nagsipag-rant sakin na bakit daw na-cancel, lagi nalang daw ganon kaya nasasanay yung 2 supervisor na di mag-update ng part nila kasi laging pinagbibigyan. I understand where they are coming and I symphatize with them. I tried to defend them, kaso wala eh. And now, I'm so mad kasi napaka-unfair talaga. 

Plus factor pa na ako yung tao na gusto naka-plan ng maayos yung mga bagay, and pag naset ko na yung utak ko dun sa plinano ko and biglang naiba or di natuloy, nahihirapan na ko magfunction effectively, kasi nasisira talaga mood ko.

148,Should I resign? ,"23(F) here, living in Metro Manila. I’m currently working in a hybrid set-up, low-stress, low-sahod (lol), and low-workload job. 7 months pa lang ako. Tbh, hindi naman toxic yung work, mabait mga workmates, and malapit lang din yung worksite sa house ko so 10-minute jeepney ride lang siya. Yun lang, mababa sahod (below 20k) and inaccept ko lang siya kasi first job ko siya. For experience lang sana.

We also have a carenderia na medyo matagal na (20+ years, yes older than me. Baby ‘yan ni mommy dati, mas mahal niya pa kesa sa akin charot) and that’s earning pretty well. Sales are averaging around 60-70k per month, net sales na. Our staff is trust-worthy, and they work well on their own. Hindi ko na need everyday bumisita sa pwesto, kasi nagkukusa na silang maghatid ng sales and inventory sa akin kasi alam nilang may work ako. I’d say we built a pretty good relationship with the staff as well.

Wala naman akong family na binubuhay— only my dad now, na pensionado na rin naman. He worked abroad his whole life too, kaya may savings siya for himself.

I’m thinking of resigning, kasi I don’t see the point, at least for now, of me working when may business naman. Pero naisip ko lang din yung possibility of the business going bankrupt (sana hindi naman) and everything else that might happen in the future. Plus yung HMO and benefits ko pa, sayang din.

Nasasayangan din ako kasi maluwag yung sa trabaho ko ngayon, I don’t think I’ll be able to find a job with a similar set-up in the future. But then again, yung sahod ko naman for a month is equivalent to just a week’s sale ng tindahan namin. So idk.

153,Time to Resign 🙌,"Time to Resign 🙌 (Repost ko nalang para don sa nag reklamo na dalawa) Haha

So currently I am working on a big company here in Ph (MM) . I am working with them for almost 1 year na this coming April. 

First, I work with them as a Graphic Artist pero Multimedia Artist yung JT ko. So Nag start
ako with them yr 2023. Nag final interview ako
with the RM and yung dating MA nila which sya magging immediate head ko. Onsite ako ni-last interview so nakita ko yung office maganda, maayos madaming employee. So shempre napa wow din ako and since final interview na yon next is yung offer and I accepted it na. Habang iniinterview ako numg RM and yung IH ko, mejo blinded ako that time na something wrong with my IH. Siguro sa sobrang overwhelmed ko na pumasok sa magandang company, mejo ok na sahod hndi ko napansin yon. I just ignored it, until my first day. 

On my first day shempre diretso ako sa HR non, pirma time ng contract, discussion ng benefits etc etc. So After that may pinasagutan sakin before ako pumunta sa area ko and yung IH ko sinundo ako. When she came, no “HI HOW are you!, Im ~~ and ako yung maggng head mo :)” But she just entered the room and sit and asked me “Tapos kana?” and since i am blinded sakania  na may something sakania inignore ko lang. So tapos nako mag sagot dun sa pinapasagutan  so nag sabi ako sa HR and submitted the paper. Yung IH ko nag ccp lang sya while I’m answering yung pinapasagutan nila. As in CP no talk, no conversation. Then she asked me again “Tapos kana?” and I said “Yes po”. So tumayo sya, tumayo na din ako and I remembered what she said “Ikaw na mag dala ng laptop mo, mabigat yan eh”. Like where’s the warm welcome there? Hahahah. Not saying na sya dapat mag dala kasi willing naman ako mejo nakaka OFF lang yung attitude. 

And the days past by nakikita ko na hindi nya ko gusto as her subordinate. So ayon hanggang sa 3rd, 4th month ko up to now nasanay na kami na mag uusap lamg pag may task nako. May time na buong 8Hrs hndi kami nag uusap, pag dating nya sa office uupo lang sya no kamustahan, no goodmorning. May times dati magchachat pa sya to the fact na magkatabi lang kami. Kaya simula non na ilang nako. May times din na naka earphones ako since working hours no talks talaga naka silent mode as in so shempr kinig nalang ako spotify ng mga podcast. Eh tinatawag nya pala ko or may need sya, for my opinion kasi MAGKATABI lang kami ano ba naman yung kalabitin or tap nya lang ako sa balikat dba or chat nalang ako sa viber kung may sasabhn sya well TINAP nya ng sobrang lakas yung table side ko which is nagulat ako and since open area kami mej napahiya ako ng beri beri layt. 

Then yun after non may scenarios naman na binabara nya ko like nung kausap ko yung isang ka office mate namin and then may tinanong ako dun sa kausap ko about someone na ka office mate din namin basta ang pagkakatanda ko ang tinatanong ko is may sinasabi yung ka office mate ko na may isang taga ibang dept na ka same ko ng lugar kung saan nauwi eh since bago pako tinanong ko yung ka officemate ko if may idea ba sya if saan sa *lugar namin* yung sinasabi nya taga ibang dept, and sa hindi inaasahang pang yayari sumabat yung IH sabay sabi *“Kahit naman sabihin namin sayo dimo rin kilala”* LIKE SHOOKT. 🫢 HHAHAHAHAHA 

After nyan ilang na talaga ako, tho may comm pa din kami pero work related nalang like pag may papagawa sya and about sa mga tasks ko like revisions etc. 

The main point is when I worked with my previous IH or “Mentors” sobrang dami kong takeaways from them and mron kaming personal bonds as in close ko. Never akong naintimidate, never akong kinabahan makipag usap as on sobrang smooth ng transactions and comm. but not this one. Feel ko pumapasok nalang ako do the tasks and sahod but not doing the tasks while learning and earning. Some jobs na unrelated sa designing pinagawa rin sakin which is isa sa tasks nya before yun. May times din na inutuusan ako before maglakad ng permit sa isang place i dunno if part pa yun ng JD ko, may times din na pinadala sa office, sya yung contact person may gnagawa ako and ako pinakuha tinanong ko if bayad na pero dipa daw so nagdala ako since ilang ako and trusted ko naman na babayaran nag wait nalang ako and since IH ko sya nahiya naman ako manigil.

Ayun so currently I’m starting to applying na pero still employed pa rin since may mga bayarin hehe. ",0,2,0.33,True,Story 🗣️,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/1br9ye1/time_to_resign/,2024-03-30 13:17:50,1br9ye1
154,Advice needed ,"Hi there, as the title suggest. I'm(25M) (Mechanical Engineer) thinking of leaving my company. My current job is a Data Center engineer in an IT company here in the South but my family is out north. After working here for a year and a half, I feel like I should quit in order to earn more money. I think there's a lot that I'm losing out on. Many reports here on reddit suggest that people switch jobs during this period of time and have a chunk of salary increase . Salary wise, this company compensates me more than 20k with 13th month pay and even a bonus that can give you a range of 2x-3x your current salary and also it increases every year around 10-12%. This company also gives Internal training but it comes with a price of bonds but the duration is very short. My Bond should finish this August but they're planning on making us get the ITIL exam this December. Why do I think of leaving this company, after all this benefits? here's why? feel like I can do more with my achievements right now. I just recently got my 2nd PRC license. this February. We also have Internal Training here and recently got an CDCP certificate last year. I'm planning on getting a CCNA Certificate this year. I'm super grateful for my Manager and the culture here, but we can't have it all. Can we? the Lead on our team can't even teach us about a thing or two. We just need to atleast figure it out on our own. No guidance and whatsoever. Whenever I ask a question, he would just shut me up and won't even answer. I can still remember when it was still my probation period . He would sometimes ask questions about the fundamentals and I couldn't answer the right question everytime, I mean it's been months since I last reviewed. He would say out loud are u really an engineer? feeling ko ang bobo ko dito sa part eh. Man that hurted alot and even now. I think this is one of my main reason I think I'm stagnating because I feel like I'm not learning well. I also think that even having all of this achievements acquired. I think that I will never be good enough. All of my co workers here are smart and have technical skills and have different backgrounds rather than me having zero experience prior coming here. I need your advice? 🥺

157,Torn between my current job and a new job opportunity ,"
Hi I’m 24F and I need some help and a different perspective on what I would tell my current employer, who I’m on probation right now, that I plan on leaving. Don’t get me wrong they’re a great company, it’s a small growing company, the work environment is good and I’m learning a lot everyday however the pay is low and the travel going there can take me from 2-3 hours depending on the traffic, since I’m from QC and my workplace is in Makati. The other company on the other hand is a big company and travel can take up to 1 hour and 30 mins only and the pay is bigger. This time though I would have a different role which I am interested in too. The problem is, the new company that wants to hire me wants me to start before my probation period ends in my current company and I clearly stated that I’ll only be available after the end of my probation with my current employer. I honestly wanna grab this opportunity with this new company because I don’t think any other company offers this type of role in Metro Manila or PH in general. But ayun I think they kind of disrespected my expected starting date. I emailed them about it na and they gave me a new starting date which is still before my expected starting date. So I’m really torn on what I should do :(

159,Pagod na akong mag-benta ng product na wala pa namang bumibili,"Gusto ko lang mag-release ng saloobin ko at manghingi ng advice dito. Medyo mahaba to, so maraming salamat sa mga makikinig sakin dito.

Background ko is, fresh graduate, with no prior experience to sales and business to business relation.

And right now, I'm handling a product for a year already with ZERO Sales. I am the second person to handle this product, and ever since this product was acquired by our company, it has never got any closed deal or income for the company.

Imagine? Ganon na katagal.

And to give you more insight sa sitwasyon ko, hindi rin siya yung type ng product na super necessity sa isang industry. It was just an upgrade for an existing market.

Sobrang nappressure na ko, since some of the consumables of the equipment I'm selling will be soon expiring in the middle of this year, pati na rin yung license to sell it dito sa Pinas.

Don't get me wrong, marami na kong ginawa sa part ko para mebenta to:

-joining tradeshows/exhibits

-cold calling (lead generation)

-offering it with zero down payment, with 12 months installment package

-tinanong ko na rin ang boss ko kung pupwede ba na directly akong magpunta sa companies so I can meet my clients personally, since when i pitch the lead to our salespeople who have a car, they don't prioritize it kasi nga alam nila na wala pang nabebentang ganito, and hindi siya super necessity.

Kaso my boss didn't allowed me to do so since I don't have a car yet, and for me to establish a relationship, he said I need to visit them constantly, therefore it would mean that I would commute alone to every entity that I have a lead, which is very tiring and costly on my part

-nagawa ko na rin mag conduct ng effective and strategic product presentations and demos, na may comparative slides with clients current set up using other alternatives, and how they're better when they acquire our machine.

Yet after presenting it to the client, the usual  responses would be:

\\- Hindi pa namin siya priority

\\- ""we actually don't need it, since we are currently using this ""alternative"".

\\- Wala pa kaming budget diyan, may iba pa kaming priority

\\- maybe we will try to pitch it to our bosses next year for purchase

\\- our business would still function without your equipment on it, therefore it isn't really a necessity.

\\- And some would also think that ""I am just selling a useless product"".

Sobrang degrading sa pakiramdam bilang isang professional na habang nagppresent ako sa clients, makikita ko na pinagtatawanan ako ng mga customers ko, nagbubulungan, mostly sinasabi is ""hindi naman gaano ka-essential yung product niya"".

Ang sakit honestly. Na ginawa ko lahat ng makakaya ko para aralin yung machine at galingan during product presentation, tapos pagbubulungan lang at pagtatawanan habang nagpproduct presentation. Iniisip ko baka may mali na ko habang nagppresent.

Alam niyo yung tingin ng audience na, ""sinusubukan lang ako nito bentahan ng hindi pa naman ganun ka importanteng makina.""

Also, my target market were so busy, and they medyo mahirap din sila makausap kasi nasa restricted area sila.

May mga inaabutan din ang salespeople namin ng brochure ng product na handle ko, and then binabalik lang sa kanila, sinasabi na, hindi naman namin to kailangan. :(

To be honest, I feel so frustrated and hopeless about it. It feels like I am pouring in a broken cup. Nauubos lang lahat ng pagod at effort ko para sa wala.

This is my first experience of working in this industry, and at hindi ko na alam ang gagawin ko sa product ko na hindi maibenta-benta.

Konti na lang, magreresign na ko sa sobrang pressure ko. At sobrang sakit sa dibdib. May mga pagkakataon pa na after presentation, gusto ko na umiyak kasi pakiramdam ko, hindi sila ganun ka-interesado sa pinepresent ko.

Alam niyo yung pakiramdam na excited ka mag-kwento tapos yung kausap mo, tinatawanan ka lang, and seems uninterested? Ganon. Ang hirap, tang-ina. How I wish nasa fast moving goods ako naka-assign.

Ang sakit din na tuwing nakikita kami ng boss ko or nakakasama ako during meeting with sales, lagi niya nabbring up na ""failure"" ako pagdating sa pagbebenta nitong product na to.

Hiyang-hiya na rin ako sa colleagues at lalo na sa boss ko. Kasi yung zero sales na to, it reflects who I am eh. I take full responsibility of the situation naman, to the point na pakiramdam ko minsan parang wala na kong ginagawang tama.

Pagod na ko sa paulit ulit na makakakuha ng lead, kokontakin, magseset ng schedule, magppresent, then tatawanan lang habang nagppresent/pagbubulungan lang ako, tapos after presentation sasabihin, ""ay sorry di pa kasi namin siya priority ngayon"".

Iniisip ko baka kulang lang ako sa strategy or proper sales training and handling negotiation. Pati kung paano mag add ng urgency sa presentation.

Gustuhin ko man mag-resign, ayoko naman mag-mukhang failure na iwanan na lang ang boss ko at ang company na wala man lang silang napala sa lahat ng ininvest nilang training at pasahod sakin. Kaya hanggat kaya ko pa, gagawa ako ng paraan para lang maka-close kahit isang deal nito. Ipit na ipit ako sa nararamdaman ko sa totoo lang.

Pagod na ko pero ayoko sukuan kasi nakakahiya naman sakanila at ayoko rin umalis na failure sa company, dahil hindi naman ako quitter.

Sobrang nahihirapan ako mag-benta. Kaya sana maging mabait naman kayo sa mga tinatawag niyong ""ahente lang"". Pinag-aaralan, pinagpupuyatan, at pinagpapaguran po namin tong mga product na pinepresent namin. May mga pamilya rin po kaming binubuhay kaya sana irespeto niyo kami kapag nagppresent.

Hindi po lahat ng ahente, gusto lang makabenta tapos iiwan na kayo sa ere pag after sales na. Yung iba, willing talaga kayong tulungan sa current problem niyo at ready to assist hanggang after sales.

Salamat kung umabot kayo dito. Gusto lang mag-release ng frustrations ko sa work ko. Kasi di ko na talaga alam kung sinong pagsasabihan ko nito. Ipit na ko sa pressure ng boss ko, at pressure na wala pang nabebenta.



And if may ma-aadvice kayo sa sitwasyon ko, salamat rin, sobrang maaappreciate ko talaga. :(

170,I AM A MEAT VENDOR IN DIVISORIA AND MY EMPLOYEE(BUTCHER) FILED A COMPLAINT TO DOLE AND NLRC,"Baka pwede pong humingi ng tulong.

Ang scenario po ay..

* Siya po ay butcher na kasama sa pagtitinda, pero yung mga gamit po namin panglatag sa Divisoria tulad ng gantyo, timbangan atbp ay nakalagay po noon sa tricycle na dinadrive din niya papunta sa puwesto o yung workplace nila sa night market. Pero para gumaan din yung trabaho nila, bumili po kami ng multicab para mayroon silang sasakyan na dadalhin sa Divisoria at para doon na lang nakalagay lahat ng gamit kapag tapos magtinda at hindi na ipapasok pa sa bahay.
* Nagulat po kami ng biglang nagreklamo siya sa Bitag na hindi raw namin siya pinapasahod ng 3 years na sa pagdadrive dahil noong 2020 raw ay bukod daw ang sahod sa pagdadrive niya at pagiging butcher niya. Hindi po namin alam na may problema pala sa kaniya ang pagdadrive at nalaman lang po namin yan nung tumawag yung staff ng Bitag.
* 700 pesos a day ang sahod po niya. Nakukuha niya po ito pagkatapos namin magtinda araw-araw. 10:30 pm hanggang 4:00 am ang paglatag sa Divisoria pero mga 7:00 am na sila natatapos. Ang sahod niya po ay walang kaltas sa SSS, Philhealth, at Pag-IBIG. Wala po kaming company ID dahil small business lang. Walang payslip; pagtapos magtinda receive agad ng pera.
* After tumawag ng Bitag, ilang days palang ay nagpaere siya at sinabi niya yung reklamo niya sa pagdadrive. Without my consent, inere nila yung picture ko at yung picture ng meatshop namin sa baba ng bahay namin (na hindi naman niya pinagtatrabahuhan dahil sa Divisoria na pwesto namin siya nagtatrabaho). Ang permit po namin sa Divisoria ay nakapangalan sa kapatid ko dahil siya na po ang nagmamanage doon at ako po ang nagfifinance. Sa meatshop naman po namin sa baba ng bahay ay asawa ko po ang owner.
* Nirefer po siya sa DOLE tas nagpadala ng notice of conference. Nakaaddress po sa meatshop namin sa bahay ang letter, at nakalagay doon na iniimbita ay management ng meatshop namin. Dumalo kami at ang nakalagay po na reklamo ay walang 13th month pay, walang Service Incentive Leave, at wala raw pong benefits. Naset aside yung initial niyang reklamo na dapat naming bayaran siya sa pagdadrive ng bukod, dahil ang narereceive niya raw dati ay meron pang additional na 500 pesos sa pagdadrive. Ang niraise niya rin pong concern is ginigipit din siya sa pagbabale, na ayon sa batas hindi naman namin pala obligasyon.
* After ng paguusap, inaask niya kami ng 150,000 for settlement. Nagoffer kami ng 70,000 tas kakaltasan ng 20,000 (balance niya sa pagbabale) bale malinis na 50,000 ang makukuha niya. Humingi po kami ng tulong sa abogado, sa totoo lang daw po generous amount na ang 50,000 para sa ganitong case. Ang bigat po ng 150,000 para sa amin dahil vendor lang naman po kami. Ayaw niya po pumayag dahil gusto niya 150k at nirefer na po kami sa NLRC.
* Klaro po samin na gusto niya ng pera, dahil ganyan po ang ginawa ng kapatid niya sa company nila at nakareceive ng 200,000. Ma'am/Sir, hindi po kami kumpanya..vendor lang po kami.

Questions:

1. Paano po ba namin siya pagbabayarin sa ginawa niyang kahihiyan sa amin through media kung saan wala naman pong katotohanan ang mga sinabi niya?
2. Posible bang madismiss ang complaint/case na ifafile niya sa NLRC? Ano po ba ang basis nila sa pagaaccept ng mga reklamo?
3. Ano pong masasabi niyo 150,000 na asking amount niya for settlement? (Ang hirap lang po kasi parang naeextort kami kasi uuwi pala siya ng probinsiya pagkatapos makareceive ng pera at gusto raw nila magsimula doon)
4. Magkano po kaya ang aabutin na babayaran ko sa kasong ito?
5. Paano po namin mapapatunayan na sa Divisoria siya nagtatrabaho at hindi sa meatshop namin? Kapag po ba parehas ng owner pupuwede pong iaddress niya sa meatshop ang reklamo? (Katwiran niya, sa meatshop daw namin nanggagaling ang baboy)
6. Gaano po katagal namin marereceive ang summon from NLRC?

Mag-hire? No. Make them work kahit weekend or holiday. Management doesn’t care. Natatakot ako na baka ako mismo, ma-corrupt. I just can’t anymore.

176,No overtime pay?,"My girlfriend is currently working as a junior accountant in a certain company in Taguig and has been for more than a year. And ever since working in this company, she has been constantly working overtime even during the weekends and holidays which is really concerning to me because she only gets 3-4 hours of sleep everyday. I asked if she at least gets paid well for her overtime but to my surprise she told me she wasn’t paid at all for her overtime ever since she started working for the compant. It upsets me that she pushes her body to the limit that she frequently gets sick because of the toxic work environment that she has been dealing with for the past year. She also mentioned about the high resignation rates and job positions that are constantly open in her company which is automatically a red flag. 

When I searched about the overtime pay in the Philippines, according to Article 87 of the Labor Code: any employee shall be paid for overtime work at a rate not less than their regular wage plus at least 25%. For work done beyond eight hours on holidays and rest days, the rate is even higher—no less than the regular wage plus at least 30%. 

But it also stated that there are exceptions to this like managerial employees and certain types of field personnel which could be a loophole the company could be using. Are junior accountants not eligible for overtime pay?

Tldr: my girlfriend does not receive overtime pay.

Im currently routing my clearance with my previous organization, and my boss wont sign my clearance due to ""missing"" files with my handover.

I ended with them last March, and had a meeting with another colleague for my handover documents. I wasn't made aware of any missing files when I had my handover meeting (which was a week before and then on my last 2 days as well). I did also reach out to my manager a week before my end date for the handover but she never responded to my messages. 

When I first routed my clearance, she noted that I should return the laptop ASAP and they will be checking my handover files. 

I returned the assets a week after my end date, but I was not flagged with any missing files or documents when I dropped by the office. 

I got her on cc on every email for the handover, and as requested by my colleague, I uploaded the files needed via our sharepoint as well and made an email about every task I had and the tasks that they need to do or continue.

There is also recording of the handover meeting as requested by my colleague so that she can back track everything.

When I dropped by the office to return the assets, to my surprise there were questions being asked to me by my colleague which was already discussed thoroughly during our handover meeting and it was also included in the email. 

Now I put my boss as my reference, since she is my line manager however the organization withdrew their job offer after receiving the reference letter from my former manager.

184,Lagi ba dapat OT,"Just wanna share my situation and need advice na rin.

I'm a former intern sa accounting firm na pinapasukan ko. Bale, naka 4 months din ako sa kanila. May allowance naman, 100 a day goods na rin kasi malapit lang. Madalas maraming ginagawa, minsan naman maraming vacant na oras.

Ngayon, na absorb ako sa firm. Kinausap ako ng boss ko if pwede daw ba ako mag work sa kanila after ojt ko. Pumayag ako for 2 months lang. 300 per day (9am-6pm). 1 tricycle lang mula sa'min kaya okay na rin. 

Pumayag ako dahil natapos na OJT ko, tengga na ako sa bahay at waiting na lang sa graduation kaya sayang naman if wala akong gagawin sa ilang buwan.

During my internship days, di na bago sa'kin yung mag OT sila madalas dahil marami talagang ginagawa. As an OJT noon, minsan din ako nag O-OT. 

Ngayong magwowork na ako sa kanila as employee, required bang mag OT din ako katulad ng ginagawa nila? Sa isip ko, parang nahihiya ako if di ko sila sabayan. If uuwi ako kagad ng 6pm. Pero kasi nakakapagod din e. Di naman bayad OT ko. 300 per day lang. Parang gini-guilt trip ako ng mga ka workmate ko bakit daw hindi ako mag O-OT. Okay naman mag OT pag maraming due kinabukasan, eh sa ngayon wala naman. Natatapos ko naman yung pinapagawa within the day. Hay. Hirap naman magOT kung makikipagdaldalan lang sakanila.

Pero since good company nga, ang hirap makapasok. Grabe hiring process nila sobrang higpit, paper screening palang pwede ka na maligwak. 

My previous boss in Company B had the chance to get in Company A. 

I grabbed the opportunity to reach out if may vacancy sa team niya from a Product/Program role (which is my background for 4 1/2 years now). Luckily, meron daw so I submitted my resume and started the interview process. 

Again, swerte. I got JO not just with Company A but with another option, Company C. 

Weighted pros and cons, Company A won. 

I signed.... Happy ending? WRONG. 

i felt that my teammates are very secretive with the Program I'll be handling, I kept asking for a proper turnover but they kept sharing very high level information and ako pa nakipagkilala sa mga stakeholders for a walkthrough of what they do for the program I'm hired to handle. 

The reason behind the secretive tactic pala is yung MVP (Fresh grad na may opportunity to go to multiple units) decided to stay sa unit namin and handle my Program. 

Okay lang naman sakin pero nawalan ako ng trabaho, I became redundant. 

I raised this as a concern but the resolution was to give a role of Sales, which is not my background at all. however, may person in charge nadin for Sales. 

I was tasked to assist my existing teammates on their tasks. 

I became an assistant. (I'm of rank, currently, manager rank) so ang hirap tanggapin. 

Gathered the strength to tell HR.

194,Thank GOD I left this company.,"First of all, I am glad that I already have been told by my superiors to leave the company because I have reached the point where I am feeling overworked and burnt out (and already telling them that I need my workload to be distributed to my colleagues), hence underperforming and not meeting the KPIs. I am just sooooo glad that I wouldn't have to deal with such a shitty company that only cares about profit above all else. Even though I am already rendering my last days in my current company, I still cannot fathom how only a select few people in my team would dare speak up about the injustices of the company, namely the following, as I want to take this off of my chest:

&#x200B;

* Micromanagement in the workplace (maraming talagang epal na seniors na are watching over every single move of their subordinates)
* Messaging of colleagues/seniors/CEO after work hours via Messenger (the latest message I received by which I needed my attention was at 1 am) -- TALK ABOUT HAVING NO BOUNDARIES HUH!
* Lying by omission (management mentioned that we will be receiving performance bonuses last year, but until now wala pa rin + many of my teammates have asked follow-ups but we didn't hear jackshit)
* Favoritism (CEO cherrypicks the best performers and shames the underperforming + roasts people for their mistakes over and over again until it gets dehumanizing)
* Blatant ignorance and rejection of feedback to the management raised by teams in terms of bettering workplace conditions
* Little-to-no potential for career growth
* Understaffed

&#x200B;

To top it all off, they always promise to rectify and to improve the working conditions given our grievances, but until now, not one single mention of reform would even happen.

As per the Admin Supervisor po, hinold niya raw kasi may nakita daw po siyang mga pending receipt na wala pang bayad sa Shopee & Lazada orders during my time sa company. And I understand that lalo na't may mali rin ako sa part ko since hindi ko naayos ang mga payout before ako umalis. Maiintindihan ko rin kung ibabawas sa last pay ko ang lahat.

Pero bago niya ako ihold sa clearance, nasabi po sakin ng hr department na clear na po ako sa audit department at hindi daw po nila alam bakit ako hinold ng admin sa dati kong work.

2,Maglalabas lang ng sama ng loob dahil sa nangyari sa akin dati,"Lumipat ako ng company na pinagtratrabahuhan (from this kilalang IT company to a multi-national oil company). Ang rason ko para lumipat ay dahil sa laki ng sweldo na inooffer.

Pero nagkamali ako ng desisyon.

Sabi nila, dun sa company na yun, may work-life balance. Mababait ang tao. Naloko nila ako.

I was bullied at work. May mga “alpha females” dun na pinaparinggan ako, kesyo “wala daw akong magiging kakampi”, “alam namin rate mo”, etc. (pasigaw yan ah). As in kinakawawa ako. Pati mga kasamahan ko na lalaki, nakikisali sila dun. Tahimik na nga lang ako dun, dami pang ginawa sa akin na masama.

After a few months na nagstay ako sa company na yun, di ako makatulog ng maayos. Kada darating ang Sabado, dun pa lang ako nagiging maligaya. Kapag darating na ang weekdays, parang hinahatak ko sarili ko sa kama. Dumating sa punto na parang susukuan ko na yung buhay ko, tipong magpakamatay.

December ng 2016, nagpacheck-up ako sa psychiatrist. I was diagnosed with clinical depression and anxiety.

Lahat ng kaibigan ko ng college, iniwan ako. O mas pinili ko na din na iwan ko sila kasi iniwan nila ako nung kailangan ko sila. Nung babang-baba na ako sa sarili ko, mas pinili nila na di ako pansin para maging “mature” daw ako at harapin ko daw yung masamang nangyayari sa akin. Ganun na pala definition ng mga kaibigan ngayon? Iwan-iwan? Haha!

Nagresign ako sa company na yun at sinabi ko na nagkadepression ako dito. Sabi ba naman ng pinaka-boss namin dun, “Mababait naman yang mga kasama mo tsaka yang sila K####a, sadyang strong women lang sila. Tsaka yang depression mo, di naman dahil siguro sa company yan. Baka dati pa yan…”

Ede wow, pagtanggol mo pa. Gaslight pa more! Strong pla yung kapag wala kayo at nakatalikod kayo, nambubully ng kasamahan porket bago? Lol

Nagresign ako agad agad, walang ipon. Walang lilipatan. Nakatambay lang ako sa bahay ng 2017.
Feeing ko talo ako nun. Pabigat. Lalo na yung meds ko para sa depression at anxiety, inaasa ko nun sa nanay ko. Nahihiya ako.

After a month or two nung nagresign ako, yung company na yun nagkaroon ng campaign about mental health. Kita ko sa LinkedIn at FB Page nila. HUWAW? Apply-apply din natin sa real life yung mga ganyan ano? Manong alisin nyo yung mga culprits ng mental health issues dyan? Haha!

Ngayon, happy ako at thankful kay Lord kasi binigyan nya ako ng magandang trabaho, mababait na mga kasama, at company na inuuna ang work-life balance at mental health. Naisip ko na baka pinagdaanan ko yun dahil si Lord tutulungan din ako!

Lesson learned sa akin at sana matutunan natin lahat:

1. Huwag papasilaw agad sa laki ng salary na inooffer ng kabila kung naghahadali sila maghanap ng employee. Always ask the HR bakit open ang position;

2. Ask kung mataas ang attrition rate nung team na papasukan mo dapat. Lagi nyong tatanungin sa interview bakit nabakante yung posisyon na yun. Yung kaso nung akin may umalis din pala na same position ko, at one month pa lang sya. (Jusq HR, di pa ba kayo nakakahalata ng problema sa existing na tao ng team na yun?);

3. Okay lang na mag-burn ng bridges sa mga kaibigan lalo na kung di sila maganda sa mental health mo at ang gusto lang nila at “happy-happy” lang, kahit kasing tagal pa as college classmates at mas matagal pa 😊

4. At ang huli: Mas importante ang mental health mo kesa sa kahit anong trabaho. Kung di mapakawalan ang toxic na trabaho agad agad para sa pamilya o para sa pera, magtiis muna then gumawa ng game plan para makaalis sa mga p_nyet~ na yan. Pero remember MENTAL HEALTH is also WEALTH! Wala tayong paggagamitan ng pera kung patay na o nagbabalak na magpakamatay. 2024 na, open na lahat about sa Mental Health. Kung meron di pa, we can educate them. Kapag naooverwhelm ka na at kailangan mo ng kausap, go to the Philippines Mental Health Association Facebook page. May makakausap ka dun.

Tulungan tayo. Kaya natin to.",34,5,1.0,True,Story 🗣️,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/1bvoupy/maglalabas_lang_ng_sama_ng_loob_dahil_sa_nangyari/,2024-04-04 22:40:09,1bvoupy
3,DOLE ZOOM MEET 2 vs 1??? ,"Hi! need your opinions about the situation kanina nung zoom meeting. so nagulat ako etong nireport ko ngang company ko ang nilagay na person to contact is yung HR since sya lang naman ang need ko makasagot ng mga tanong ko since yung huling email nya sakin na makipag coordinate sa accounting is hindi naman nag reresponse sakin. 

Ang issue namin is 107 days na nakalipas pero wala pa ring last pay and ang sabi is hindi pa ko cleared sa accounting. Gulat din ako na malaki ang idededuct nila. Nakipag coordinate na ko halos sa lahat pero nakakasawa mag follow up at dama mong gusto nila ideduct yung short na yon kasi nga last year pa yon and hindi na talaga sya mahahanap. Napakatagal nila mag reply kaya nireport ko na sila sa DOLE dahil ang concern ko is yung idededuct sa sahod ko na walang pasabi or any agreements. Nagulat ako kanina dalawa sila na nasa zoom meeting. Yung HR at head ko. Okay lang ba na dalawa sila don? kasi ang nangyari kanina mas nagingibabaw sila kasi dalawa at malakas masyado boses na kala mo talaga may kalaban sila. Pwede bang may kasama yung HR kahit na dapat sya lang yung kausapin ko? Imbis kasi na napakinggan both, parang mas napunta sa side nila kasi ako raw ang hindi nakikipag coordinate sa kanila pero ilang follow up na ginagawa ko sa email hahahaha. Ang nangyari is nagkaroon back up ang HR hahahaha. Sabi pa na nakailang beses na tawag daw sila di ako nakikipag coordinate e sinasabi ko nga sa kanila na hindi ako makakasagot calls kasi busy at kaya ko lang ibigay yung email tapos galit pa sila? Nagsabi pa na nagdedemand daw ako na wag ako kaltasan. Di ako nag dedemand. Hindi lang ako sang ayon sa ginagawa nila.

6,As an HR some HRs don't understand interview is a two way road. ,"So, I got invited for an interview today.  Sabi sakin 9AM ako pumunta, I did. Napakalayo ng nilakad since walang public transpo na malapit sa building at sobrang init but it's okay since the offer they posted on Indeed ay mataas naman. I went there hoping na ""ito na nga"". Pagdating ko ng office the receptionist smiled at me, mabait naman. Kaya sabi ko parang ang ganda environment.. until lumabas yung interviewer. She greeted me naman. I was looking at her lang then napansin ko tinitignan niya ako mula ulo hanggang paa. You know those weird gaze. I ignored nalang baka OA lang ako. Then after exam we had an interview. 

First thing pagpasok namin sa interview room nila, she started talking about how I look. Asked me bakit hindi daw ako nakaayos. I asked her what does she meant sa nakaayos, sabi lang niya you know yung mas kapalan mo ba yung make up. Yung pumuputok yung blush on, thick red lipstick, and so on. Sabay sabi niya ""Hope you're not offended"", i still didn't mind it. We then proceeded sa interview, she asked few things, kung ano na mismo nakalagay sa resume ko reason for leaving. She didn't ask ano ba yung tasks ko or any other technicalities. Hindi maayos yung mga questions niya and disorganized. She then told me napunta siya sa HR recruitment couple months ago, that she wasn't part of HR before. She had a different role in the same company before which is far from being HR. I wanted to say na ""I can tell"".. I didn't wanna sound rude so I stayed quiet. She said na among HRs siya yung pinaka ""bully"" daw. Mahilig siya manita and so on and fort. Once she's done talking about her story, she continued talking about my appearance. It really become even more uncomfortable for me. Bago pa ako lumabas ng interview room, sinita pa niya suot ko why I'm wearing ""smart casual"" when she clearly told me when we had a phone call na smart casual nalang. Dapat daw I should be ""presentable"", yung suot ko daw is blazer, tight slack, closed heels, and visible accessories.. in short full corpo, mala CEO ata ang peg. I just said goodbye but uhhh I got annoyed. I know I have 80% chance of getting the offer however the vibe of the interview makes me don't wanna work there.

10,IQ-EQ na walang EQ,"Long story ahead.

This is one of the most unforgettable experience I've had sa isang company sa Pasig na IQ-EQ nung 2019.

After working in Accenture for 2 years, I stopped working for a year because of depression and then once I was ready to work again, I applied for this company.

I applied for a Senior Accountant role, but I told them during the phone interview that as long as the pay is good, I am very much willing to accept other roles na accounting related and kahit hindi senior level.

I was invited for a face-to-face interview and assessment na may english language assessment, accounting assesment, and last yung excel assessment.

I arrived on time. I waited for almost an hour because I was told that the interviewer didn't arrive yet.

When she arrived, we immediately started the english assessment which is naperfect ko since sanay nako sa ganung klaseng exams since madame na ako naapplyan noon pero sa computer to ginawa. Then next is the accounting exam which is Literally the EASIEST EXAM na natake ko sa pagaapply ko, because it was just a basic accounting exam and magtrial balance ka lang then adjusting entries. 

I was told nung start ng exam, na depende sa score ko kung anong makukuha ko if assistant accountant, accountant, intermediate accountant or senior accountant.

Before the exam started, i asked if may extra pen si interviewer since i noticed na yung binili ko is defective and i showed her. Nung nasa exam room na ako binigay niya saken padabog yung pen and paper then pabagsak ng pinto paglabas. I just let it pass. Nung phone interview naman kasi she was really nice. Baka pagod lang. Haha.

Then sure akong perfect yung exam kasi super dali. I waited for an hour before lumabas result and sinabay iannounce sa interview kung anong score ko. I was so disappointed when the interviewer told me that ""i barely passed the exam"" in a rude tone, and i told her if i could see how the exam was checked if possible, since i told her nicely na i believe the exam was very simple and nagtututor ako ng basic accounting sa ex ko and sa juniors noon sa college. Haha. Ayaw niya. Gusto ko lang alamin san ako nagkamali..HAHA

She mentioned na yung score ko is pang assistant accountant lang which is pinaka mababang role and yung salary was super lowballed. If ever daw ang offer lang is 18k wherein nung umalis ako sa ACN nasa 21k na ako after promotion to CL12 and salary increase.  I was shocked. But we continued the interview and she asked me a lot of very rude questions like ""bakit ka umalis sa previous work mo? May ginawa ka bang hindi maganda sa work mo at kaya ka umalis and kaya ka nagstop magwork ng 1 year?, ""why didn't you bring an extra pen for emergency cases? what if i hindi kita pinahiram edi bagsak ka na?"", ""are you willing to work overtime? Kasi di pwede samen yung onda palagi and dapat laging on time pumasok"".

I was like, hello? Sino kaya late sating dalawa ng 1 hr? Madame pa pero i forgot na yung iba. Tapos bes padabog siya gumalaw. Malapit na sana ako mag snap at lumabas init ng ulo ko buti nalang natapos na interview. She said that I passed the interview and next is excel assessment and final interview.

I was told after that na if i'm willing to continue, balik ako ng after lunch for the excel exam. 4 hrs na akong nasa kanila tapos babalik pa ako ulit. I told her na babalik ako pero as soon as I went out of the building, tinext ko yung number ng interviewer na sobrang rude niya and unprofessional and I was really uncomfortable during the entire interview and exam sa padabog dabog niya and etc na I almost snapped sa galit sa kanya. Sinabe ko na di na ako babalik and sana wag nila gawin yung ginawa niya saken sa future applicants nila kasi ang pangit talaga ng experience ko sa kanya. I went there full of hope na finally mukhang nakakita na ako ng maayos na company ulet then biglang disaster pala. Haha  Sayang mukhang magandang company pa naman. Haha. 🤣 Binlock ko din number niya before she could even respond and para akong nabunutan ng tinik after that. Haha.

14,HR insulted me because I withdrew my application,"So kahapon, nag-message ako sa HR ng company na inapplyan ko. Tinanong ko kung anong schedule ng work hours nila para sana magamay ko ang oras ng commute ko, kasi expected ko is standard 9 by 5 ang schedule per week. Then nalaman ko na 8am-6pm pala. Personally, di ko kaya, knowing na 2 hours pa ang icocommute ko papunta, pag pauwi depende pa since yung area is prone to traffic talaga. Wala ng matitira sa oras ko and I'm trying to be practical lang din, lalo pa hindi naman din ganon kataas ang offer. So nagmessage ako ulit kay HR, kahit sa text I made sure na nakuha nya yung tone ng text ko, formal, and hoping they would emphatize. Na-meet ko na sila since nakapag-interview na rin naman kami face to face, and nag-effort sila. Naappreciate ko yun despite the fact na iwiwthdraw ko application ko. But then, after a few minutes, nagreply si HR ng ganyan. First thing that came into my mind was, ""nang-iinsulto ba 'to?"" Is it that bad? That I can't waste my time working too much and not have a life outside my work? Mali ba na winithdrew ko yung application? Kahit sabihin mong nasayang yung oras nila, both parties have their lessons learned, pero tong kausap ko parang di nagtanda e. Mind you, sa HR pa yan, sobrang nagulat ako kasi I've worked with HR before, I've encountered HRs before, pero they all dealt it professionally. So bakit di nya magawa? Very unprofessional.

18,"Nalaman ng boss ko na nag-aapply na ako ng ibang trabaho, 3 months left na lang natitira sa project-based contract ko","I have 3 months left in my three year contract as an NGO worker in Cebu. My boss has hinted at a renewal but I'm not holding out hope as I'm in a precarious field (literally nagtatrabaho sa mga laylayan ng lipunan). I love my team, but work is work.

I started applying to more senior positions two months ago. I heard back from hiring managers too quickly, had interviews thru Zoom/Google meet, pero patago. The start dates weren't lining up with my current project end dates. I absolutely need a secure job, but I have huge projects and tasks coming up na parang pagsisisihan ko kung mag-reresign ako agad.

Tapos eto pa, may isang employer na inaplayan ko na nag-email sa boss ko the next day I applied in Jobstreet dahil character reference ko sya sa resume ko. Ayun sinermonan ako sa company email ko at thru PM sa FB. Inadvise ako na pwede ako mag-apply kahit kelan pero huwag ako magreresign hanggat hindi pa tapos contract ko by July. Ngayon natatakot na ako mag-excuse o mag-leave sa work baka pagdudahan ako na mag-iinterview sa ibang kumpanya.

With a contract end date in sight, when do you usually begin applying? I wasn't expecting to hear back from hiring managers for 3-4 months, and the interview process usually takes another month, but now I'm unsure.

21,my father's employer is not paying their SSS,"so bale this happens because yung ibang empleyado daw ay hindi na pumapasok so nasasama daw yun ng employer sa mga binabayara sa SSS kaya 7 months nang walang hulog sa SSS ang tatay ko. this is bullshit.

and what's more bullshit ay naaksidente ang tatay ko 2 years ago within his work's premise (car accident) tapos wala pa rin kaming nakukuhang temporary disability benefits sa SSS kasi hindi inaasikaso ng employer.

so my questions are:

1. gusto ko sana magcomplain in behalf ng tatay ko kasi ayaw rin nya kasi takot nga syang maalis sa work kahit kakarampot lang pinapasahod sa kanila. so saan pwede magcomplain ng non payment ng sss benefits by staying anonymous? kasi nung naggoogle ako, need daw magfile onsite. 


2. is it possible na makuha pa ng tatay ko ang benefits nya kahit it's almost 2 years late? sayang naman kasi yon. possible na arpund 80k up makukuha nya kasi naputol talaga yung buto nya sa car accident.

25,Homeaglow Company,"This is not just a company alert but also a #rant.

Anyway, so I applied to this company called Homeaglow  or Cozy Maid (they also go by Dazzling Company). 

First interview - Thursday at 12am
- smooth naman yung process, mabait yung recruiter na lalake pero may something off dun sa girl. I was asked magkano ang last drawn salary ko and if tatanggapi ko daw yung $$$ na pay. Sabi ko yes. Tapos sabi ni girl, “we know how recruitment works so lets be honest and tell us if you will really accept”, i said yes I will but in my mind, “wtf! seriously? You’re asking me that considering na recruitment lead ka?” So unprofessional. 

But thankfully, nakapasa sa first. 

Second interview - Saturday at 4am. Pero na-cancel and namove the following week, Saturday at 2am. Pero na-cancel ulit and namove ng 3am. Antok na antok na ako pero laban lang kasi andun na ako eh at gising pa eh. 

3am - entered the virtual meeting room 
3:15am - wala pa si interviewer so nagemail ako and told them Im na and waiting for host to accept 
3:35am - no reply so nagemail back ako kasi my gad 3:35am na wala pa! 
3:45am - i left the call kasi walang reply, walang email whatsoever. Alam nila I work day shift and I stayed up until 3:45am waiting for them. 

3:49am - nagemail yung interviewer and sinabi na available na daw sya and nasa call na.


Retards!!! Hindi man lang nagsorry si interviewer and yung recruiter for the inconvenience na ginawa nila. As in wala talaga. 

Pero eto ang company alert - they are scamming their customers pala sa US. Search nyo homeaglow sa google, ang daming negative reviews. Tapos ang owners may case sa isang state sa US so lumipat sila sa ibang state to avoid. Hahaha

26,"HR field, 6 days a week, long distance","I really need some advice pls. I feel stuck right now.

I’ve been working in medical field for almost 3 years na rin, super chill and comfortable, happy with workmates but it’s not fulfilling and no growth. So nag hahanap na rin ako ng new role these past few months, role na aligned sa degree ko (BS Psych), but kung hindi ko dini-decline yung interview, dini-decline ko naman yung job offers. I kinda felt bad kasi parang ang dami kong nami-miss na opportunity.

Then yesterday, ang pinili ko na lang ay yung offer sakin sa ortigas, pasig as a HR recruitment. I’ve always wanted that role kasi. Nung una, nag pass ako kasi 18k lang yung offer, and then tinaasan nila ng 20k because nalaman nila sa friend ko na plan ko sanang kunin yung offer na 19k sakin from another company which is along Caloocan lang, but hindi ko rin pinursue iyon.

Now, undecided pa rin me kung itutuloy ko ba yung sa Ortigas for the following reasons:

Cons:
1. Super long distance, 2 hrs away from Valenzuela. 4hrs away balikan. Maraming sasakyan and mahabang lakaran. (Ortigas pasig-Valenzuela) so, if aalis ako ng 6am makakarating ako ng 8am, uuwi ng 5pm makakuwi ng 7-8pm dipende pa sa traffic.
2. 6 days a week duty. + Less time with my pet and loved ones and I really value my time with them. 
3. No work-life balance

Pros:
1. Annually salary increase
2. Quarterly and Christmas bonuses
3. Increase salary once good ang performance
4. I think im going to like working with them due to age level.
5. Work experience in HR field since itong career talaga gusto kong kunin.

Anyhow, masaya pa naman ako sa work ko ngayon at hindi ko pa naman sobrang kailangan mag resign but nasasayangan kasi ako sa panahon na dapat ginugugol ko na sa career na gusto kong pasukin. 

Pls share your thoughts about this, do you think it’s worth it? Itutuloy ko ba o wag muna?  Like what do you think will happen once na tinuloy ko? May experience na rin ba kayong ganitong issue?

27,HR declared AWOL and blocklisted my gf sa buong city,"So my gf is a fresh grad with 5-month HR assistant experience from a big company, then we had to relocate so nag-apply sya ng panibago dito sa small company (ibang city na) as HR Assistant ulit. She was hired after a month after application. Turns out, may hinire pala sila don sa position but nag-AWOL bago mag-1 month (na nagets din namin later on dahil super toxic pala ng heads + 8-5pm 6x a week +  minimum wage BUT solong handle nya almost lahat ng HR function from recruitment, training, payroll, compensation, admin works, may hearing duties pa, etc.)

So going back to the story. A month into the job, my gf was sick one morning (nilalagnat at malala ang migraine) so hindi agad nakapag-update sa gc nila. Her work starts at 8am, dineclare sya as AWOL at 8:30am despite saying her reasons. The HR insulted her + pina-blacklist daw sya sa buong city para ""wala kang mapala"" and didn't give her pay ng almost kinsenas worth 6k. The company won't also give back her original medical.

28,Need advice regarding my job,"Since last year pa ko naghahanap ng work and unfortunately, di ako nahire sa dream company ko.

May mga experience rin ako na hindi maganda like may HR sa isang private company na nagpapunta sa akin for initial interview tapos nagpapunta ulit for the second time na akala ko 2nd interview (nag-email and text sila kaya inassume ko na talagang pinapapunta ko) tapos kung kailan nakapunta na ko dun sa location at nag-commute (2 jeeps pa sinakyan ko) tsaka sasabihin na nagkamali daw sila. Di man lang nagsend sa akin ng regret letter kung talagang rejected ako.

Come March, nahire ako sa isang private company as probi. Malapit lang yung location sa amin at ginrab ko na rin dahil wala pang response dun sa ibang companies na inapplyan ko. In line din siya kahit papano sa tinapos kong course.

Kaya lang napansin ko na medyo mababa yung rating nila sa mga Job Seeking sites at wala pang 4.0. May mga negative reviews din from former and current employees.

Nung app process, napansin ko rin dun sa HR office yung mga kasabay kong employees nila na nagfile na for resignation at nagke-clearance na at yung iba inaasikaso final pay nila. Compressed din yung work week and may mga rules pa pagdating sa clothes and hair color.

After 1 month of working, parang medyo may regret na inaccept ko yung offer to work there at nakita ko yung point kung bakit nga mababa yung rating nung company. Nakasulat sa pinirmahan ko na Monday to Friday yung sched ko kaso sabi gagawin daw Tuesday til Weekends. I have two bosses pa and magkaiba yung KPIs na sinet nila for me. Sa totoo lang parang di ko alam kung sino sa kanilang dalawa yung susundin ko. Yung isang boss na sinabing stick muna sa Mon-Fri sched, biglang hinahanap ako ng weekend (Sat) kahit di pa officially narerevise yung sched ng Tues-Sat.

Gusto niya yata wag na ko magholiday eh. Hahaha.  Sa totoo lang, kahit they're trying to be organized, narealize ko na ang gulo ng sistema nila. Wala pa rin akong laptop til now. Tsaka kapag pumapasok ako sa office, parang ang dull or blue nung feeling. Parang ganun yung nafefeel ko sa working environment/atmosphere. Parang hindi ako ganun ka-motivated or lively na pumasok.

Nafefeel ko rin na may mga ka-team din akong aalis at eventually baka sa akin ipasa yung tasks nila at baka maging one-man team pa ko. Which I don't want kasi feel ko hindi ko rin mamamanage nang maayos.

Aminado ako parang naging desperate din ako because of my financial situation at pagiging unemployed for several months kaya ginrab ko na kahit may mga nabasa kong negative things about the company.

As a probi employee, I need your advice. Should I just finish na lang my probi term then wag na magparegular tapos leave na? Or pilitin kong kahit maka-1 year lang then go na? Di ko kasi sure kung makakatagal talaga ko dito sa company eh. I really want to try my luck again sa pag-aapply sa dream company ko.

36,Micromanager got worse after I messed up,"I just transferred to a new role for a pioneer team this year. Our boss is also new to managing direct reports but they had previous experience as a project manager. 



SO ETO NA NGA -- Nag VL ako a couple of weeks back and had to turn over my tasks to a colleague. There was one task on my turnover that I emphasized was very critical and needed to be closely monitored during the time I will be away.



Kaso, may iba pa palang issue na sumabog during that time kaya ayun yung natutukan ni colleague. So ending, I had to catch up on the critical task when I came back.



All was sort of well after that, until it wasn't. Granted, I do believe na may lapses ako along the way, and that I could have done most things better now that I thought about it. Pero at the back of my head, pioneer team din kasi kami and I am still learning some of the ropes. There were some things I couldn't have had the foresight nor the agility to react on because it wasn't that familiar to me yet.



So andito na tayo sa part na sumasabog na. Manager kept at it on the chats, asking all the questions. At sa bawat tanong na nasasagot ko, meron siyang mga 2 to 3 questions pa.



Again, since may sabog tinanggap ko yung pag-helicopter niya. Down to the point na naka-bullet form na yung next steps of action ko at tinanggap ko na lang. At bawat galaw ko kinaklaro ko din kung okay sa kanya.



Pero dumating yung time na sobrang hindi ko na kinaya yung micromanaging during the crisis. It reached at point na yung mga ginagawa kong tasks to prevent things from turning worse to worst got affected.. kada chat ni Manager nara-rattle na ako so ending nagkakamali na ako sa mga updates at outputs na binibigay ko.



Nung napapansin ni Manager yung mga mali ko, sinabihan niya ako na ""nagbabago yung mga updates ko sa management dahil nagbabago din yung binibigay mo sakin"". Yung utak ko gusto nang sumagot ng: ""k\*ng ina, kung binigyan mo ako ng onting space kesa chat ka nang chat every 5 mins baka nagawa ko nang tama yung kailangan kong gawin to fix this in the first place.""



Sa last call namin during the crisis, aware ako na nagkaroon na ng tension sa aming dalawa ni Manager, aware din ako na nagreflect yung tension na yun sa tono ng boses ko at some point. 



But this ""sabog""/crisis was not the first time I felt that I was being micromanaged. I already started seeing signs after returning from VL. I knew of the tips/articles on how to handle micromanagers (reverse micro, communicate, etc) pero di ko ginawa before this crisis kasi iniisip ko na baka may pressure din kay Manager as the one leading our pioneer team. But I also really have this strong feeling that my Manager doesn't trust me. At all. Most especially after the crisis that had happened.



\*\*\*\*What do I do next?



May 1on1 kami soon and honestly I don't know whether to still hope for the best. I know I should expect the worst, but that's it. Nung nag request ako ng 1on1 sa kanya tinanong ko kung aware siya sa feedback ng iba about me (malaki daw kasi ulo ko -- just bc I am outspoken and can be blunt if needed) pero sabi ni Manager hindi daw siya aware at wala daw siya pake. Dapat ba ako maconvince? My overthinking brain is spiraling.



Now, just seeing their name, imagining the next time we will talk, already brings me so much anxiety that my head and breathing couldn't handle.



Other concerns:



1. Manager is also strict about the team reporting to the office daily kahit may WFH credits kami. Hindi daw pwede gamitin yun since hindi naman nacommit sa management na may WFH sa weekly schedule namin. But the credits are still part of our comp/ben.

---- On the other hand, Manager is on a 2x a week WFH sched



2. They assign tasks that are out of our JD but are part of their JD -- including coaching other team members.



3. Their micromanaging doesn't end with us but extends also to other cross-functional colleagues. Kapag may task that we need support from those people, iba daw yung tono ng pakikipag usap niya virtually. Parang nag uutos lang sa subordinate kahit same job level.



4. During KPI discussion, Manager started by asking questions to seemingly check-in on me but it sounded transactional. The aligned KPIs were thankfully based on my JD but right after that session, they just went back to delegating tasks that weren't part of my job nor contributory to my KPI.



Ayoko mag resign kasi okay naman ako sa company at sobrang okay ako sa ibang kawork ko. Pero bat ganun si Manager? HUHU",5,5,0.86,True,Rant 😡,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/1by4mip/micromanager_got_worse_after_i_messed_up/,2024-04-07 21:33:56,1by4mip

62,Rant: Suddenly not regularized for stupid reason,"Sa job ko, kapag mareregular ka na pinapapasa ka ng regularization request sa site ng company.
2 weeks ago sabi sakin ng supervisor ko magpasa na raw ako by April 9. So basically he already gave me an assurance that I'll be regularized. 
Last Saturday yung pinakaboss nakita ako sa station ng workmate ko na admin kasi nag aask ako ng details about sa regularization (eiya nag aasikaso non). Foreigner siya so di niya naiintindihan pinaguusapan namin akala nakikipagkwentuhan lang kami. At that same day piniem ng mga leads yung dalawang kausap ko, ako hindi. It was only a couple of minutes talking to my co worker tapos they had to schedule a meeting that same day.
nung pumasok ako after our day off (April 9) I messaged my supervisor about the details ng regularization form na ipapasa ko sa website then suddenly sinabi sakin na di raw ako ireregular kasi nakita raw ako nakikipag chat lang sa iba ???
Then pinapunta ako sa HR, even yung HR di makapaniwala, kasi kung d raw mareregular one month pa lang sasabihan na, pero mag sisix months na dapat ako at yun na yung day ng pasahan ng form. Then kinonvince ako na magresign na lang on that same day tas bibigyan nila ko ng severance pay mga 50k+. 
So nagresign na lang ako agad kahit sobrang gulat ako sa mga nangyari. It just fucking sucks, it's so unfair, it's so stupid and now I have to look for a new job but it's hard to look for a job with the same salary na meron ako sa company na yon.

65,I'm tired of working for this company,"Created this burner account because I don't want to use my main reddit account. lol  
So I'm a developer from this company(you can guess what company) for 3 years na. Got lucky to get a project that aligns sa role ko, but now that yung hybrid setup nila is more strict, need na pumasok at least 4x a month which is so draining in my part. I live in the province btw and it's a 12-15 hours trip to manila. for my hybrid set up I opt to go 4 days in one week since I have to comply, may pa check in narin kasi na application if nag office ka on a certain day.

Going for the 4 days straight in a week set up, here's my routine. Travel from my province before the work day at night after shift via bus, then on the next day after arriving sa manila go to office without rest (wala naman makakaalam di pa naligo haha). Then after work check-in on some cheap hotel then checkout for the next day, and repeat until last day of office week.

They probably didn't plan this stupid hybrid setup well, since i go to office struggling to find a seat to find out someone is seated there, note that seats can be reserved but still difficult specially on thursday and friday where majority of employees like to go to office on these days.

Does the company pay my travel expenses? NO!

So here's my experience of why I'm so tired na.

Sahod ko is 0 after this office trip, since wala ako titirahan sa manila i have to check-in on a cheap hotel, my expenses on food and water goes to convenient store food just to not go hungry for the day. don't even force me to find a place to rent since I'm a dev i need a place with stable internet preferably my own ISP, i dont want some random public wifi, and at this time and situation in manila I feel it's impossible to find a place to rent.

Personal life has been a rollercoaster. I'm a breadwinner and giving allowance to my sibling who is studying in manila, thankfully they're set to graduate in a few months. Another is i have a parent that has a medical condition that of course needs money to be treated i.e. maintenance medicine etc., not just this, I my self also take meds to be specific psychiatric meds, let say i have depression i wont disclose further details. with this hybrid setup yung financial stability ko is going down the drain.

That concludes my story haha, gusto ko lang share while i contemplate if makakahanap ba ako ng new work, preferably remote since in my experience ngayon that manila feels like hell and will become worse.

67,Would you resign?,"Hey guys! Wanted to get your thoughts on a decision I’ve made and see whether or not its something na you guys would consider as a good move or a bad one.

So I’ve been in my current company for almost 3 years and I’ve decided to resign because I finally got physically and mentally tired from everything I’m doing — things like biyahe, people you have to work with, demand at work, and all that stuff. I spend most of my time commuting (I live in Taguig and my office is a bit far that it takes me 3-4 hrs to get there and probably 4-5 hrs going home.). 

I barely have time to prepare anything in the morning and at night because I need to make sure I make it to work because I don’t want to be late. My bf mentioned that I’ve been agitated lately, always sleeping during our dates and  barely having any energy to spend time with him on any activities(bless his patience).

Just a few days ago, I submitted my letter!  But I don’t have a job yet, all of my leaders are asking me to retract and they kept mentioning that they’ll give me a raise so I could stay and possible rent but I don’t want to rent and be away from my family since I’m also contributing sa stuff sa bahay and I don’t really like the place I’m working at anymore to be honest.

Problem now is I have to find one ASAP because I have 2 weeks left from my chosen last day and I don’t have that much of a saving that would last me till end of this year, baka nga 3 months lang e hahahaz

My leaders are still okay with me retracting my resignation pero would you choose ba to be unemployed for x number of months just to rest and find a better opportunity that’s more healthy or should I just bear with everything till I find a new job?


Edit: adding some addtl info that might help in you guys giving your opinion

1. I perform well naman ata in my job hehe, I’m given big tasks and I’m actually in line for a manager position but I don’t think I want it din kasi I don’t feel I’m at that level yet

71,Healthcare BPO Shrouded Misdeeds in the Call Center Sector - Featuring Sagility,"
As Labor Day shines a glaring light on the workforce of the Philippines, it exposes the unsettling truth lurking within the call center realm, with Sagility emerging as a juxtaposition of excellence in healthcare services and a harbinger of labor malpractice.

Beneath the veneer of professionalism and the crucial domain of healthcare assistance lies a narrative of bias deeply woven into Sagility's core. The recruitment procedures, the inaugural interaction between employer and employee, are tainted by whispers of partiality and discrimination, overshadowing competence and sowing seeds of discontent from the very beginning.

For those navigating this skewed path to employment, the assurance of timely remuneration often fades into a harsh reality of wage delays. This not only destabilizes financial security but also exposes a troubling disregard for the fundamental rights of laborers. The weight on an employee awaiting a belated paycheck transcends mere oversight; it epitomizes a blatant neglect for the sustenance of the workforce.

More alarming are the accounts of unlawful dismissals, a specter of uncertainty looming over every employee. This anxiety is exacerbated by the purported acceptance of sexual misconduct, a reprehensible stain that corrodes the essence of the workplace. These occurrences, often swept under the rug and veiled in silence, not only victimize the workforce but also embody a corporate ethos that values profit over the welfare of its people.

Rather than standing as a beacon in the healthcare sector, Sagility appears to capitalize on the vulnerability of job seekers, many of whom feel compelled to endure such hardships. The company's operational approach, seemingly prioritizing cost efficiencies over ethical standards, casts a foreboding shadow over its integrity and sparks vital dialogs on the sustainability of such business paradigms.

This Labor Day, the clarion call for transformation reverberates loud and clear. Entities like Sagility must be held answerable for their deeds. Merely pursuing economic prosperity at the expense of moral decay is untenable. The time beckons for industry-wide metamorphosis, stringent regulatory surveillance, and a unified stance against the exploitation of Filipino laborers. While we laud the toil and commitment of the workforce, let us pledge to shield them from predatory behaviors. The valor of a flourishing industry ought to be gauged by the respect, equity, and dignity it bestows upon its workforce.

4. If sa Cebu ang location ng office and nasa Rizal ako, paano ang decision making noon sa case? What will happen if hindi sila magshow up sa scheduled conference twice, may schedule na kasi for first conference sa April 18.

78,OJT being bullied by officemates. ,"TLDR: Title. (warning: super long post ahead) (another warning: idk if this belongs here, pls kindly tell me nalang if it doesn't, i just really wanna know your insights) 

So I am currently rendering my OJT and at first akala ko it would be great but it was the full opposite of great. My workmates were kind at first but overtime, they showed their true colors. For context, matatanda na sila like 40 up. There are times na sinasabon nila ako like ginagauge nila yung ""yaman"" ko (i'm middle class lang naman) just because OJT palang daw and nakalatest iphone na ako and branded bag. They went so far as to ask about my siblings' salary, position, where we live, what businesses we have, etc. Akala ko naman nung una okay lang kasi bago pa ko baka curious lang but it didn't stop - when I went to another country for a certain concert they asked me magkano ticket, sino nagbayad, saang hotel and what airlines like why do you have to know? 







So at first naassign ako sa admin, and so I was doing admin work. Scan here, photocopy there, and everywhere. Minsan taga stapler ng papel, taga tanggal ng stapler, taga alis ng paperclip and what have you. There's also this one time na pinagawa sakin ng isang officemate ko yung blue book nya for notary. 500 documents arranged AND handwritten sa book na yon. You can imagine yung nakalagay don sa hinandwrite ko, name of parties, witness, ID number, etc., 500 of that in one book. Eh tatlong libro nya pinagawa sakin yun. Edi okay, yes lang nang yes kasi pabibo ko e. Tuwang tuwa naman sila sakin. One time, tinanong ako if gusto ko na ba sa company na to maregular (usapan namin at first ay iaabsorb ako that's why sakanila ako nagpunta), umoo nalang ako kahit deep inside ayaw ko kasi walang ginagawa masyado, no growth talaga. Sabi ba naman sakin, ""oo, dapat ganyan ka lang oo ka lang nang oo sa utos para maregular ka dito"". ??? ano ako puppet ??? 



 One time, may pinascan sakin and nagkamali ako when marami na naprint, my other officemate shouted at me like literal na shout kasi rinig na rinig ng ibang dept eh sabi nya ""ako na nga! nabbwisit ako sayo mali mali naman gawa mo!"" edi okay. i let it pass, di ko pinatulan. pero after that, I went to the HR manager and asked to be transferred departments because hindi ako naggrow sa current position ko. and while I know it may sound demanding, unpaid internship to and knowledge talaga habol ko.... ano makukuha ko sa pagsstapler na knowledge? haha. pero di ko na minention yung pagiging toxic, i thought kakayanin ko. not until nakalipat na ako ng dept and kung ano ano ginawa nila sakin. 













everyday nalang may issue. sa suot ko, porke paiba iba daw ako ng damit. sa paglipat ko, porke magpphotocopy lng din naman daw ako dito. btw, that's not true at all. dito, natuto ako magprocess ng documents, nakakausap ako ng clients, natututo makipagcommunicate with government offices and nalalaman pano gawin ang mga bagay bagay. 


anyways, ayun nga inaattack talaga nila ako. one time an officemate told me ""ganda ng suot mo ah pero naka motor ka LANG naman."" Ok? And? Anong mali sa motor? Ngayon naman I heard them saying na kaya lang naman daw ako nagpalipat dahil ayaw ko matuto. There was also one time na may pakain na donut and sabi sakin kalahati nalang daw akin. And simula ng nalipat ako at nabigyan ng sariling office, lagi silang nagpupunta sa harap ng office ko (transparent door), and tinitignan ano ginagawa ko. Malas naman na lagi ako naabutan na tapos na sa work so pinagkakalat naman nila ngayon e natutulog lang daw ako sa office. 





Ang dami pang iba like sobrang hostile ng treatment sakin pero tiniis ko lahat kasi kailangan e. But now na I'm nearing the end of my OJT, tapos na ko makisama. Now, I wanna know your insights. I have documented everything (screenshots, voice records, video, pic, etc.). May karapatan ba ako to report this? May maiiwan pa kasing mga OJT after ko, and I badly wanna break the cycle. Even my boss and other departments - same ng kwento sakin, na ganyan talaga sila.



I'm just wondering if pasok ba to sa Right to a Safe Space or what? What do you think I should do? 









P.S. I talked to the HR manager already about this, and sabi nya lang sakin ""Ganyan talaga ang buhay. At least now you know. I'm not sorry for your situation."" so talking sa HR would do no good. I'm thinking about coming straight sa executives as I have their contact naman. 


P.P.S., sorry for the format I'm on mobile.

Possible scenarios pag nahulog ka sa patibong na ito:
1. Kung friends si TL at HR, isulat mo na resignation letter mo. HAHAHA

2. Kung sa small team nyo ay ikaw lang naman ang kinukupal ni TL, he can easily deduce na sayo galing ang nega feedback na yun kahit di sabihin ni HR name mo. Aware si TL na sayo lang sya ganun eh.

3. Makakarating at makakarating kay TL yan syempre. Anong gagawin sa negative feedback? Pababayaan lang? Malamang kausapin ni HR un.

83,Title or Compensation? Also shifting jobs to a client?,"Been on my 1st company (an foreign-based company with around 100+ employees in SEA) for almost 1.5yrs now as an Engineer, currently earning a base salary of 20.5k Pesos and they annouced last week they would elevate my position to a Senior role by the start of May due to ome of our seniors resigning. The elevation would come with a training in a foreign country and possibly a 1yr bond with it. Would probably get an increase to around 25k or 28k if I'm lucky enough haha. But due to the nature of this company, more on the implementation/construction side, work-life balance is almost non-existent din and the stress is slow building up on me even on a lower role. Handling around 5 sites at times, supporting and teaching junior engrs despite being a junior myself based on the yrs of experience.

Now there is this other company which is a client of ours aswell and been working on a project for them since the start of the year. It is a well known government based company in Manila, and you've probably seen this company anywhere. They have been offering me to apply for an outsourced engineering position for the job I'm currently working on for them for around 36k as per the Engineer I've spoke to. The nature of work would be diffrent as it would be more on the operations and project management side instead of being the one implementing. I've told the engineer that I want to focus on developing projects more over than the operations side if I am to apply for the said role, in which he did agree, knowing that I'm really after the experience. The application in this company usually take 2-3 months to finish.

The problem now is wether I choose to stay on my current company and take the senior title, training, and 1 year bond but probably end up with a lower compensation or choose the other offer with a higher offer but as an outsourced engineer. Also comparing the commute, my current company is based in Pasig which is farther that that in Manila as I'm currently staying in Sampaloc, Manila which is far better both in time and money.

As I've also mentioned the other company is alsonour client, it may be a bit awkward to tell this to my current employer. Would like to know more tips on how to handle this types of things too.

86,NAMO-MOTIVATE AKONG MAG-RESIGN DAHIL SA BOSS KONG NAKAKAGIGIL ANG FAVORITISM ,"So today, for the first and forever, may concern ako sa boss ko.

Backgrounder lang, 8 months palang ako sa company. Fresh grad. Ayokong i-disclose anong kumpanya kasi sobrang few lang naman pero media company siya. Researcher ako doon.

Eto na nga, hindi ko yung tipo ng empleyado na bida-bida sa boss or sa ginagawa. Bago lang naman ako, well most of us are new and fresh grad kasi sa ganon binuild ng company yung bagong system nila simula nung nagkaroon ng venture. Syempre madaming fresh grad kaya nung umpisa kong pasok e madaming bida.

Medyo may experience na rin ako magtrabaho thru part time jobs kaya may kaunti na akong alam sa kalakaran ng mga korporasyon pero grabe di ko in-expect yung ganito kalala.

Nature of work na namin ang stressed at burn out dahil sa pressure ng mga programa. Pero hindi kasi ako yung tipong bida kid nga, like I said. Ginagawa ko naman best ko pero it's not something na dapat kong ipangalandakan tsaka ino-observe ko rin personal growth ko sa lahat ng ginagawa ko.

Nung unang 2 months ko, halos araw-araw umiiyak ako kasi sobrang hirap ng ginagawa. Hindi ganon yung trabahong in-expect ko. Nakakawala pa ng gana kasi ang baba ng sahod. Mas malaki pa sahod ko sa mga part time ko noon kaysa dito pero tiyagaan kasi may gusto akong i-build na skill na related sa tinapos ko.

Di rin ako yung tipo ng empleyado na puro reklamo, teachable akong tao, mahilig akong magtanong, at humingi ng tulong kapag di ko alam. Dinadahan-dahan ko kasi hindi naman madali ang process ng growth lalo na at hindi rin ako yung magaling sa mga bagay-bagay. Hanggat kaya naman, kakayanin.

Pero nitong mga nakaraang linggo, nung kasagsagan ng init, gusto ko ng magsabi sa boss ko. 2PM to 10PM ang shift ko tapos bumabyahe ako almost 3 hrs mula sa amin hanggang sa site. Huwag niyo na akong tanungin kung bat di ako nagre rent.
1. Ang mahal ng rent sa lugar na yun.
2. Ang baba ng sahod ko, nagbibigay ako sa pamilya ko, sa kapatid ko, basically, wala pa akong maayos na ipon. Nagkaroon pa ng emergency na gastusin nung March kaya sobrang higpit na ng sunturon.
3. Ayoko pang iwanan si mama kasi wala naman siyang maaasahan dito sa bahay kundi ako.

Eto na nga, sobrang init ng panahon. Yung energy ko kapag papasok 0% na, nung isang araw akala ko hihikain ako sa sobrang init pero kailangan ko ng lakad para mag-trabaho. Kinekwento ko na siya sa co-researcher ko na 5 yrs ahead kaysa saken. Sabi niya di naman daw masama kung ira-raise ko concern ko. Kaso di ko ginawa kasi parang ang weird lang. Haha. Kaso ano namang solusyin gagawin non? E bawal kami sa wfh. Allergic kumpanyang yun sa wfh set up.

Ang nagpa-trigger sa akin na i-raise yun e itong co-researcher ko rin. Sa shift kasi na 2pm to 10pm, dalawa kami. Nagsasalitan kami sa programa. E nabalitaan niya biglang ililipat siya sa umaga.

Sa limang researcher, dalawa non, umaga, isang mid-day, at dalawang late day-night (kami yun). So kung lilipat siya sa umaga diba dapat may papalit sa shift na aalisan niya? E wala kami naririnig na papalit sa shift niya kaya itong ka-shift ko, ang sabi niya sa akin, i-raise ko na yung concern ko sa boss namin. Sabi ko, bakit? Kasi raw kawawa ako pag nilipat siya sa umaga e pati raw mga producer namin, maglilipatan. Kawawa raw ako sa producer na mapupunta saken if ever. Idk kung sinasalba niya ako or what pero ang point ko e gusto ko mag-raide ng concern sa shift ko kasi di na kaya ng pagod ko.

Nung minessage ko yung boss namin, nagtanong siya ng suggestion ko. Sabi ko, baka pwede ako sa mas maagang shift. 

Ang response ba naman niya sa akin, ""NAKU HINDI PWEDE KASI KUNG LAHAT KAYO NASA AM SHIFT, WALANG MAIIWAN SA PANG 2PM TO 10PM."" 

Nagulat ako sa response kasi IF I COMPREHEND IT RIGHT, AKO LANG MAIIWAN SA SHIFT NA YUN MAG-ISA??? LIKE ALL PROGRAMS SA SHIFT NA YUN SA AKIN???? HUH??? ARE U OK??? 🥹😭

Hindi ko pa rin nirereplyan boss ko sa message niya na yan 12 hrs mahigit na nakakalipas hahahahaha sabi ko kakausapin ko siya sa opisina niya kaso pagdating ko, wala na siya. Tinakasan na ata ako 🤣 yung mga nasa AM shift kasi mga takot magpanghapon ata kasi natatakot sa hard news at sa magiging producer. Baka pati anchors kinatatakutan nila. Pero kung makapagyabang sila ng posisyon at ginagawa nila parang sinalo nila lahat ng programa.

Di ko alam ire-reply ko. Ang gulo na nga ng sistema ng management pero iniintindi kasi gawa ng bago lang ulit, pati ba naman mga tao sa pwesto, magulo rin? 🥴🥹

So paano na 'to? Lalo akong namo-motivate mag-resign. Haha.

Di pa pala ako tapos mag-kwento. Ito na yung part ng favoritism:

Madami na nakapapansin nito e. Meron siyang pinapaburan lang na mga tao. More like close sa kanya or mga feeling close charot hahaha

May isang beses kasi na nagre-request ako ng new computer kasi tangina binigyan ba naman ako ng bulok na computer to the point na personal laptop ko na ang ginamit ko kasi hindi na productive trabaho ko dahil sa celeron ata yon na computer HAHAHA kahit MS WORD na walang internet connection, hindi gumagana ampota. Tapos pag sinasabi ko tinititigan lang ako.

Di pa ako magkakaroon ng maayos na gamit doon kung hindi pa inoffer sa akin nung FAVORITE NIYANG RESEARCHER yung company laptop niya mismo (si boss) na pinahiram niya sa researcher na yun kahit maganda naman desktop na gamit ni researcher.

Tapos ngayong may bagong researcher, AYUN, NAGKAROON SIYA BIGLA NG MAGANDA AT MABILIS NG COMPUTER????? KAYA NAMAN PALA GAWAN NG PARAAN BAKIT HINDI NAGAWA NUNG AKO YUNG NAGRE-REQUEST. KINGINA.

With the pandemic over, WFH arrangements in economic zones to no longer have tax incentives-- Sec Remulla

Now that the Covid-19 pandemic has ended, work-from-home (WFH) arrangements of registered business enterprises (RBEs) located in economic zones should no longer get tax incentives under Republic Act (RA) No. 11534, the Corporate Recovery and Tax Incentives for Enterprises (CREATE) Act.

In a  legal opinion issued last Jan. 3, Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin C. Remulla said that “Section 309 of R.A. No. 11534 specifically requires registered projects or activities under an Investment Promotion Agency (IPA) administering an economic zone or freeport to be exclusively conducted or operated within the geographical boundaries of the zone or freeport, and any project or activity conducted or performed outside the zone or free port shall not be entitled to the incentive under CREATE Act.”

The legal opinion was issued at the request of Presidential Management Staff Undersecretary for Legal and Monitoring Rodolfo John Robert C. Pallatao IV.

Pallatao sought the legal opinion due to the conflicting stance of five government agencies -- the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), the Philippine Economic Zone (PEZA), the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA), the Fiscal Incentives Review Board (FIRB), and the Office of the Presidential Adviser on Investment and Economic Affairs (OPAIEA) -- on whether WFH arrangements of RBEs, particularly in the Information Technology and Business Process Management (IT-BPM) sector, should get tax incentives under the CREATE Law now that the state of emergency for the Covid-19 pandemic has been lifted.

Remulla cited that Section 309 of RA 11534 states: “A qualified registered project or activity under an Investment Promotion Agency administering an economic zone or freeport shall be exclusively conducted or operated within the geographical boundaries of the zone or freeport being administered by the Investment Promotion Agency in which the project or activity is registered…any project or activity conducted or performed outside the geographical boundaries of the zone or freeport shall not be entitled to the incentives provided in this Act, unless such project or activity is conducted or operated under another Investment Promotion Agency.”

Thus, he said, “business enterprises located in the economic or freeport zone must continue to conduct their activities within the zone boundaries if they wish to continue availing of their tax incentives under the CREATE Act.”

He pointed out that “these enterprises are not prohibited from adopting a WFH arrangement but will no longer be eligible to continue enjoying the tax incentives.”

He, however, acknowledged that there exists RA 11165, the Telecommuting Act, that was signed into law on Dec. 20, 2018 and concerns “work from an alternative workplace with the use of telecommunications and/or computer technologies.”

In the event of conflict between the two laws, Remulla said the provisions of RA 11534 which was signed into law on March 26, 2021 should prevail “being the last expression of the legislative will.”

“In enacting a statute, the legislative is presumed to have been aware of, and have taken into account, prior laws on the subject of legislation,” he explained.

He noted that even the FIRB recognized the provisions of RA 11534 when the board issued FIRB Resolution Nos. 003-22 and 017-22 that allowed RBEs of the IT-BPM sector to adopt the WFH arrangement.

But he explained that the FIRB resolutions were issued as “a temporary measure as provided under Rule 23 of the CREATE IRR (implementing rules and regulations).”

“Once the exceptional circumstance, such as pandemic, epidemic, war, armed conflict, state of national emergency, outbreak of diseases, international or regional financial crisis, or analogous circumstances, ceases to exist, or in this case the issuance of Proclamation No. 297 dated 21 July 2023, lifting the State of Public Health Emergency throughout the Philippines, the temporary measure shall also cease to exist,” he said.


He recounted that FIRB issued Resolutions 026- 226 and 033-227 that allowed RBEs in the IT-BPM sector that have remaining tax incentives under Sec. 311 of the CREATE Act or those with approved incentives on or before September 2022 the option to register with the Board of Investments (BOI) from an ecozone or freeport zone Investment Promotion Agency (IPA) and adopt up to 100 percent WFH arrangement.

“This locational prohibition does not apply to enterprises registered with the BOI as it does not administer an ecozone or freeport,” he said.
