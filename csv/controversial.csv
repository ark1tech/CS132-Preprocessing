2023-12-05 15:50:31,Text-only,I am on leave today but I still check my messages. But not for the reason that you think.,"I used to be the guy na LAHAT ginagawa voluntarily. Very very proactive. But as time went by, wala namang nadudulot na maganda sakin professionally yung pagiging proactive ko. Yeah I got promoted and learned skills but a lot has changed since then, less people in the team kasi nagsialisan na sila, redundant work, and not a chance to improve myself career-wise.

Even if I try to do things better for the team, I am forced to stick to my specific tasks. Ang ending? Nadadamay ako sa inefficiency ng pagpapaktakbo ng team namin. 

Now, pag nakaleave ako, I still check my messages but only to see the team *squirm*. I find pleasure in seeing that everything is tumbling down just because of their inept leadership. Ayaw nila maghire ng tao, ayaw magtaas ng sahod, ayaw mag promote. Edi magtiis kayo. 

I've been actively applying for roles pero medyo mahirap ang job market ngayon. If ever I get a really good offer, I'll leave.

Anyone else here who used to be a really proactive contributor na nawalan na rin ng gana?",0,0,0.5,Story üó£Ô∏è,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/18b6z9e/i_am_on_leave_today_but_i_still_check_my_messages/,18b6z9e

It creates large gap of divide sa buying power ng mga tao, not everyone works in outsourcing so not everyone competitive ang salary na idinikta ng mga outsourcing company. local companies just cannot afford to compete.
2. Sustainability - with all the threats like
   1. AI - a lot of job will disappear because of AI, we know this.  
   2. Govt policies - we kind of know na problematic din ang mga bansa kung saan nag hehead quarter ang mga companies ng outsourcing. may social problem sila, antaas ng poverty rate nila. It only make sense na pwersahin nila ang mga company to create jobs locally. they turn blind eye dahil gahaman. pero i believe na ito ang solution for them.

2023-05-21 21:53:24,Text-only,Why don't we call (US)americans who work in the Philippines Overseas American workers instead of expats?,"Most white people or generally people who is of European descent when working in the Philippines are called ""expats"". But other asian or african nationalities don't call themselves expats when they work in a foreign country(in general). We are labelled Overseas Filipino Workers when we work abroad or migrant workers. But both terms generally mean ""foreign workers"" . If youre brown- migrant worker, if youre white- expat. I checked some sites and I asked chatgpt the difference between the two terms and here is the generated answer.

\-

Expats (Expatriates): The term ""expat"" typically refers to individuals who voluntarily choose to live and work abroad temporarily or permanently. They often relocate for various reasons such as job opportunities, career advancement, lifestyle preferences, or personal circumstances. Expats often enjoy certain privileges and benefits, such as higher income, company-provided accommodations, and support networks. They may maintain strong ties to their home country and have the intention of returning eventually.  
  
Migrant Workers: On the other hand, the term ""migrant workers"" refers to individuals who move to another country primarily for employment opportunities. Migrant workers often come from countries with lower economic opportunities and seek better livelihoods abroad. They may face challenges such as language barriers, exploitation, limited legal protections, and social integration difficulties. Migrant workers often perform lower-skilled jobs and may have limited access to the benefits and privileges that expats enjoy.

\-

But then again not all migrant workers perform lower skilled jobs and not all foreign workers are from third world countries. South Korea is a first world country, but when they work outside of they home country they dont go around calling themselves expats or no one dare label them expats cause ykyk.

Why not just use a term that doesn't factor race and privileges? Youre from Nigeria, okay Overseas Nigerian Worker. from Australia? Overseas Australian Worker. From Finland? Overseas Finnish Worker. Cause it really irks me that these people of European descent gets a lot more favourable treatment in general when they are no different from many other foreign workers. Like dude your are not working in your country of origin therefore you are a foreign worker. But then I realized a lot of us Filipinos love kissing white men's asses. They get more favourable treatment, better pay regardless of cost of living, qualification and etc. But disregard that, yknow, even out the playing field. Overseas (Insert Nationality) Worker isn't an offensive term, next time you catch an expat calling themselves expats- try the term to bother them, like a joke. Until the this joke becomes real and serious.

Don't work for this certain company...

Although I won't be telling the name of the company yet (since they still have my final pay and might held it for ransom or something, idk), please avoid this company if you can. For those who want to know the company name, hit me a DM.

This company, related to ""law"" is based in the US (won't be telling its exact location since they might not give my final pay if they got a wind of this), and isn't trustful of their employees.

Usually, most companies (whether On-Site, Hybrid, or WFH) have one or two time tracking apps for their employees. But this... This requires THREE (3) separate time trackers, one of those being notorious for disconnecting ANY wireless devices connected to your PC (and even Bluetooth devices). Heck, you even need to use a patch provided by the company to bypass that issue with that specific time tracker.

Another bad thing with that company is the required ALWAYS ON camera for your whole shift of 8 hours (minus 5 minute max bio breaks and just 30 min lunch -- all are not paid and you must adjust your time for it too), for ""monitoring purposes"". I find that totally bullcrap, as it shows that the company head sees its employees as disposable tools and not humans. Sure, there have been troublemakers in the past, but having an ALWAYS ON camera policy? Isn't that excessive and invasion of privacy too?

And they don't give a fuck with employee opinions and suggestions. You have a suggestion/questions with their so-called ""culture and policies""? Boom, you'll be like me, fired for ""rants against the company

and the dissemination of negative feedback internally and externally"". So, they're telling that our opinions about some stuff within the company is automatically a rant?! What a freaking joke. Tyranny at its finest.

They even had this on my termination letter:

""Your ethics do not align with the high standards we expect from our employees. Our company places great importance on integrity, professionalism, and adherence to ethical guidelines in all aspects of our operations.""

What a freaking bullcrap.

Sigh, my plans are ruined yet again, no thanks to what happened...

EDIT: I was terminated because of a ""snake"" that bit me in my back, from my own team.

EDIT2: Since many are giving me negative comments of me not revealing the name yet, you can DM for the company name instead.",1,9,0.57,Company alert üö©,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/1548q1x/do_not_work_for_this_company/,1548q1x

2023-06-15 12:31:51,Text-only,Company I work for ‚ÄúLost‚Äù $500 of my check due to a ‚Äúclock out system error‚Äù and now they refuse to give me the other half of my check‚Ä¶,"The company I work for gave us 1 day off for Memorial Day with holiday pay for that day instead of 10 hours we got 8 hours and the day off.  That‚Äôs 78 hours.

Instead of working 8 days (40 hours per week) we worked 7 days + 8 hours holiday pay. I know for a fact I worked the whole 7 days, I clocked in and out but ‚Äúthe system‚Äù shows I didn‚Äôt clock out 3-4 separate times in May which I know is an error. I since told 2 supervisors, contacted Payroll and told them in person. Instead of my regular $1600 paycheck holiday pay included I would of received on the 31st of May, my check was short over $500 dollars? And I only received $900. And it showed I only worked 50 hours not 78 which is what I would of had for this pay period because I worked my schedule the whole month didn‚Äôt take 1 day off.

I told 2 supervisors who weren‚Äôt really our supervisors because our supervisor got fired the week before this happened (weird right?) and now 2 weeks later‚Ä¶I still do not have the other part of my paycheck. I told PayRoll when my check came and I saw the error as well but they closed my support ticket same day and the 2 supervisors that was contacted did not give me an update. What do I do now?

- I come to work on time
- Clock in/ Clock out
- Do the job the best of my ability
- I haven‚Äôt taken 1 day off and all of May I‚Äôve had this ‚Äúerror‚Äù.

Why was my hours shortened intentionally and why is the other part of my check missing? And if they know this is an error, they haven‚Äôt even contacted me about giving me the other part of my check.

I am a young female and I work around I‚Äôd say 95% men. I am a minority and I don‚Äôt want to assume that my race or gender had anything to do with this. But for the last 3 months, they‚Äôve been talking behind my back, my leads expect ME to perform 200% when everyone else gets away with 75% They refuse to cover me when I go to the bathroom but when they go, they go whenever they want and their friends always cover them. There is only one guy who covers for me and he isn‚Äôt even from our area. 

When I started learning a lot of different work most of the men there do not respect me or my area and I‚Äôve been physically uncomfortable at times by things that were said and done to me and I went to HR in the past for the treatment I‚Äôve been receiving from an old Supervisor, yes, A SUPERVISOR and HR did nothing about it. 

Nowadays, I just don‚Äôt talk to anyone because everyone kisses each other‚Äôs behind. I stay away from that. I have social anxiety but that doesn‚Äôt stop me from doing my job and that doesn‚Äôt stop me from speaking up when something happens. But it‚Äôs the lack of empathy and lack of understanding that makes me NEVER speak up on what happens to me. And now of all things‚Ä¶I have to deal with lost wages?

I know this is a lot to try and understand for an outsider looking I. but I am calling on help from ANYONE who has knowledge of what this situation is and the next steps I should take are.

I‚Äôve been to HR so many times, PayRoll 3 times, talked with 2 Supervisors and nothing has been done. Not for the treatment, the harassment, the bullying, the lost wages or the missing time off my check? 

I just need help and I need the money from them but they haven‚Äôt given me anything in over 2 weeks. Just to confirm that they did absolutely nothing. I just got paid after using ALL of my PTO for the first time in 8 months and I got my SAME check! But my last check was short almost waaaay over half which is about $500-$600

I can‚Äôt quit and I can‚Äôt speak up. I can‚Äôt even get paid decently without them screwing up something and every time I bring an issue to their attention they brush it off. 

There is so much more that has happened‚Ä¶and I want to tell my story but I‚Äôm so afraid of it sounding like I‚Äôm ranting or complaining or making this up. I need to get out of this specific job and elevate within the company but THIS company has PURPOSELY LIMITED our ability to apply for other positions because every thing beyond being an associate requires you to have a B.S. degree and 5 years + experience in manufacturing. 

I want a way out of the position I‚Äôm in now. I know I have better potential than the work I do currently but, as a young woman with little to no voice in the company, no degree and limited options (quit or don‚Äôt quit being the only 2) I have no options. If you‚Äôre curious yes I am 100% independent, no family around, no boyfriend, no roommate, and no Emerald Mine from Daddy for 1,000s of miles. I am completely alone and I just feel like I‚Äôm reaching a breaking point. Maybe this is a sign to take up another full time job working nights? I am fine with that, I like working but I am sacrificing my sleep for it.

No hate naman sa mga FAs kasi I have applied for a life insurance myself din naman, pero some of my friends na FAs, most of the time they flex a lot about their vacations, investments, and all. 

I know a bit on how a career in financial advising works because nabiktima din ako ng ‚Äúinternship sa insurance companies‚Äù where I applied as an intern tapos they made me somewhat a recruiter. They even told me to take an exam (nakalimutan ko tawag) pero hindi ko tinake. 

I know this job is based on commissions talaga, so if walang mainsure, walang makukuha. Please correct me nalang po if I‚Äôm wrong. Then siguro, doon ko din napag isip isip na kaya siguro some of them are quite persistent when it comes to offering financial advising and life insurance is because kailangan nila ng commission, which is completely understandable because lahat naman tayo nagttrabaho to earn money. 

But anyway, ayun nga. I always feel na mas may nararating sila as compared to someone like me na stuck lang sa office work and repetitive lang ang ginagawa. Sometimes iniisip ko, what if I changed my career path into that? Would my life be any different than what it is now?

They always encourage people to join their team, to start their career with them‚Äîjust so we can enjoy perks like free flights abroad, be able to buy high-end laptops, and invest in condos or cars.

2023-12-05 13:57:59,Text-only,Protocol on changing schedules,"I was on my way to work yesterday. Ang schedule ng pasok ay 1 PM. From where I live, dapat 2 hrs before nakabyahe na ako since matraffic ang daan. Nakasakay na ako sa public transpo when around 1:15 PM, my supervisor messaged me na 3 PM na raw ang schedule ko. Nainis ko because ngayon lang sinabi? Di ko madalas nilalabas yung phone ko sa byahe kaya di ko nabasa agad. So i replied na ngayon ko lang nabasa etc. Ang sabi nya lang sa akin ay ""sorry, libot ka muna sa mall malapit dyan"". So nakiusap ako, saying na baka pwede 1 PM pa rin ako, extend na lang ako hanggang sa magsara yung store namin, which he agreed.

But all that was bulls**t. So nakapasok na ko before 1 PM. A few hours later, when he came to work kinausap nya ako, saying na 3PM pa rin daw ang schedule ko despite him agreeing at first? So i said back na late nya ako sinabihan and what if tagamalayong city pa ako? Ang rebut ba naman eh, protocol raw na 2hrs before the schedule pwede magsabi, di nya raw kasalanan na late ko nabasa at di naman daw ako malayong city nakatira??? Sino raw ang masusunod? Yung gusto ko raw na stick sa initial sched na binigay or yung sinabi nya na bagong schedule? Like what the???

So I came in early para lang bawiin yung sinabi nya? So I worked extra 2 hrs for nothing? OTY kumbaga.

Here's what makes my blood boil pa, that day, pagka-out, nagawa nyang magsabi sa 2 co-workers ko na may changes sa schedule nila the next day. F*ck that, nagawa nyang magsabi maaga sa kanila but sa akin less than 2 hrs before?

I feel disrepected sa sudden change of schedule and parang pinaparating nya na ako pa mali na hindi ko nabasa yung message nya. 

Is it really protocol na 2 hrs before (whereas less than 2 hrs pa nga) magsabi? Because it felt wrong.   Nakakabastos tbh.",0,0,0.5,Rant üò°,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/18b5azx/protocol_on_changing_schedules/,18b5azx

Pero isang araw, naramdaman lang bigla ni Bautista na nanlalamig ang kasamahan niya, tila ba ay may nagawa siyang mali. Inulit niya sa kanyang utak ang nangyari noong umaga hanggang dapit alas dos kung may mali ba sa nagawa niya at parang na offend niya ang kasamahan. Jinujustify niya na wala namang mali kasi lahat nang nagawa ay iyong mga karaniwan lamang lalo na sa pag-aasar at siya rin mismong ginagawa ng kasamahan - baka nga sobra pa - pero nauunawaan naman ni Bautista na pang-aasar lang lahat. 


Naguguluhan si Bautista kasi hindi niya alam anong gagawin. Bigla lang kasi hindi siya pinapansin - baka sobrang busy lang. Natanong niya sa sarili na pwede ba iyong idadaan sa pagbibigay ng silent treatment kung pressured sa trabaho at idamay ang kasamahan?

Baka nasobrahan lang din sa pag-iisip si Bautista. 

Pero natatakot pa rin siya kasi ayaw niya na isa sa kasamahan niya ay may galit na tinitimpi at baka maapektuhan ang trabaho lalo‚Äôt subordinate siya ng kasamahan na ito. Hindi pa kaya ni Bautista ang maipatalsik sa trabaho dahil inisiip niya na baka bumaba ang productivity level niya dahil natatakot siyang magtanong sa taong biglang may poot sa kanya.

2023-03-14 19:55:07,Text-only,Thought that I will be able to get through but nope,"For context, I posted here some time ago about having to make a change in the current system as a Fresh Grad.

I just really wanted to start my first work in a small company because I wasn't really confident with my skills when I was in a big company during my internship and was hoping that at least if I can make a change in a small company, I'll get noticed and eventually climb the ranks. I also just realized the online courses I took really helped address my weaknesses.

So, what happened is that, I entered a small company with skills I can say is above average. The problem is, with a different view of the business and an experience from a big company, I get to notice the incompetence of the people in my workplace especially in my field (marketing) and it frustrates me everyday.

The first two weeks, I was so determined to make a pitch to them to fix the system and give them a solution for their marketing problems. I was initially able to formulate a campaign but then I thought of a bigger strategy, one which is for the long term brand health based on a competitive analysis I made for them. Was eager to make a research for them to strengthen my strategy but was denied of the opportunity.

Now, I'm stuck with an incompetent management that don't plan their strategy ahead and uses mainly gut instincts. They set unreasonable deadlines since when they think of an idea, they want immediate output like ASAP and all they think about is profits. Currently I have experienced asking for permits to process within the day which is filed also that same day even if it usually takes 3 days for the proper proceds. Too much micromanagement and no particular roadmap for brand development. They just want their workers to do what they want even personal tasks like booking their plane tickets not related to the business.

I've had enough. I refuse to help a company that doean't want to adapt to change; a company that doesn't know how invest in Marketing; and a company that treats their workers as slaves with no right to voice out insights not aligned with them.

Right now, I'm just waiting for my applications to other companies and I'm ready to present my immediate resignation once I receive an offer. Don't settle for less people!

2023-10-03 17:14:43,Text-only,Help a struggling Data Scientist on Salary vs Sustainable Growth,"Main dilemma is the title. When faced between choosing high salary and further intellectual growth + sustainability, what would you pick?

I also posted this in r/phcareers for transparency. Pero for r/AntiworkPH, what I am after ay at what point can we consider work to be reformed? Is it high salary? Is it growth? Is it both? Or exploited pa rin ba kasi yung pay mo ay hindi commensurate sa revenue/value you created? If you can help me along the way, thank you. But OG text incoming:

\---

For context, I am 27, soon to marry, and graduated from two of the top universities in the country (BS and MS, pili na lang kayo alin sa big 4 hehe). I am currently working as a Data Scientist for an MNC HQ-ed in Silicon Valley, and I am earning roughly 4M annually or 300k per month gross total (as in lahat na: base, allowances, bonus, benefits etc). The job is of course aligned sa shift ng Silicon Valley, full night shift.

The 'problem' is that the job and the tasks are so boring and degrading ng talino, tipong instead of creating Machine Learning models or doing AI, gumagawa lang ako ng reports at dashboards. Worse, ako na rin nag engineering at architect ng datasets na kailangan ko kasi incompetent yung Data Engg team namin na dapat nag pproductionize nito. To add to the issue, my manager, is a self-claimed technical person pero hindi naman marunong mag model ng data. Magaling lang mamulitika which is a boon or a curse, depende on which side of the fence you sit. Pero between us, mostly sa results lang siya nakatingin. Hindi unique sakin yung ganitong approach niya, and kahit na 5 kami sa team, lahat ng tao ganito trato niya. In short, wala, hindi aligned sa job description at job title yung ginagawa ko, aka glorified Business Analyst ako, tapos yung supposed manager ko na technical at nakakaintindi sana ng Data Science, hanash niya lang na technical person siya.

I feel I'm at a crossroad where I have to pick between salary and sustainable growth. Worried ako sa future job prospects ko when shit hits the fan aka ilay-off ako or need ko na lumipat due to life circumstances, kasi Data Scientist ako dapat pero wala naman akong ginagawang ML/AI tapos ang taas na ng bayad sakin agad. I also tried applying locally and internationally. Locally, the moment they hear my current pay nag aauto-pass sila. Some interviews na nag-lie na ako na binabaan ko na and mayroon narin na I told them I am more than willing to take a 50% paycut. Internationally naman, everyone is either requiring you to have right to work in their countries, or night shift pa rin here in the Philippines-- which is not sustainable in the long run, health-wise?

Hindi pa rin factored dito na yung peers ko in local companies ay senior managers and directors na with influence in their own circles and leading their own set of people na. I guess it's nice to have that level of influence in your career. Individual contributor pa rin ako, glorified analyst level talaga ang turing sakin. I just don't know though if commensurate ba yung pay nila sa title, or if same pay lang din kami kahit hindi ako at the manager/director level pa. Some people were joking or saying na almost VP na raw kasi yung sweldo ko kaya ako nahihirapan humanap.

I guess I am just lost and hoping there's at least one person here with similar experience to mine that can provide some sort of guidance.

PS. In anticipation of questions of where I got the job plus why the salary is high, sinwerte lang po sa pag job hop at paghahanap sa LinkedIn plus tamang referrals ng mga kakilala in these companies.",0,6,0.33,Discussions üí≠,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/16ymyhs/help_a_struggling_data_scientist_on_salary_vs/,16ymyhs

2023-08-06 23:56:23,Text-only,ba't kailangan nila malaman yung current salary ko?,"Ok background lang - magaling ako sa interviews. Basta ma initial interview ako, 9 out of 10 aabot akong final interview, unless di ko na nagustuhan yung susunod nilang pinapagawa like mga forms na pina pa fill up pag agency, pag nawala na interes ko, or pag nag probe ako sa recruiter at parang nag ca cast ng wide net tapos alam ko sa sarili ko di ako bagay sa role (either masyadong over my head or masyadong mababa).

Pag tinatanong ang current salary ko, ang default answer ko is, ""I'm not comfortable discussing my current pay at this stage of the recruitment process, but I can assure you that I'm paid higher than the market average for my skills and experience."" That's an obvious bluff. Kaya nga ako maghahanap ng trabaho kasi gusto ko ng pay bump di ba?

Nung tinanong ako ang asking ko, sabi ko I'm looking at 100k a month, is that within the position's budget? Sabi ni recruiter pasok naman sa budget, may wiggle room pa daw. Yung mga sumunod na interviews, ezpz. Ready for JO discussion na daw ako, need ko lang mag fill ng documents.

So eto ako ngayon, nag fi fill out ng CompenBen form. Hinihingi nila yung actual numbers ng benefits ko. Ayoko mag lie sa current numbers ko, pero yung asking ko is 2x ng current ko kasi sa self ko I deserve that money (also gusto ko naman makatikim ng 6 digits di ba). 

For sure I can negotiate for my asking, backed up by my CV, and I'm an experienced negotiator, basta salita magaling ako dyan hahaha. Ang issue ko lang talaga is may hard evidence din na eto lang sinasahod ko and they might take that against me and offer me significantly less (anything less than 85k is sad), or worse, di na ituloy sa actual JO.

Should I play it safe or go big or go home? Raising my asking to 110k is out of the question, despite making sense (kasi baka i offer sa akin asking window ko). Di ako comfortable and I might look too greedy. I'm also taking into consideration yung bonuses, which isn't discussed yet. So kahit sabihin nating 85k pero 15k in monthly bonuses is a win for me. What do you think? 

Side note: this is 2nd of 2 offers I am mulling over. Yung isa kasi... let's just say madali silang na convince to give me what I want, kasi I'm who they need. Pero etong pinoproblema kong company is a dream company eh. Maganda siya tignan sa CV, nakakataas ng stock value.

We are Filipinos couple residing here in Ph. She has been working for 1 and a half months without being paid her compensation. It is stated in her contract that wages will be given twice a month but whenever they ask for a follow up they are usually given false promises that will always lead to another follow up. This will be her 3rd missed payroll by Friday.

What rights does she hold with this situation? It seems that the employer is delaying her wages intentionally. We assume their American counterparts are paid on time. Their managers are also clueless that they are unpaid. 

Take note they have direct contact with the owner and the owner's assistant. It seems that they are the only ones who know about this since the owner keeps delaying and mentioning he will take care of it to no avail. My girlfriend and her other fellow Filipino recruiter have managed to hit targets proposed to them. However they keep beating around the bush when it's time to send the payment via PayPal. 

She is already feeling unmotivated and would like to stop logging in for work next Monday but she's concerned that they will not give her her rightful wages if she does so. She feels trapped and is already unmotivated.

2023-01-22 11:09:21,Text-only,Company cut off all access before the offboarding process is complete,"I just requested for an immediate resignation from the company and got approved. But they cut off all access to communication channels. Is this normal? 

I was wondering how am I supposed to accomplish the entire offboarding process if they remove it before then?

Can someone please help enlighten regarding the entire process? I don't mind following instructions, if they've provided any.

Edited:

Just wanted to add a few details. I understand if it is corporate policy, but how do I accomplish and move forward with the entire offboarding process? If not, the process afterwards. 

I didn't leave the company. I sent a letter to my bosses, and got an approval. I followed all instructions the HR team provided during one of our discussions a few days ago. When I brought up my case, they were even ones to suggest the date I put on my letter. I even shared that if my immediate resignation would not be approved, I wouldn't mind taking the 30-day rendering period. 

But they actually approved it. And yet, they never provided any instructions regarding the entire process.

I didn't just leave, I didn't AWOL. The entire resignation had been properly communicated and I sought advice from the HR team. I was not properly informed. 

I don't care that the email access to the company had been cut off. I care about where the communication now will take place since it is cut off. Because at the moment, they haven't reached out.

I am really hoping if anyone can provide/shed a light regarding this process.

**
I don't understand why people here antagonize those who are leaving. I am seeking advice and information that I didn't get from the HR team. And since it was already clarified, because again, not everyone has ample IT knowledge, and they were actually sending all details in the company's account - instructions, documents to fill out, I was surprised when it was cut off. 


I was worried because if I had not seen the file (one of their checklists)  on my company's email account, I wouldn't have been able to accomplish it. I am afraid it will be used against me  - that I had failed to complete their requirements.

***
I never reached out at first because they specifically mentioned that someone will be contacting me.

Balik tayo sa intro.

Yung mga mokong na yan, walang humpay sa kakalait sakin. Ako naman, ha! Wala akong pake. Saka, maagap akong magtrabaho, kung baga, maaga pa lang, tinatapos ko na ang mga tasks, para, later on, hayahay! Oh, di ba? Diskarteng malufet na walang kasing lufet!!! BOOM! YEAH!

When I was fired my depression stops and I can finally sleep at night 

My question is 

Will my termination shows on my coe.
Will I still got backpay even I already surrendered my workstation at home. And waiting for clearance
If I find a similar job will they ask the reason or I can hide it by resigned and rendered.

Like they no longer view you as their child, sister, brother, etc but a Bank Account. I come from a well off but not rich family wherein me and my siblings were able to study on good schools, get the gadgets and items we NEED but don‚Äôt get a lot of our wants. But ever since we were young we were taught that we should study hard for our own careers so that we would not be dependent on our parents once we graduate and the money my parents saved from not giving us everything we want will be added to their retirement fund. Example of this is I only got 1 pair of shoes throughout college, bare minimum daily allowances to survive, etc.

For context I‚Äôm the youngest of my siblings and something changed from my parents when they found out I got a good job right before graduation.  To add context also with this is that my parents told me that they will no longer help me financially with anything once I graduate and should figure out life on my own, in which my other siblings were helped by my parents even at least a year before being independent. I come from a top 3 Universities in PH and luckily got a good company that gives me php 100k as my starting salary, I‚Äôm in tech btw and Im lucky enough to get something this high. 

Anyways I told my parents about the job I was offered and something changed with them rather than allowing me to live life on my own as we talked about for years, they wanted me to give them money to support them through retirement. I have no problems with helping them but They should know that I may be well off by salary but currently my bank account is literally php 0 since I haven‚Äôt even started and I have to pay for everything ( condo to stay in metro manila, furnishings, etc.). I don‚Äôt know if its the allure of money or its a reverse psychology thing with my parents telling us not to support them in our first few years but I truly feel like they view me more as an ROI at this point and I want to support them but I don‚Äôt want to enable the mindset that I‚Äôm gonna be their new source of passive income stream.

I've been working for the same BPO company for the last 9 years of my life - if you're asking bakit sobrang tagal ko nagstay, dahil first job and may tendency to look down on my skillset. I've been scouted recently by an outsourcing company and they were offering me twice sa current sahod ko; my mistake is that sobrang sa excited ko that I notified my immediate manager of my plans. After days of weighing the pros and cons of working for that company, I decided to ""look around further"" lalo na meron akong side hustle (legal assistant and the client is flexi).

I informed my immediate manager that I am not pushing through the resignation buuuut, after 2 weeks of saying so, my previous manager (kaclose ko but she jumped ship) reached out and wanted to recruit me sa kung asan s'ya ngayon - 'yung mga ""cons"" ko dun sa naunang company nabawasan all while having almost the same offer.

My start date would be sa 2nd week of the month - questions, should I render pa for 30 days or nah? Also, should I send my resignation letter na ba kahit technically wala pa akong JO?\* Thank you.

2023-05-27 12:06:16,Text-only,Struggling Engineer,"Posted this on ready2adult PH but hindi pa rin na-aapprove so I'm taking my chances here.  


First time posting here so bear with me. Please refrain from insensitive comments na lang po thank you.

A quick background: I'm a fresh graduate with a degree in Engineering (Cum Laude) from a reputable university. I failed my first take of board exams pero I passed it naman on the 2nd take, so basically one year na akong tambay and almost 3 months na rin po akong naghahanap ng work. Wala rin po akong prior work/OJT experience kasi po peak ng pandemic yung time na nagtake kami ng course for internships. Also, I'm planning to go abroad din po within 2-3 years so most likely, hindi rin ako magsstay long term sa company dito.

I need your opinion po sa pagpili ng trabaho. Nakakainggit lang po kasi yung mga classmates ko with my same capacity na nakakakuha ng hindi toxic na workplace + decent pay. I think may right time din kasi yung job hunting para makakuha talga ng mga big fish and unfortunately, na-miss ko sila since nagreview pa ulit ako for my 2nd take of boards.

Currently, for hiring na po ako sa company 1 pero medyo hesitant pa po ako because of many factors. Do you think this is the reality or am I being lowballed lalo na sa economy ngayon?

Pros:  
Very good exposure, Good company, career-wise magagamit ko talaga yung experience sa abroad in the future. Ito sana yung career path na gusto ko. Sureball na may work ako

Cons:

1. Compensation - 18k basic pay + 2k non-taxable allowance + gov't mandated benefits lang po yung makukuha ko. And ang sakit lang po isipin na anlaki-laki ng tuition ko + review center tapos ganun lang offer üì∑.

2. Work hours - (regular sched: mon-sat, 7 am - 4 pm) I think ang excessive po ng gantong schedule considering mahigpit pa sila sa time-in and time-out.

3. Work location - Nasa Mckinley West po kasi yung magiging project location ko so sobrang layo po and walang direct route para po makapunta doon unless magdala ng car. If maghahanap pa po ng titirahan, parang breakeven na lang po yung magiging salary ko since wala rin naman pong allowance for that since within Metro Manila pa rin naman po yung location.

Company 2: May 5 steps yung hiring process. Stage 1-2 is resume screening and exam. Currently nasa stage 3 na ako and interviews na lang talaga natitira for stages 3-5. Gusto ko sana i-risk yung opportunity dito and i-decline na yung offer ko sa company 1 kasi buong June yung stages 4-5. But the catch is medyo malilihis yung career path ko since sales dept. na siya, although sales engr. naman yung title.

Pros:

1. Multi-national company

2. Good pay (minimum 39k), may personal driver for site visits.

3. Although palihis sa career na gusto ko, good opportunity pa rin siya for me since gusto ko magbusiness in the future and magtake ng MBA.

4. Same city lang din siya ng residency ko so malapit lang.

5. Work sched (Mon - Fri). Hybrid setup (optimal for me).

6. Mass hiring sila and catered talaga yung opportunity for a fresh grad like me.

Cons:  
1. Madaming applicants so there's the **UNCERTAINTY** kung matatanggap ba ako.

2. Medyo off-track na sa specialization na initially planned ko i-pursue sana.

Ano po kayang mas magandang option between the two companies? Mas lenient naman ang mga first world countries sa mga fresh grad na degree holders, unlike dito sa Pilipinas, so I think I can start fresh ulit if gustuhin ko mang i-pursue talaga yung path na yon + may konting ipon na since good pay naman si company. As walang work experience kahit anong position po talaga ibigay sakin, willing ako tumanggap kasi wala pa rin po talaga akong idea sa gagawin ko sa office/site so I'm open po talaga sa career shifting.",2,7,0.67,Advice Needed ü§î,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/13sxi03/struggling_engineer/,13sxi03

2022-10-11 00:36:31,Text-only,Efforts in Vain?,"Yesterday my co-worker and I had a conversation about the progress of featuring the brands and products from company that we work in. We both find it discouraging to see our works to promoting the company's goods doesn't get  recognition much, likes, shares or hearts from targeted audiences. Although our products are quite well known at the markets and people buy them. Still, it's sad to see that all our efforts and suggestions we have compiled from last year to make the FB pages of every brands alive and the products sell were all... Well kept on the plan to do list as just part of the to list that will never have  a check mark on it. 

The only time the likes and views rise is because the post designed was boosted by the boss to be well known. They could do that but not everytime, because it costs alot to boost one advertisment post. So the boss encouraged us to keep sharing and liking.

Even tho it's  a funny and silly situation for my co-worker. Because she designed 15 post per month for each brand, and she herself share them and like them in order to promote it. I help her out too with by liking and sharing our works.. Is it like pathetic? Like you posted a profile photo and you liked it yourself just to have someone noticed it. With over 100+ employees working in the company. Not one of our co-workers or seniors seemed to like or share what we've design, I mean our advertisment posts could also help them to sell the company products more since they work to get clients.. 

It would be great if we've suggested that idea, Right?  Yes it would, but isn't it like a common sense in the marketing field and food industry that we all have a responsibility. I mean they are our seniors..? They've work longer than we are. I guess it's none of their business since they don't get paid much for that.

2022-08-26 11:38:27,Text-only,I feel like I'm being set up to fail lol,"Long story short, I'm a Financial Analyst (more like an Equity Analyst honestly), and I'm being tasked to do some reports from time to time, no biggie, fine with me.

Here's the thing with the reports that I do, if an item or project has a negative balance, it means that our counterparty made an overpayment to our company. I was tasked to ask for updates from project heads regarding these items. In my mind, why are we still asking for updates regarding these items, our concern should be the positive balances because it implies that our counterparties OWES the company money. 

Eto na ngayon ang problema, una pa lang sinasabi ko nang hindi iuupdate ng project heads yang negative balance, wala na silang pake diyan kasi nga it implies na sumobra ng payment satin. In the eyes of the project heads kasi, 'ayaw mo bang sumobra bayad satin?' (which could be due to a myriad of reasons, pwedeng may pinadagdag sa contract na late lang na update ng mga contract specialist ganyan or hindi pa nag rereflect sa system)  

So eto na! May finollow-up ako na walang update, negative balance siya, aba si project head binalikan ako na kesyo we should apply some business intelligence daw! Haha hindi ko pinatulan siyempre, pake ko ba diyan. Basta ko ginagawa ko lang trabaho na pinagawa sakin.

Ang nakakainis lang, alam na ng boss ko na may chance mangyari yung ganun, pinipilit pa din niya na gawin ko. Na alam ko sa sarili ko pag pumutok ako sa ginagawa sakin, baka patulan ko yung boss ko OR i-@ ko sa email yung boss ko at sabihin ko sakanya na 'pst apply business intelligence daw'. 

Yun lang haha. The funny thing is, I am a Fil-Am who used to work in NY as an investment analyst. I was expecting this kind of situation from Americans, but no, the people I worked with there were the nicest people I have ever met. Tapos putek dito ko pa sa pilipinas na experience yung ganun?

This is quite similar and I guess I'd like to know your opinion with this incident (dunno if this is the correct sub, but HYG):

So our manager was sick and was unable to come in to work for a week. One of my colleagues created a group chat (outside out our official work GC at syempre labas si boss) for a ""ganap"" for the sick manager.  A little something to make him feel better. Nangolekta si colleague ng pera para bumili ng ""gift"". Nataon pang father's day so parang get-well-soon/happy father's day ang pa-regalo. This kinda reminds of ganapan sa school na magko-contribute ang mga estudyante para ipanregalo kay teacher for teacher's day/valentine's/birthday/xmas party. Very Pinoy culture. 

This gives me the ick. Pwedeng-pwede mag decline but magmumukha ka naman anti-social ang going against ""office culture"".

2023-11-22 05:12:03,Text-only,"""Irereport kita kapag naulit pa""","Pa rant lang. First actual job sa warehouse staff pero on call status ako. I decided to be always moving lalo na kapag night shift para mapadali ang oras since minimum rate nga at para manatiling gising. Nalaman ko na madami pala sa workers ang natutulog lalo na kapag wala masyadong ginagawa at nagtatago sa mga boxes. As a principle never ko ginawa for the past month na pumapasok ako. 

But earlier today, I decided to hide in a couple boxes dahil nga nagkakapanic attack ako kapag masyadong malamig ang panahon. Napansin ako ng manager the first time na nag-iikot siya para magsabi kung mag-oOT o hindi. Bumalik ako sa puwesto ko. Paglipas ng ilang minuto, bumalik siya ulit at nakitang palabas ako ng puwesto ko. Sinabihan ako na ""Bakit nakahiga ka na naman ulit? Isa pa ulit at irereport kita"". Kinausap ko na nakaupo lang talaga ako sa puwesto ko at yung mga kailangang boxes sa area ko ay wala pa. At this point, master ko na ang area ko na kahit ako lang mag-isa ay kaya ko. Ayoko sabihin yung tungkol sa panic attacks ko at narinig ko na never ka dapat magmention anything mental health related sa trabaho.

Ako lang ang natitira sa apat na on-call warehouse staff na nagsimula noong September 27. Napilitan din ako magpasa ng rqmts dahil kung hindi ay hanggang isang buwan lang ang tagal namin. Nagpasok din ang manager na ito ng pinsan niya which is a no no. Ang pinsan niya ay sobrang tamad at hindi marunong magtanong kung anong gagawin. Out of the managers, siya talaga ang hindi gusto ng karamihan sa mga employees. I want to at least last a year or until na makuha ko ang CoE pero totoo talaga na kung hindi trabaho ang masama, management ang masama.

Gusto kong magtext sa manager na iyon na hindi ako papasok mamayang gabi at magsisinungaling sana ako na may interview ako. Nakakaiyamot talaga.

I think s/he might fail me sa next evals ko so hindi ko pa yun sure pero baka kasi eto lang thinking ko dahil demotivated ako? Baka naman I am performing well talaga hindi ko lang naappreciate yung work? 

For context: work is alright. Super chill as in but its the lack of interactions that demotivated me.

Questions: 
1. What should I say to my next employer? Ayoko nung work ko before?
2. If my supervisor gives a bad recommendation, will this affect my next job? 
3. Is job hopping a solution to increase my salary? I got 45k in the other companies I applied for Pero kasi hassle nung work so I settled for this one.
#4. SHOULD I RESIGN?

There was really no way of contacting them during that time so i figured i will just sign another lease agreement and  pay the rent when they contact me about it. I continued to used the space for 3 years without them demanding payment. I know it's partly my fault for not voluntarily paying the rent but now they are billing and charging me almost double for the unpaid rent for the past 3 years. Is that even legal? And even if i want to pay them I dont really have that kind of money on my bank account. I am willing to pay but i can only pay up to the principal. Can i do that and if i cant what would options be?

While this is a business and freelance ako. I get his point and sobrang professional naman talaga out of all the people I worked with. Pati manner ng criticisms nya na nappreciate ko naman talaga. Pero na feel ko that this person does not care what happens to my life as long as I provide results.

Why ko nasabi? Kasi I got issues ngayon sa laptop ko. Basically, he told me na, ‚Äúas a professional you have to own up to your problems and for example the problem with your laptop is not my problem. I know you‚Äôre letting me know about..‚Äù ganun sabi nya.

I thought tutulungan nya ko sa laptop ko lol may talk pala about sa performance ko na caught off guard ako. 

He also instructed me kung ano yung problems sa performance ko which could be done better. Naapreciate ko din ang feedback.

I felt like although again professional tone pa din sya and with respect (medyo parang awkward nga na sabihin nya sakin yung issues) I feel like any time disposable/numbers lang ako hehe. I know business pinasok ko, nagtthrive lang din talaga ako sa mas may care sa akin. Parang pampalakas loob ba. May isang client pa kasi ako e, sobrang specific sya pero laging may pep talk. Napag compare ko lang.

May ibang factors din na (mom na ko e) naririnig nya umiiyak anak ko but he doesn‚Äôt let me go sa call unless I ask pa.

Ngayon, sabi nya work close daw kami ngayon meaning we have to talk end of day para i report kung anong ginawa ko for the day.

For context lang: di kasi sya specific mag utos ng task and busy nga lagi so parang lost ako. Full time client saktong bayad naman. 1 full month pa lang ako pero parang medyo mahina na loob ko. Yung isang client ko part time lang.

How do you guys confront/address yung underperforming na staff?

We had a rush project last week ng May that should be done within a week. Pretty easy lang naman yung gagawin and at that time, called up yung staff and gave explicit instructions. Asked him if everything was clear, said ok. Tapos sabi ko rin if he has questions feel free to mesaage me. At this point experienced na sya, not a new hire. Asked him if he would prefer regular check-ins, sabi niya he will reach out na lang if need.

Edi ako, ok. Set up review time for me to review his work.

When I reviewed, grabe sobrang daming hindi natapos. We discussed what more needed to be done, what documents we need from client pa, etc. Luckily, client moved the timeline to June.

So ayun nga, I set another review last week.

Jusko halos same pa rin na halos walang natapos.

Then I asked him to upload some documents so we can ready for Manager's review. Pagtingin ko kanina wala pa rin.

Kanina I asked him what the problem was. Does he have other projects? Sabi naman wala. Do his supervisors and managers from past projects bother him to do more work? Sabi naman no. So I am now confused, WHYYYYY?????? He told me he was confused what to do. E bat hindi siya nag-reach out? Pag nagtatanong naman ako if may questions siya di naman nagsasabi. What did he do sa 40hrs/week????

Naiinis pa ako dahil offline sa Teams on working hours! I have to reach out sa Viber pa. On my part, I really don't bother if online/offline basta natatapos yung work. Pero nope. Wala naman halos nagagawa. So what is the problem??? We talked earlier kaso I'm not sure if effective ba.

I haven't been in a situation like this before, kasi nung ako naman yung staff I've never been in his situation that's why I was never on either side of the conversation.

Yung morning boss ko, sobrang okay, magaling sa work at may natututunan ako, actually sa lahat ng previous boss ko may natutunan ako kahit yung iba masungit okay lang kasi napush nila yung limits ko at naging better ako. 

Pero etong boss ko sa panggabi, hindi ko maintindihan bat sya naging boss. Hawak namin ang payroll at 5 months palang ako sa company pero kung makasita sila sakin parang naka 1 yr na ako mahigit. They expect na perfect agad yung work kahit nasa learning curve pa ako, to think na di pa established yung payroll systems nila pati sotware. Ako ang unang staff sa payroll tapos manual pa lahat kaya hindi ko gets bat nila ieexpect na okay agad lahat. 

Ang hindi ko lalo matanggap, sa 5th month evaluation ko, sinabihan ako na matagal ako magreply like ha? Fully aware kayo na may sira ang teams ko and to think na sya mismo hours bago magreply kesyo may personal issues sya tas sakin mo ipapasa? Inassume nya agad na wala ako lagi sa harap ng laptop kasi ginagawa nya rin daw, wow. Oo may ginagawa akong iba minsan pero dala ko ang laptop ko. Ang matindi pa gusto nya ako magdownload ng teams sa phone. Wtf? Lahat ng previous boss ko number one na advise sakin never magdownload ng slack or teams sa phone as boundary. 

Sobrang bagal nya kumilos, isang batch ng final pay kaya kong gawin in 2-3 hrs pero sya aabutin ng days. Manual adjustments sa payroll nagagawa ko ng 3 hrs sya aabutin ng 5-8 hrs kaya laging 7hrs OT na kaya naman ng dating manager na tapusin agad. 

Gusto nya raw ako mag volunteer pag nagtatanong yung SR. Manager sinong gagawa ng tasks. Pano ko magvvolunteer kung hindi ko pa alam lahat ng process? Sya dapat magdelegate nyan bat nya sakin ipapatake charge e ako na gumagawa ng iba nyang tasks pati pagdelegate ako parin? Bat di nalang tayo magpalit. 

Hindi sya knowledgeable sa excel, like lahat literal na manual nya ginagawa. Concat? Lookup? Pivot? Di nya kaya gawin, kaya siguro ang tagal nya kasi iniisa isa nya pa. Yung pwede sana kami makauwi ng maaga pero dahil sa kabagalan nya inaabot kami ng next day hahaha

Sinabi nya pa sa call na tinatamad syang pumasok kasi parang laging mali nalang nakikita sa payroll. Teh normal yan, kung ikaw tinatamad pano na mga under mo.

2023-07-26 12:02:44,Text-only,How to respond to a recruiter who ghosted me before,"Nag-apply ako sa isang company late last year. Pumasa ako sa technical and final interview and I really liked the people who interviewed me. Ang alam ko sila din magiging teammates ko once I join the company so I was really looking forward to it. Manager even took time from his vacation to accommodate my final interview para daw ma-process na agad yung JO ko if ever. After the final interview, very obvious na pasado na ako kasi tinatanong na nila ako if excited na ba ako mag-join, and even saying na it's up to me kung kelan gusto kong start date in case I want to take a bit of break muna before starting with them since December narin yun and parating na holidays. Manager said the recruiter will get in touch nalang with me for the next steps.

1 week later, no update from recruiter. Nag-follow-up ako, then she said na management is still discussing kasi they're still in the middle of deliberation and discussions etc. I had to press for more details, but she was vague about it. She could have said na possibly mag-freeze hiring muna sila but wala syang sinabing ganon. Sabi lang nya na hindi pa naman talaga sure na maha-hire ako. She asked for another week before she can give me daw the final decision but that was it. I never heard from her again.

Until last week... nakita ko nag-open ulit yung position na ina-applyan ko sa company nila. I was wondering if tawagan kaya nila ako ulit since mukhang pumasa naman talaga ako and mukhang nag-freeze hiring lang talaga sila. At ito na nga, nag-email na yung same recruiter who ghosted me last week asking if I'm still open to joining them. Short answer is I'm not available anymore, I've been hired by another company. Pero this recruiter's company seems good naman sana so I would be open to joining them someday kung sakaling maging open ulit ako to opportunities.

I really want to reply in the most professional way. Pero gusto ko din iparating na she could have handled it better and shouldn't have ghosted me back then. Tips please on how to keep it professional while getting that point across. Thank you!

2023-05-28 14:32:50,Image,"Boss wants me to level up, pero di ko hinahangad","Long post ahead.

Advice needed! I received this message from my boss yesterday (image attached). How do I respond to this properly? 

-----

Background: I've been working with my boss since 2019. He's from UAE, so our setup is completely remote, full-time. I'm one of the few pioneers in his company and the first designer in the team, until it eventually grew to four designers and one creative director today. 

-----

Recently I've been trying to manage my energy dahil may mga sinisimulan na akong side businesses, and I'm also developing my own brand. 

My world doesn't revolve around my full-time job anymore. Unlike before na kahit 9am pa ko nagstart magwork, kahit hanggang 12am I'm still working - dahil wala naman ako ibang ginagawa. I used to overdeliver talaga.

I have my own goals for myself now. Yes, nag-lie low ako sa full-time job ko in a way na hindi na ko nag-ooverdeliver. Wala ng overtime. Tamang trabaho na lang. Login 9am, logout 6pm. Pag may naka-assign sakin, I do it. Diba that's all that matters? Hindi ko sya pinababayaan, kasi iyun pa rin ang main source of income ko.

But I get it. I think nasanay lang sya na may pagka-bibo ako dati. Kasi ayun nga, dati kasi wala pa ko ibang pinagkakaabalahan on the side, kaya ang dami ko pang energy for work.

Also about the leadership role - I have no desire to lead. Not in his company, not for anyone. If I'm going to lead, it's for MY OWN entrepreneurial endeavors.

But as an employee (designer) - I'm the type who excels at executing design tasks, rather than taking charge and leading a team. Magaling akong gumawa, hindi gumabay.

I know most of the designers aim to be design leads, art directors, or creative directors down the line... but I just want to focus on my craft. That's what I do best.

If other team members are more capable of taking charge, then I think it would be great to let them shine. Just because I've been here the longest doesn't mean I'm capable to lead. 

Anyway, so ayun. Nag-dump lang ako ng thoughts ko muna... hindi ko pa alam ano irereply ko sa kanya. 

Anong mga kelangan kong itanong? Paano ko ieexplain side ko? Yung message nya, I feel like hindi nya kasi ako nakikitaan ng ambisyon considering na 4 years na ko sa company nya. Which is true naman - wala akong ambisyon to level up sa company nya talaga. I just do this to pay the bills, and hopefully resign in the next 3 years because this isn't what I want to do for the rest of my life.

2023-08-14 22:57:05,Text-only,Pwde ba ipaforce leave ka on a PH regular holiday kahit na bukal sa loob mo naman magtrabaho sa araw na yun?,"Long post ahead!

I am working in a relatively big BPO company, servicing other Asian countries with my teammates. The current practice in our account is to work during PH holidays since our service countries do not have holidays on those days. 

Marami ang workload namin pero pag napaghati-hatian na mas keri na. Lottery lang din workload namin per day minsan sa isang araw sandamakmak minsan onti lang. Pero kahit dun, nakakapag work-life balance parin naman kami as in no joke.

We also report to work during the holidays of our service countries, since PH is not on holiday on those days. During these days, our workload is just minimal to none. 

Problem is our new manager wanted to propose a skeletal working system during PH holidays. This means that our manager wanted some of us not to work on PH holidays, retaining at least one team member per service country as a point person of the day. Of course, this depends on the volume of work daw. 

The reasons are to increase savings within the company (since OT pay will be reduced) and promote work-life balance etc.

My teammates' and my concerns are:

1. No double pay - hindi naman sa mukhang pera kami pero any additional income is welcomed. Meron isa samin na kakapanganak palang ng asawa nya. 

We're not complaining that we need to work on PH holidays. We could manage as long as kumpleto ang members per team. Mas gusto pa nga namin magtrabaho kasi wala naman kami gagawin kung hindi kami magtatrabaho. At least dagdag pay pa.

2. Hindi ba magtataka ang service country counterparts namin bakit hindi gumagalaw ang requests nila? I think hindi ito balak sabihin ng manager namin sa head ng service country na kausap namin e. Dagdag tambak din ito sa amin since naka assign kada tao ang work.

3. Pwde ba gamitin ang VL pag pinagleave kami? Based sa labor code, entitled parin naman ang employee to 100% holiday pay kahit hindi sya nagtrabaho sa holiday.

Additional siguro for consideration: bago lang tong manager namin and before sya napunta samin, manager sya pero walang team. While discussing ito samin, di nya pinapakinggan yung concerns namin and cinucut off pa nya kami.
 
Feeling nya kasi wala kami gano ginagawa. Di man lang nya sinubukan alamin yung process namin from start to finish to see if kaya ba itong skeletal sa amin. So ditong portion palang, we feel na unfair na.

Also may kateam kami na mas matagal na sa manager namin sa company, tas never daw once ginawa ung skeletal system sa company during PH holidays.

Hope this gets approved since we're really feeling unjustified by the situation üòî first time lang din kasi namin ito maencounter so hoping for some thoughts and enlightenment.

TLDR: pwde ba kami ipaleave sa work kahit na gusto naman namin magwork dahil sa double pay? Di naman labag sa loob namin pero di naman kami pinapakinggan sa side namin.",8,5,0.78,Rant üò°,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/15qx0si/pwde_ba_ipaforce_leave_ka_on_a_ph_regular_holiday/,15qx0si

It's unlike waitering or service industry where you are with a team, you are valued (even get tips), and there is advancement in the operations and management of the service - receptionist sound challenging.

Sabi nila, mga 3 months kami pero noong nagkaproblema sa GC dahil delayed ang sahod e bigla silang nagsabi na kailangan magpasa ng requirements o hanggang 1 buwan lang kami.

As principle, ginagalingan ko para lagi akong OT. Kapag OT ako palagi ay umaabot ng 15k ang monthly ko. Most of the time, yung mga regular workers ay nagtatago sa mga boxes para matulog o magpahinga lalo na pag nightshift. Para makaiwas ako sa antok at mapabilis ang oras, DAHIL MABABA NGA ANG SAHOD, ay nagbubuffer ako ng mga boxes na tingin ko ay irerequest. Pag lumalabas sila at nakikita nila akong nagsusumipag ay sinasabihan nila na magpahinga o di kaya ay tama na iyan. KUNG PUWEDE NGA LANG AT MAS MABABA DIN SAHOD NAMIN SA INYO.

Nagkameeting kami kahapon which, thankfully counted as overtime at kailangan ko ng OT to make up dahil di kami pinag-overtime noong Tuesday dahil madami yung nagtatago at nasaktuhang nakita akong nakahiga (di ako tulog and that was the first time I rested up dahil nga in transit pa ang mga boxes). Tinanong namin sa meeting at sinabi ngang regular pay pa din kami. Yung nakakagalit ay ineexpect pa din kaming pumasok sa mga special holiday lalo na sa lunes. Gusto ko magbagal ng kilos sa lunes pero dahil nga nakasanayan ko magsipag, di ko ata magawa.

2023-09-14 15:46:06,Text-only,Problematic governance?,"I work at a diagnostic clinic in the records department. On top of the work being toxic and our department in particular being understaffed, I can already feel that our job as records personnel is severely under-appreciated. Since our clinic mostly screens people for migration, not only do we have to be meticulous in handling and updating medical records while maintaining utmost confidentiality, we also have to deal with some legal stuff. Apart from that, we facilitate the process of medical examinations from start to finish so we basically keep things running like clockwork.

Our services are pretty much client-based, and people who took their medical there can leave their reviews. Today, we received one bad review directed at our department in particular. The complaint wasn't even about their own experience but of another person they were with when they took the medical, and it's the usual kind we get because the wait can honestly be long if they passed certain documents that we send for approval to our higher-ups. So imagine our distress when we suddenly hear they'd be issuing us a corrective action request.

Something like that can not only affect our salary but our reputation as a department and as individual employees as well. The worst thing about it is the overall head of our clinic didn't even defend us. He *did* ask not to proceed with the CAR *for now*, but then he had to say that if another complaint about our department arises that's when they can issue one. Like, what the f\*ck. And we can't even defend ourselves, because we can only do so if a CAR has already been issued against us, so we'd already have an offense by then.

They distributed a memo regarding this CAR thing and they even tagged it with ""for strict compliance"". I mean, is this normal? This is my first job, after all, so I'm not sure if this is a thing in companies or if they should have held a meeting with us about it first.

So far, I'm not happy with the autocratic management here. There seems to be a lot of issues among my co-workers as well and there are only a few I get along with.

2023-08-22 02:24:05,Text-only,Hindi ba talaga possible makuha yung fair compensation-career growth-work-life balance?,"Just wondering if hindi ba talaga possible makuha yung balance between fair compensation, career growth, and work-life? 

I used to work in one of the top IT companies in the country. My career growth was really good, got promoted twice in a span of 3 years. Work-life balance is not that good tho. Need to work on weekends, may times na 25 hrs+ yung OT pag weekend. Kulang sa budget yung project sa tao kaya pag super busy nakakahiya mag SL kahit nung nagka covid ako (pure WFH naman ito). Tapos compensation is not that high pa dahil homegrown sa company. Talo ka talaga ng mga galing sa ibang companies.

6 months ago I transferred to a new company. small IT company, less than 50 employees lang. I took it because salary growth was my priority at the time and 60% increase ang offer sa‚Äôkin. Kaso sobrang unhappy ako kasi nakakamatay yung oras ng pasok, 1AM to 10AM ng tues to sat. Tapos walang career growth. Hindi ako nailagay sa project na magagamit yung skillset ko tapos di man lang ako nilagay sa business hours kaya sobrang tahimik at walang magawa. Pero mayaman ako, pero di worth it imo lalo na‚Äôt nasanay ako sa mabigat yung workload at fast-paced na work environment at gusto ko talagang madaming matutunan. Everyday 4hrs lang halos tulog ko and sobrang nagdecline talaga mental health ko.

So i just got regularized last week, pero magreresign na ulit ako. May offer na ako from one of the top IT companies din, and i accepted it na. The thing is super layo ng office and medyo may trauma pa ako ulit sa project-based companies dahil sa current work ko nga. Who knows if mapunta ako sa project na kasing stagnant din ng project ko ngayon tapos yung oras ng pasok baka nakakamatay din. My travel time would be around 3 hrs one way pa lang. But the offer is really good and desperate na akong umalis talaga.

May ongoing application pa ako with a big local company naman, in-house na yung work at fixed dayshift yung schedule. The thing is super haba ng application process. I‚Äôm done with 3/4 interviews and each stage sinasabi ng interviewers that they really like me. Kaso ang dami kong nabasang bad reviews about this company from this subreddit. Tapos being a local company, i‚Äôm not sure if kaya nila tapatan yung current salary ko (i read here na minsan mas mababa pa offer nila sa current salary mo) tapos benefits pa won‚Äôt be as good as multinational companies. Pero dito ko nahanap yung ayaw ko sa current work ko which is yung opportunity for career growth tapos pang tao na oras ng pasok.

Niyayaya ako ng old workmates ko na bumalik na lang ulit sa previous company kaso yung work-life balance naman ang mawawala lalo ngayon dahil madami kaming nag-alisan at kulang na kulang lalo sa tao.

So ayun, di ba talaga possible na makuha yung lahat ng hinahanap mo sa isang workplace lang? Just suck it up, fake it until you make it ganern?",0,1,0.5,Discussions üí≠,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/15xfnkq/hindi_ba_talaga_possible_makuha_yung_fair/,15xfnkq

2023-08-16 13:49:53,Text-only,Am I the only sales/marketing professional here struggling to find work in the Philippines?,"I gave up my real estate sales career when I got married during the pandemic. I just don't see myself meeting other people for sales calls and selling abroad, while my spouse works from home in the Philippines. Parang di sya marriage-friendly na work at all. So for my spouse, I pivoted my career to working online during the pandemic up until 2023 2nd Q. I got lucky landing an overseas company that pays a good 80-100k a month. Ang kaso biglang nagsara. Ouch.

Now I am back in the job marketplace and I'm shocked how crowded it is na. Both remote work and on-site work in the Philippines look like a queue of 50 - 100 people. My spouse and I thought of going abroad (AU or CAD) nalang, so we did a week-long research (trust me we can be really good at this research thingy). 

After a week, we were shocked at how many Pinoys risked going to Canada & AU, and are now struggling in terms of landing a job. Most of what we saw (around 90%) went abroad on student visa, and are now struggling to find work there (lasting for 1 week to 2 months, wala padin work). Not to mention, costs are PHPx36 (AU) or PHPx42 (CAD). Some of them are regretting the decision of going abroad kaso di na makauwi sa dami na ng ginastos. Now I'm half-hearted about our plans, so heto job hunt in the Philippines continues.

I am looking for work on the following sites:

‚ñ™Ô∏èUpwork
‚ñ™Ô∏èOnlineJobsPH
‚ñ™Ô∏èKalibrr
‚ñ™Ô∏èJobstreet
‚ñ™Ô∏èLinkedIn
‚ñ™Ô∏èAndami pa, di ko na maalala yung iba

I'm averaging 5-10 job applications per day for almost 1 month na and it's depressing. Modesty aside, my 11+ yrs professional background is really good, ang kaso my background is purely sales and digital marketing work during the pandemic.

My questions are:

üî∏Ô∏èWhere do you find decent-paying jobs in PH nowadays?

üî∏Ô∏èHave you tried pivoting from one career to another, if yes how was the transition and how did you land your job? Balik kaba sa entry-level talaga? :(

üî∏Ô∏èIf going abroad is a good option, what country would you recommend and why?

Im in a ‚Äúcompany name vs perks‚Äù situation and I need to have a clear decision before the day ends so I could onboard na.

- Hybrid setup (Makati, I‚Äôm from Laguna)
- Unpaid (though they‚Äôll ask pa daw if pwede nila icover pamasahe ko lol)


OPTION 2: Luxury Retail and E-commerce (Highly regarded)
- Graphic designer duties
- High chances of being absorbed either by this company or their partner luxury brands (Dior, Hermes, Marc Jacobs, etc) if I do well
- Hybrid setup (BGC)
- High chance that it‚Äôs unpaid. I never had the chance to ask pa.
- üö© Also wasnt very respectful of my time. Ghosted me on our first supposed meeting that caused me a lot of drawbacks
- Did not clear if I am offered a position. Asked for a follow up meeting today but havent heard from them pa ulit.

- The only company that respected me and my time enough :(
- With daily allowance of Php200
- Remote!!
- Not a red flag, but they asked me if I‚Äôm sure about joining them because they‚Äôre a tech company and I‚Äôm from an advertising background; might affect my career path (what are your thoughts?)

I'm gay (but on process transitioning), turning 20 this year. 

I'm a 1st yr bs psychology student, and I'm currently studying in one of the colleges in manila. I'm currently working in the bpo industry pala, and it's my 2nd company na rin then I just started last week. As of the moment, we have a month and a half to fulfill my training and my schedule is day shift (2pm to 10 pm) then night shift afterwards (after training). Then in my studies naman, I only have 3 subjects left then good to go for 2nd yr after.

For more info, our curiculum is ... ang kada semester ay devided into 3 clusters. Unlike from other universities wherein it should be devided in midterm then final term. Hindi ganon 'yung amin. Then per clusters, we're taking 3 subjects. Just a heads up as well that per cluster is can be finish for only 6 weeks. (we just started this week for 2nd sem - 3rd cluster).

My situation is, I have classes during mondays and tuesdays; 9 to 11 am, 1 to 3 pm, then 3 to 5 pm. I'll be able to attend in my first class, as well as my 2nd class since I can excuse myself naman at makaka attend ako ng class at least an hour. Anyways, we're in an online class setup pala this cluster. However, when I reached out to my prof from my 3rd class (3 to 5 pm) she's kinda inconsiderate even thought ang motto ng school is ""Working-Student Friendly."" Kaya nga ako nag-aral ulit eh, dahil sa motto nila na 'yan. Nakapag stop kasi ako ng 1 yr due to pandemic at financial difficulties. It was during the class pala and the class is about to end at that time, then it was my first break naman sa work. She instructed me to reach out na lang to her after the class through email because there's a group activity as well that I missed, and she want to do the activity ng individual. It doesn't rlly matter for me if groupings or individual thingy. I know what I can do naman. So, I write a formal letter na lang to her instead so that I can explain myself as well.

So, my problem is, since training pa lang ako sa work, bawal umabsent, isang absent is equivalent to disqualification. So, I might lost my job which is I don't to happen because even if I'm still with my parents, I'm the one who's paying my tuition. My job is my source of income. Kaya, I really can't lost my job, kasi if ever, wala naman akong pambayad ng tuition. I have issues with my family din, but I don't want to add pa 'yon. Sobrang gulo lang talaga ng situation ko. Ako lahat umaako ng expenses ko and 'yun nga, my job is my source of income. 

Balak ko kasi mag transfer sa PUP on my 2nd year, and I have to pay my 2nd sem tuition ASAP para smooth na lang 'yung transition ko from my current school to PUP. Para less gastos na rin for me.

My problem is, if ipagsasabay ko 'tong current work and study ko, I might fail this one subject (3rd class). In addition, magkakaroon pako ng problema for processing my application sa PUP. On the other side, I can still quit my current job, so that I can focus on my studies then once tapos na 'tong cluster (which is itong 2nd sem) then go back sa pag-apply sa ibang company na naman. Ang kaso naman, 'di pa fully-paid 'yung tuition ko, almost 1/2 pa ata ng 2nd sem. If I'll keep my job, mababayaran ko sya and makakapag transfer ako. Ang kaso naman, baka magka-failed subj ako since conflict nga 'yung schedule ko, edi mas lalo ako mahihirapang mag transfer.

I've been trying to sleep since I got home (it's 5:04 am now), pero hindi ako makatulog. Hindi ako makapag-isip ng maayos. 

My only choice is to stop my work muna then focus sa studies ko to secure my smooth transition sa PUP, then apply sa ibang compny after this semester since I know naman what I can offer naman as an employee. Pero kasi, sobrang ganda ng company 'ko now. Sawa na 'ko kaka ""thank you for calling..."" kasi non voice ako dito and 20,000+ php yung current salary ko. And feel ko, magagawan ko naman ng paraan 'yung unpaid tuition ko sa school. With that, masesecure ko 'yung application ko sa PUP without any hesitations. Tapos after this sacrifice, less gastos naman ako for the following year. Or else, magbabayad at magbabayad lang ako ng tuition ko until I graduated. Tapos pag hindi naman ako nag stop mag work, pag pinagsabay ko 'to sa studies ko, may conflict sched naman ako. Ending, ma ffail ko talaga yung one subject ko which is yung 3rd class. Worst case scenario, baka hindi ko ma process application ko sa PUP. 

Disclaimer: My previous clusters are all morning classes kaya I was able to attend every class. Competitive pa nga ako eh. Points na nga lang eh, deans list na. Consistent honor student ako since jhs. Marami ring extra curiccular. Hindi lang talaga ako priviledge. Hindi lang din ako nabigyan ng magandang opportunity.

Please, I really need your suggestions or opinion. Sa mga former working-student d'yan oh. Nag mamaka-awa ako. Minsan napapa-isip na lang ako if worth it pang mag-aral since kumikita naman na 'ko. Minsan naman, iniisip ko na okay lang din namang mahirapan ako ng 4 years if magiging stable naman ako in the future. Yung work anjan lang naman 'yan eh. Pero 'yung studies, we can't deny the fact na mas mahirap mag aral pag lalong tumatanda. Atsaka, gusto ko ring mag retire ng maaga no, haha.

2023-02-13 21:13:30,Text-only,Early termination ng contract,"TL; DR: I signed a contract with an agency to work as a subcontractor for a BPO company. The BPO company now wants to terminate the contract since I declined their offer for a full-time position with a really low salary.

‚Äî----

I signed a contract with ‚ÄúAgency‚Äù last year. Basically, subcontractor ako ng client nila na isang malaking BPO company (‚ÄúBPO company‚Äù). The contract is until July and I‚Äôll be working for one of the BPO company‚Äôs clients (‚ÄúClient‚Äù).

Recently, the BPO company asked me if I‚Äôm interested in getting absorbed as a full-time, regular employee. I said yes, but they didn‚Äôt tell me the exact offer at that time. Then last week I talked to the HR of BPO Company about their offer. Nagulat and na-offend ako since ang offer nila sakin is 20-22k. That‚Äôs too low considering that I‚Äôm earning more than twice right now and I already have years of experience. HR told me it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs an entry-level position daw. Obviously, I declined.

Now, my Agency just informed me that the BPO company is terminating our contract and my last day will be in March. When I asked the manager of the BPO company, they told me it‚Äôs because the Client requires that everyone in the team must be a regular employee after 6 months of service. Since I didn‚Äôt accept the regularization offer, kailangan daw i-terminate yung contract.

I find this really unfair since I signed a one-year contract, and they didn‚Äôt inform me about these details before I signed last year and during our discussions a few weeks ago. Wala ring specific clause about termination sa contract. Here‚Äôs the only thing I found on my contract:

> Employment can be terminated by the Agency upon just or authorized cause as provided by Law.

Is there anything I can do about this? Part of me wants to just let this go and focus my energy on finding a new job asap. At the same time, I want to do something (not sure kung ano) because this is unfair and they‚Äôre not complying with our contract. Also, my contract is with the Agency, not the BPO company, so baka wala ring mangyari.",4,10,0.75,Advice Needed ü§î,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/1117xmu/early_termination_ng_contract/,1117xmu

2023-10-26 11:05:49,Text-only,Modus po ba itong naranasan namin na mag-AAWOL daw sila kaoag hindi namin naibigay ang gusto nila?,"Hindi ko alam kung tama itong community and I won't gonna force you to believe me or not, ganito kasi iyon.   


May pumunta kasi saaming 3 lalake nung nakaraang linggo (mga 3 or 4 na siguro) sa bank kung saan ako nagwowork. Hinihingi nila ang assistance namin na ipasara ang business ng isang bata at teacher kilala daw nila na pasaway at masama ang ugali. Nahuli daw kasi nilang pumasok sa bank namin.  


Ang kwento nila parehas daw nitong sinigawan ang isa sa kanila which works as a church driver which happens in the year 2017(yes 2017, talaga). Yung isa naman works as a night guard, ngayon ito namang si kuya guard ang issue niya ay sa bata, is hindi raw siya pinahiram ng pera a long time ago. Alam daw niya na nagsisinungaling ang bata dahil may kaibigan itong bata sa church nila na sinabing pwdeng humiram ng pera itong si kuya guard dito sa batang nirereklamo nila. Wala raw negosyante na ganito ang pag-uugali at siya raw ang nagturo sa bata na negosyo ang sagot sa pag-asenso pero nagsisi daw siya kasi hindi niya naturo ang tamang pag-uugali at nakikita daw nila na wala ng pag-asa itong bata.  


Tapos literal ang gulo talaga nilang kausap, like si Manong Driver, habang nagtatanong kami naglalaro siya ng Candy Crush sa phone niya na naka-full blast pa, hindi naman siya sumasagot, titingin lang sa taas tapos ngingiti at kukurap-kurap. Itong kasama naman nila na isang lalake din sinabi daw niyang narinig daw niyang sinigawan ng bata itong driver na kasama nila, hindi raw niya nakita pero narinig niya. Itong si kuya guard naman paikot-ikot ang usapan namin sa kahalagahan ng pag-uugali... huwag magmaliit ng kapwa....  na sa totoo lang wala naman kaming paki-elam. Pati yung istorya ng buhay niya na nakikita na daw niya itong batang nirereklamo nila kasi yung magulang ng bata ang nagmamange ng bilyaran na pinupuntahan nila ng mga barkada niya noon at nag-aaral din siya sa private school at that time (yung mamahaling private school dito sa lugar namin) kaya alam daw niya ang ugali ng mga kabataan ngayon.   


Kaya pinalabas namin sila, telling na hindi namin kilala ang mga nirereklamo nila, syempre we practice utmost diligence sa mga depositors namin.  Itong lalake nagbanta na pahihintuin daw niya ang mga anak niya sa pag-aaral, tapos itong si security guard naman nagbanta na hindi raw siya papasok sa duty niya tapos tandaan daw namin may-asawa at anak na maliit na babae daw siyang binibuhay. Siyempre hindi namin sila pinaniwalaan kasi  ang alam namin mga troll o prank ang ginagawa nila. Ngayon may mga message kaming natatanggap kamakailan lang sa page namin na galing sa isang religous org. asking us kung ano ang ginawa namin dito sa tatlong lalake dahil nasisante daw itong si manong guard kasi nanakawan yung establishent na pinagdudutihan niya.

2023-06-17 03:34:34,Text-only,I left the company I had been so passionate about.,"(M27)  I've been on that BPO company for 3 years, outbound yung set-up and they do sales and marketing. I applied January of 2019, at sobrang bilis lang ng mga pangyayari. nag initial interview ako around 11am, tas pinabalik ako for final interview at 10pm, mag-isa lang ako ininterview nun and after passing it, pinapunta agad ako sa training room for training and after 2-3hours training, inendorse kaagad ako sa production floor üòÜ Since content writer for email brigade yung inapplyan ko, for me goods na yung ganun ka-iksi na training tas puro lang naman sample content ang pinapakita ng trainer lol.

After 2 months, nilipat ako sa ibang department as an appointment setter, something that I am not familiar and wala pang experience. But of course, tinuruan ako ng mga tenured agents and in fairness naka cope up din naman ako kaagad and was able to get commissions and incentives on top of my salary. So yun na ang naging work ko sa company until i resigned.

Maganda ang management ng operations nun though di talaga maiiwasan na merong power trippers, micro managers, sucker of praise, etc. Our Ops Manager resigned and she was replaced by a Fil-Am guy. He implemented a lot of changes especially on our incentive scheme at marami pa. Drastic changes talaga. Pero nung time na yun, hindi ko nalang iniisip since I still have our supervisor na kahit alam mong hirap na hirap na sa mga tasks because of the new management, she never missed to motivate us and she made sure na tama ang salary and commissions or incentives namin.

**Pandemic April 2020**, i was one of the lucky agents na hindi dinismiss ang contract. Sobrang takot lahat nun since di mo talaga alam kung hanggang kelan ka nalang sa company. At first, we were lucky enough to bring our equipments sa kanya kanya naming bahay, nag provide din ang company ng internet, groceries (kasama na yung mga na lay-off) at mga gamot. After 2 weeks, we received an RTO memo from our Ops Manager at pinag stay kami lahat sa isang apartment and the company provide transpo para sa pag hatid-sundo. I  think eto yung highlight ng pag stay ko sa company na yun. Thankful ako kasi di ko naranasan ang mawalan ng trabaho throughout the pandemic at nakakabili parin ako ng gusto ko.

**Post pandemic: October 2022**, my supervisor resigned and made a permanent move back to their province in Iloilo and as her fellow ilonggo, sobrang nalungkot ako nung time na yun. Since we no longer have a supervisor, my teammates and I were split up among various teams. The remaining supervisor did a draw lots system para fair ""daw"" yung distribution. So, napunta ako sa supervisor which happens to be one of the top revenue contributor sa company. At first, okay naman yung pamamalakad nya sa team and I got the support that I need during the transition. After few months, we noticed that she's already micro-managing us, lahat ng kilos namin kalkulado and worst is none of us can take a break unless we provide appointments. 

Meron din time na pinagmamayabang nya sa mga client na kaya namin yung ganito, ganyan na goal kahit di naman doable, so in the end, yung agents ang kawawa. Pero yung di ko talaga makakalimutan is yung pinahiya nya ako sa mga team mates ko... I mean, yes I made a mistake kase process naman talaga yun. Nag send ako ng calendar invite sa prospect kahit di pa na confirm or na qualify ng QA ang appointment, but eventhough ganon yung nangyari, sure ako na qualified yung appointment since the prospect already agreed to the meeting... Tas alam nyo anong ginawa? Nag send sya ng google meet link sa GC namin sa office, pinapasok kami lahat sa meeting room at dun nya ako pinagsisigaw.

 I said, ""pwede mo naman ipamukha sa akin ang mali ko na tayo lang... sa personal. Dinamay mo pa talaga ibang tao, ako lang ang may issue dito, diba? And nakita ko, vacant ang huddle room, why we can't talk about this na tayo lang?"" Pero sabi nya, para ma aware daw lahat ng team mates ko sa ganong mistake para maiwasan in the future. And I'm like, okay? Gets ko yung point pero di ko gets baket sa google meet pa ako papagalitan tas may audience pa lol tas di naman recorded.  

Sa thought pa lang na ""you can't take your breaks, unless you provide me an appointment"" madede-motivate ka na talaga, plus the micro manage at pressure. Just imagine na kailangan mo pang tumakas para lang maka yosi tas kelangan pag nag yoyosi focus ka dapat kung pano mo mauubos ang isang stick sa tatlong puff lang lol. Same goes with kung pano ka kakain (though we are allowed to bring food sa station namin pero sisitahin ka naman pag tumayo ka lol)

Ilang months ko din tiniis yung ganong style ng pag manage sa team. I was demotivated, unproductive, passive, anxiety, depression, name it. Until I came to the point na I told the HR about the ""No Appointment, No Break"" Policy ng supervisor namin.  Sinabi ko rin sa HR na gusto kong lumipat sa ibang team or department pero wala pa ring kwenta kase si supervisor parin ang masusunod. Sabi nya, ""dalawa lang ang option mo, and for the whole team... Either you work for me or you resign. I won't allow anyone of you to transfer sa ibang team."" And I was like... Na-shock ako. Meron palang ganon? I mean, stagnant ka na nga, wala ka pang chance to learn outside her team regardless of the reason. 

After couple of days, I passed my resignation via email. Actually immediate resignation yon. Ayoko naman talaga mag immediate resignation eh, di ko lang talaga kaya makipag plastikan sa supervisor namin if nag render pako. (Good thing naka hanap kaagad ako ng homebase job as Telemarketer and was able to start right away). Pri-nocess ko na rin kaagad yung exit interview ko with that company and I was able to sign all necessary docs para makuha ko ang last pay ko lol sayang din yun.

Actually, I have no regrets na umalis ako sa kumpanya na yun though at the back of my mind ""sayang"" kase okay ang sweldo tsaka malaki ang commissions and incentives. Pero nung time na yun, naging firm ako ang priority ko, and that is my mental health. 

Though until now, I still receive few offers galing sa ibang supervisors from that company pero I promised to myself na ayoko nang bumalik don. As of the moment, I have full time office job and part time VA job.",11,2,0.82,Rant üò°,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/14b5u5x/i_left_the_company_i_had_been_so_passionate_about/,14b5u5x

In my first job as a recruiter in a BPO, I recall it being sobrang dikdikan when we had to dial and call over 100 candidates each day, do regular OTs, and occasionally work on the weekends. If my memory serves me well, I worked a 29-hour shift from Friday at 10 a.m. to Saturday at 3 p.m. only to get ready for my first event.

Given that I was raised in poverty, the compensation was respectable (20,000/month), my coworkers were wonderful, and I was delighted with my work despite the role being quite demanding, Akala ko pa dun na ako magreretire,

Fortunately, I had the guts to try and search for higher compensation and better benefits when my teammates decided to resign one by one.  I finally realized you don't have to give up everything in your work. You can complete things without performing routine OTs and still have a healthy work-life balance.

Now that I'm at my third job, I have better benefits, wonderful coworkers, and productivity that is measured by output.

I hope everyone finds the balance that they're looking for, and at the same time I wish you find fulfillment in your current role.",27,0,0.83,Story üó£Ô∏è,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/y607a3/a_thank_to_you_my_employers/,y607a3

Ms A is on her break and her bag is wide open where u can see the condom sits on top of her stuff. then a male co worker ( Mr M 28 MALE )walks by and saw the condoms . he teased "" hey theres condom can i have some ?

Mr M persisted and Ms A gave him the condoms. FUCKING MR M GAVE THE CONDOMS TO THE KITCHEN STAFF AND THEY ALL LAUGHED LIKE HIGHSCHOLL KIDS THAT IS FIRST TIME SEEING A CONDOM. AND THEY FUCKING LEFT IT THERE . IN THE KITCHEN . FOR TWO FUCKING WEEKS NO ONE INITIATED TO REMOVE IT OR THROW IT OUT.

""you have a husband""

Little Rant,"I don't know if this happens as often at other more advanced countries as often as it happens here in the Philippines. But companies here managed by Older Filipino managers, majority of the time does not impose trainings and they expect you to perform just as good as the other employees who had been working there for years. Just a short story for further context.

 Had my first job, complete noob and my manager expect me to perform well. I didn't. Even though I have good credentials after graduating college, cum laude, it would not be enough to surmount that huge knowledge gap from the company. But he kept bringing my credentials up to me whenever he thinks I am underperforming. It would have been great if there was a manual or guidelines explaining how and why these processes are done or why are they there in the first place. It would have been much easier than asking someone else for help (I found out later in my experience that companies must have these manuals, guidelines and other things explaining their processes so that when no person/co-worker is capable of assisting you, you can manage it by yourself) Been with the company for six months and made major achievements for the company such as reduction of reject and wasted materials up to 0.3% consistently during my probationary period and improve output to 110%, OEE to 92%. Not excellent numbers really but good enough. The impact is felt throughout the company but the manager takes all the credit. Yet, he considers me underperforming. Because he sees that that was his achievement, not mine, he never gave me the raises nor promotion that was necessary. He just basked in the limelight all the while squeezing me every bit of output from me. Quit, resigned and the company fell down a very deep hole. As it turned out, allocations of budget had been already set in stone since the owner is seeing that we are capable of maintaining those numbers during my time. However, after my resignation, those numbers can no longer be met and thus making the company lose more money than it ever should since they moved on to take projects they can not meet and constantly being penalized for not achieving the required numbers. Manager's ego is very big. He does not want the owner to know that what kept him above the water is because of his good employees. All those experienced and good employees resigned and he was left with new employees. Never invested on them nor gave them proper care. He just squeezed numbers from them. Numbers could have been met if the manager is not too repulsive and he actually invested in his key employees. Nah, bro, he invested only on his solutions that does not work. Mind you these project charters he had been providing has no data nor basis for it. He just believes it works. Well, it doesn't, sucks for him. 

My third job, same thing and the fourth one is a different story. My fourth job is a very big company. Everything there is free including dorm rent and food. Exceptions only to hygienic products. The company as a whole is great. However, the department I was in is not. News of high attrition rate and abuse not being addressed is EXTREMELY PREVALENT in that department. HR is not doing anything to resolve that issue in that department since procurement manager and HR manager are helping each other out. There had been very talented and experienced employees that had been with the department and all of them wasted by this manager. I am not as skilled as anyone who left the company before me, however I have very specific skills that keeps me at an advantage to them. That's why they kept me in that company. Problem is, I am new to that department and don't know all the processes involved much more the idiosyncrasies of the workplace. No training done nor skim through of the processes. No manuals nor guidelines and certainly no assistance from tenured employees. Employees there are also toxic. Had to do it on my own. Luckily, I program stuff so workload that should take a tenured employee to do for hours only takes me minutes. But problem is, even though I can finish workload fast, there are things I can't do. Other departments really like me, since I was the only one who took the position who can manage the workload (I can do it since I have made work automatic). But the manager, I don't know what his problem is, always scolds me. Problems which are very vague. I ask him to clarify what is actually the problem. He gave reasons that does not make sense. From wrong formats (which does not really matter since the files I used are only for tracking things and automating stuffs. They never are submitted. He just sees what I do whenever he goes to my spot.) and not following the chronological order of doing stuff. That chronological order does not really matter as well. Well, customers call you at different times of the day. Owner sees the improvement in only two months from our department sepcifically from the task that I had been working on and added me to the Group in which the owner is also present. Manager's attitude and aggression towards me heightened even further and drove me to resignation. Funnily enough he keeps adding me to groupchats so that the owner sees that I am still in the company. 

Currently in a new Company with training. Problem is, the president, who is japanese caught wind of the culture of his company since they do not implement trainings. This pissed off the president and mandated clearly that rules set on the manuals must be followed. However, the culture of the company remained. Coworkers kept telling me nasty stuff like I was so blessed jokingly. Back then they endured things without trainings nor assistance boastfully. Even to go as far as say that they are better than me if they had trainings. 

Here's what I observed. Assistance from coworkers are great. In fact better than reading a book or manual. In my experience there are very few, sometimes they are not from my department, who assists me. However, manuals and guidelines are better in a few aspect. Since they do not get busy nor toxic. Sometimes you meet the person whom you need assistance from a specific task but would rather not divulge info because they do not like you or their ego is being stepped on. Next, Filipino managers (majority, not all) does not really know how to do their jobs well. But this is more prevalent with older managers than younger ones. If there are older managers who can do this well, I have never met one. I have only met younger managers who really do their jobs well. 

The purpose of the post is to inform some and also to discuss what best practices are possible to improve employee performance especially new hires and this is also a rant. Currently I am working with no standards nor formats. So I usually report with my own format. Scolded a few times because they do not like how it looked or formatted. Asked them how to improve. They only gave vague answers like, this is too big this is too small etc. There should be numbers not descriptions, like how big, how small etc. Next, communication. This is the first time I have been in a company where influx of information is not well circulated. Monitorings of data which you need are not saved in a single drive where accessible nor being divulged. Not because there is a policy about divulging info but because some people just don't want to divulge it to you. I really don't knowwhat their gimmick is since I asked why they are not giving it easily. I got a reply of ""Dapat matuto kang kunin yung data sa production mismo"". Bro, it is not in my job description to monitor your shit, that' your job. Monitoring of that data also takes days not just in a single day. Although there are trackers to keep things documented. That is the only time the policy of divulging info is disallowed. Since it is not my job to communicate to that department about the monitorings, they literally tell me that there are only specific named personnel to which they can share those info. Any story you can share as well regarding this and how you addressed them?",5,2,0.78,Rant üò°,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/15iytt9/lack_of_trainings_here_in_the_philippines_little/,15iytt9

2023-08-01 09:42:44,Text-only,Need advice on what to tell future employers,"I am currently hired with just 2 months in the company. After experiencing the company, I believe that my skillset is not aligned with my current job. For more context, in the job description, I will be using the tools that are familiar to me, but in reality, I'm not even using these tools. Additionally, I'm doing things that are not in scope of the job description. I have already raised this to my manager, but he seems like that he doesn't care.

To be honest, I'm looking for new jobs that are more aligned with my skillset. I don't want to waste my time on my current company by staying there for at least 1-2 years because I will not grow at all. With that, should I tell my future employer during interviews about my current situation or just be quiet about it? (example: if they ask if I'm currently employed?) If I tell my future employer about my situation right now, what I should I tell them without sounding as a red flag?

Just for more information, I don't want to resign right now with my current job because I need the money to sustain my daily needs; in short, I will only resign once I have signed a contract. To add to that, there is no penalty with my current company if I resign within my probationary period as stated in my contract.",5,5,0.73,Advice Needed ü§î,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/15eyom2/need_advice_on_what_to_tell_future_employers/,15eyom2
2023-07-31 10:01:01,Text-only,How to Report an officemate with Habitual Tardiness?,"Paano magreport ng ganito? 
May officemate kami na bago pa lang pero ganito na gawain niya. 

So background sa kanya: 
OJT namin siya dati dito sa office tapos naging ka-MU ng boss namin. Tapos nung nakagraduate nagtry mag-apply dito sa office. At dahil ""malayong tito"" niya yung head ng Admin, nakapasok siya. At dahil secret ka-MU siya ng Boss namin, dito siya inilagay sa unit namin. 

Nagstart lang siya last May. 

Nung umpisa niya ang dalas niya absent sa loob ng isang linggo. Mga 2x lang siya nakakapasok sa isang linggo. Kesyo may kasal daw na pupuntahan, etc. Madami siyang reasons. 

May time pa na naka-in siya pero maghapaon siyang wala dahil kesyo nag asikaso ng passport, nag asikaso ng BIR.

Take note, hindi lang niya once ginagawa. 

Ibig sabihin pag naka in siya.. bayad siya maghapob kahit wala siya. Kailangan lang initialan ng boss namin yung Daily Time Record then boom okay na bayad na yun. 


Hindi pa dun natatapos.. maliban sa pala absent siya. . Lagi siyang late. Ang gawain na naman niya di siya mag iin sa umaga, mag a out lang siya. 

7AM ang oras ng pasok dadating siya either ilang mins before 8 or lagpas 8. 

Sa tingin namin nasanay na siya. Kasi iinitialan naman nung Boss namin na ka-MU niya. 

Hanggang sa dumating sa point na nireport na siya sa Admin nung isang officemate namin. E yubg admin naman namin sabi ko nga e Malayong Tito niya so wala ring ginawa. Kinausap lang siya pero hindi naman siya binigyan ng kumbaga sa punishment, wala. 
 
Kinausap na yun ha so akala namin magbabago. Kaso hahaha siya na ata may problema haha hindi pa rin nagbago. Tuloy tuloy pa rin siya sa gawain niya na pag late siya di siya mag iin. 

May time halos 9 AM na siya dumating. 

Haha ang hirap katrabaho nung ganitong madaming kapit.

At oo tama ka ng hula. Gobyerno to. 
Haha ang bata pa nito pero ganito na ano pa kaya to pag tumanda. 

Nakakatawa lang ngayon mga officemates ko tuloy, chinecheck na nila palagi pag nag iin mga kasamahan namin na late. 

Haha yung bahay nitong officemate na ito ay same City ng office namin. Nakakahiya naman sa mga nakakapasok ng maaga kahit ang lalayo ng bahay. 

So ang tanong nga paano ba to ireport? 
Kasi mismong admin walang ginagawa. 

Kasi ultimo yung boss namin ay laging alte pumasok. Never nag in dahil binibigyan niya ng lagay yung isang staff ng admin para palabasin na hindi siya late. E kaya malakas loob dahil paborito siya nung pinakaboss. Dahilan ng admin: inallow ng pinakataas?

Then I told them na ""napagod po siguro ako, and siguro kailangan ko ng pahinga"".

The exec directors at this company have consistently prioritized their own interests over their employees' well-being and professional growth. The absence of training, mentoring, and guidance has created a toxic environment where you're left feeling lost and undervalued.

What's worse is the company's regressive mindset and aversion to innovation. They resist any form of change or progress, sticking to outdated practices that hinder our ability to adapt in today's fast-paced business landscape.

The company's association with questionable clients, including B/B/M/, DU/30, and Im/ee, raises serious concerns. By supporting individuals with dubious track records, the company shows a troubling disregard for ethical considerations and human rights.

As a senior employee, I'm eagerly waiting for the right time to resign and distance myself from this toxic environment. I strongly urge anyone considering joining this company to carefully evaluate their options.

But I had been asked by one of my coworkers one too many times already.

*""Kelan ba last day mo? May kapalit ka na ba?""* Last week's statement. Followed with *""may nahanap na ba sila or ikaw?""* 

I said no or none, since first of all, the job has low pay for a licensed PT like me who took a brunt job of an equivalent of a >!PT aide or a support staff (instead of treating patients or clients, this job is more of equipment procurement, maintenance, fixing the classrooms for clinical demonstrations and activities). !<

It is a noble job, thanks to my immediate supervisor, but it was my first paid job that I had to endure before I found better opportunities during the pandemic and they need my focus na. 

She replied it seems like your peers have thriving careers already and it would be difficult to find one that would replace you. In my mind, it is true, because there are only a few licensed people like me who would be up for the job if they can do the same with a bit better payment and actually be with clients to do what they studied for from 8-5 or during their desired hours pa. 

I've also shared with many people, esp my peers, that the job is not for someone who is able to do more than their job description, in which makes things harder to even recommend someone to be in this job at all. Working from 8-8, with a minimum wage >!(let's say from 11k, I became 14k, peers are 15 starting to 23k, then it goes up depending on the company policies),!< and influencing you to go overtime for better pay was appealing before. But now, it is just dragging at this point. L

After that, a week has passed and she asked again ""Kailan last day mo? May nahanap na ba sila na kapalit mo?"" was yesterday. 

That brushed me off in a way. I know with my not pakikisama ugali, and more of a professional relationship I built for the past year or so, learning r / antiwork, and r / ph antiwork that it's better to have some boundaries talaga with work environments, I guess that is a sign that they want to get rid of me na talaga din kasi I'm not with their tribe, and not tolerant with their work ethics and habits na.

Background: I have been working at the company (onsite) for a little more than 3 months, but a close family friend apparently ""referred"" me (and by referred I mean he went the extra mile to make sure I got a spot, in a way parang ipinasok nya ako) to this new company which pays more than double my current salary and is WFH/Hybrid setup. Obviously I need and want this job. The thing is, I have to start in a week or else my spot would be forfeited.

How do I tell my boss politely and honestly that I need to leave and not complete the 30day render? What good reasons should I say? 

P.S. close friend took my resume before I was hired in company 1, so it‚Äôs safe to say na inintay ko rin yung update with company 2 before deciding to push company 1. Nagkataon lang na walang updates si company 2 (until yesterday) kaya napilitan ako to go with company 1. Also, medyo nakakahiya rin tanggihan si company 2 and si friend na rin kasi he went above and beyond to make sure I get a spot. 

P.P.S. My current employment contract does say that I have to render the 30day notice to resign, but it didn‚Äôt say what will happen if I don‚Äôt. It did not specify any bond or any penalty should I fail to render.  I also don‚Äôt mind being tagged as terminated since secured naman na yung spot ko with company 2, and this is a long term career na and hopefully retirement company ko na rin. I already have the JO and a definite start date, all I need is to sign it.

Currently, I am working in this international company pero Independent Contractor role, meaning, walang benefits, HMO, etc. Lumipat ako dito dahil sa full remote setup. Disclaimer lang di ako dollar rate kundi PHP rate pa din.

Several months ago I applied for the position, I would say entry level yung role kaya nga entry level salary din yung inoffer sakin pero nakipag negotiate ako stating how my experiences are relevant to the role, then binigay naman expected salary ko. Last month, sinama ako sa training program para mag transition to the next senior role with a promise of salary adjustment syempre. After I completed the training, the manager sent a message to me saying na yung current rate ko daw ay in line with expectations already based on my scope so the appraisal will have to wait until the 1 year mark. 

How do I respond to this correctly? Initially, I plan to negotiate pa din for salary adjustment and if di talaga nila ibibigay, I would rather reject the promotion and stay with my current role. Nabasa ko na yung common advices in the thread similar sa ganitong situation which is to accept the promotion, add the role to your resume and apply sa iba. Pero ang dilemma ko kasi eh unusual naman tong trabaho ko and nag check din ako wala naman ako mahanap na pwedeng malipatan na similar role, and sobrang importante din sakin kasi na full remote setup. 

Also, in my mind, if I reject the promotion, it might give a bad impression sa company, and bilang isang contractor baka maka apekto yun na di na i-renew yung contract ko.

Matagal na rin nafeel ng intuition ko that something was off with the company. Siya rin 50/50 raw feel niya doon. Nainis ako sinayang oras namen.

To make the long story short, I submitted a notice of resignation to my current employer kasi nakahanap ako ng better opportunity in a completely different field. Due to financial reasons, I badly need the new job and it would greatly help me. Plus, the career-path is good and better for my growth in the long term.

My problem is, nakapirma ako ng tatlong taong kontrata sa current work ko na kung aalisan ko this month, may matitira pang 12 months na hindi ko matatapos. Hindi nila ako pinapayagan mag-resign at nilagyan din nila ng clause yung COE ko na mayroon akong legally binding na contract na after a year pa mag-eexpire. Red flag na agad dun sa new employer ko kung isu-submit ko. Which is part din ng requirements.

Sabi ko sa kanila tuloy pa rin yung resignation ko at kung gusto nila ako pagbayarin, mag-file sila ng dispute sa NLRC. Ayoko rin kasing bayaran yung natitirang 1 year sa contract ko kasi parang hindi naman siya reasonable. Hindi naman nila ako binigyan ng kahit anong training o nag-invest sila sa akin. Hindi rin ako binayaran ng kahit anong advance. Basta nakasaad lang sa contract na kapag pumirma ako, matic nakatali ako sa kanila at anytime na i-breach ko yung contract, babayaran ko yung matitirang buwan. Ang mali ko lang, dapat hindi ko pinirmahan yung kontrata in the first place kaso sobrang desperado kasi ako noong mga time na yun.

Ngayon, pinagsstart naman na rin ako ng new employer ko kahit hindi pa ako nakakapagpasa ng COE. Junior role lang din pala yung inaapplyan ko at malayo yung experience ko from my previous job dito sa new role na inapplyan ko. Kung alam ko lang na magkakaganito, hindi ko na sana nilagay yung experience sa resume ko. >.<

Hirap na hirap na kasi ako financially sa current work ko. Wala growth. Walang increase. Grabe yung workload. Nakakalungkot lang na after ng 6 yrs ng pagtatrabaho ko sa kanila ng maayos, pinipigilan pa nila ako lumipat at umunlad.

4 onsite - 1 WFH
8AM-5PM (but I work 7AM-6PM because of the workload)
Wear four hats
Has great engagement activities and growth opportunities 
Generous bonuses, HMO, 40k monthly

My only issue is the workload and my boss na mahilig magmando na di naman nagtuturo. Siguro personality ko na ang mag-step up but I just don‚Äôt feel safe around the presence of my boss. Yung tipong fear lang nararamdaman ko. I‚Äôm a Gen Z pero recently confirmed with my millennial workmates na talagang may attitude problem si boss at di lang siguro ako snowflake (?)

Some instances:
1. Kung ayaw daw namin sa kaniya, kami ang umalis kasi never siyang magre-resign.
2. Ang hirap magpaalam ng leave. May isang beses ka-work ko ginrant ng clinic namin na magpahinga for 1 week pero nagalit siya kesyo ubo lang naman daw. 
3. May times na utang na loob pa ang feeling kapag sumasagot siya ng queries on leave, weekend, non-office hours.
4. Di siya marunong magkontrol ng boses nya na ultimo lahat sa floor rinig na rinig kpag may pinapagalitan siya.
5. May power tripping tendencies din. Like may presentation tapos magcu-cut-off siya without allowing the person to finish speaking.
6. Mahilig siya mag-utos even sa mga middle managers na kunan sya ng kape, and the likes etc etc.

On the other hand:
1. Di naman siya physically abusive or nagmumura. 
2. May times na okay naman siya as a  mentoring.

1. This application is thru referral so sabi sakin nung friend ko, maganda naman raw feed back sakin ng manager during the final interview and sabi may tiwala raw sya sakin (sabi nung manager) 
-so bakit hiring sya?

To start, I come from a well-off background and hindi kami salat sa pera. However, my parents are really strict on money din kaya I never got the change to experience the huge allowances that most of my peers at the same socioeconomic standing has. I am not complaining naman as I understand my parents‚Äô intentions to teach me about money. 

However, I got into an accident where I accidentally wrecked a classmate‚Äôs laptop (Macbook na medyo recent model) and I did not want to ask for my parents‚Äô help since it is my fault naman. Kaya lang, in order to pay for repairs and sa abala, I had to shell out close to 45k for the repairs. I took out several small personal loans to pay for it as I cannot apply for a larger amount that banks offer as I am not employed yet. Yun lang, some of these lending institutions charged high interests. I have paid around 25% of these but I am still around 35k in the hole. 

This made me think that I might need to apply for a job (part time or full time) to pay for these loans and to save money din. My educational background naman is nice and I come from one of the most prestigious unis here in the PH. Any advice on how to get hired and what to do once I get job offers?

More than half a decade on this profession (won't disclose, but will give a clue - anti dox measure), walang salary increase, contractual, walang benefits, ""no work, no pay"". Expected ng management ang 100% performance. Max hours of work, 10 hours a day. Unsyamado ang salary increase, because yada, yada and all other bullshit excuses.

Maganda performance mo? Mamanmanan ka lalo ""para hindi daw maligaw ng landas"". No rewards on good performance, tapos puro ""OThankYou"" - sige, expected na kasama sa propesyon na ito, na maski sa bahay, nagtatrabaho ka pa rin. Tanggap ko yun. Naka-off ako, need umattend ng meeting, tapos dahil off mo, wala kang sasahurin kahit umattend ka. Hindi ka umattend sa outside work activities, le-label-an ka as walang pakikisama, mukhang pera. Umusbong anxiety ko sa mga yan, like, halos lahat ng gawin mo, may masasabi at may masasabi. Lahat, panghihimasukan. Ipaglaban mo karapatan mo, turing sayo, subersibo - iinit ang mata sayo. Subpar, unconducive facilities for work: ""Gawaan mo ng paraan."" Tapang pa ng management na magmalaki na may papalit sa amin kapag nagresign kami, at magpasalamat na lang daw kami kasi may trabaho kami.

May mga aktibidades na labas sa sinumpaang trabaho mo pero within organization like consultancy, pero walang honorarium, dahil may nagreklamo sa honorarium na kung tutuusin ay napakaliit na nga - sub-500, if you'll ask. Laging pabor sa mga kliyente ang management - reklamo ng kliyente, papakinggan, gagawaan ng paraan. Pero sa management, bilang empleyado ka nila, wala kang karapatan sa sukli ng pinaghirapan mo. Late sahod kapag natapat ng weekend or Monday, since hindi sila nagpapasahod ng Monday for some reason.

Pagod na ako. Though masaya ako sa ginagawa ko, galit ako sa ginagawa ng management at sa sistema.

EDIT: For the context, sahod is averaging on 16K a month. Worst is 10K kapag puro holiday. Best is 19K, pero tambak at halos nasakripisyo na health ko. Varying salary were due to ""no work, no pay"", and whatever additional pay you get, sa meds lang napupunta in return dala ng sakit na lalala due to additional workload rin. Workload were directly proportional sa salary na makukuha mo. For you to get that 19K, you need to work for around 45 hours a week.

2023-08-11 20:56:14,Text-only,Village Administrator,"Maintenance and guard were drinking late night while they were off duty. Maintenance driving the e bike outside village premises. No license but maybe that's allowed under PH Law and he was drunk. While guard who he was with while drinking was his passenger. Nabangga nawasak yun e bike. E bike is owned by the village. 

Administrator being newly hired. Decided to punish both of them. Guard with one month suspension. Maintenance with one week suspension. 

Guard is an OIC. Maintenance one tier level lang sila. Administrator asked the Board of Directors to sign the punishment he wanted implemented for them. 

As an innocent bystander privy to this, I feel like this was an unfair punishment. The difference between a week and a month is large. I know that Admin designed it that way for selfish reasons because they will have a hard time without the Maintenance while the guard can easily be replaced by the agency the village is in contract with.  The Admin will be affected directly without the Maintenance. 

I just wanted to ask your opinions before I say something if I am right in my assessment that the punishment is not fair. Cause if you were drunk driving without a license, I don't think you'll get off easily, however this is an e bike which does not require a license. and can be driven in public roads. VS The drunk passenger who did not caused the damage to the e bike and whatever it was they bumped into. Cause he was merely sitting on his drunk ass. Or was it because he is an OIC that's why he had more accountability hence the heavier punish",1,2,0.67,Story üó£Ô∏è,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/15o87fr/village_administrator/,15o87fr

Hello, I'm a fresh grad and got hired last Thursday, June 6. I was offered 20k as my monthly basic salary and the only allowance is medicine allowance of 750 pesos per year. Payday is every 8th and 23rd of the month. So, my first salary will be on 23rd. 

Would like to ask lang po how much po kaya ang dapat kong sahurin on the 23rd? As well as the amount of salary deduction for my contribution? Dapat ko po bang makuha nang buo yung kalahati ng basic pay ko na 10k every cutoff? Sorry, newbie pa lang po.

Nagulat lang sila na agad agad na pala ako magpapasa that time. Plus, tapos ko na rin dapat clearance ko sakanila, nakumpoleto ko naman.

Set a meeting w/ employer > process yung exit documents > done

Hindi po ba dapat naprocess na po ni company yung exit documents ko after 30 days ko magresign?

So now, hired na ko sa 2nd company ko. Well, need ng COE and ITR sabi ko na lang na if pwedeng to follow na lang siya kasi kelangan pa mag set ng f2f meeting with previous employer bago nila iprocess yung documents ko na yon. Pumayag naman si current HR

Sabi na lang ng iba kong friends na sana makalimutan na lang ni Current employer ko na ifollow up yung coe & itr ko from previous. Okay lang ba yun? Ano po kaya pwedeng mangyari if hindi ako nagpasa both documents?

And late ko na narealize na sana pala hindi ko na lang ininclude yung previous company ko sa resume kung pahirapan naman pala iprocess mga exit documents sakanila.

Nakapasa sa isang company and told me I was ""chosen"" for the position of EA. Unang una palang super gulo ng POC (Person of Contact from HR) na kausap ko via text message. Napaka inconsistent pagdating sa communication, isang tanong isang sagot, nag tatagalog, nag tataglish, and then biglang isang formal na english kapag nag memessage.

After akong tawagan, nag send agad siya ng lists of pre-hiring requirements to comply without a JO or any details/process na gagawin. Talagang ""here's the list of requirements, go! Pakicomply na!"" POC consistently emphasized na ""ALL"" the requirements should be sent to a particular person from HR sa office. Asked for the JO first via text message, sent me a basic salary na makukuha without including any compensation and benefits na I had to ask too para lang malaman ko, tapos sinabi lang ""your job position will under..."". Tapos. Kahit na naiinis ako the way the HR handle my inquiries, nag comply pa rin ako, due to pressure from the family bakit wala pa akong work, and the wants na magkapera na since competitive naman ang salary. 

Completed all the requirements within a week (of course some are to be follow, being a student), including the pre-employment medical na inendorsed nila sa isang clinic so all the results will be send to the company directly. To add also, kinukulit na ako kung kailan ako mag iistart. Suddenly, sabi nung POC na ang isusubmit lang sa HR na tinutukoy niya ay isang specific requirements lang (PDS), the rest of the requirements will be sent to the POC email scanned copy. Inis na inis na ako kasi una palang consistently niyang sinabi na i-submit ko lahat ng requirements sa specific HR na sinasabi niya. Tapos biglang isang requirements lang pala ang kailangang i-submit personally doon sa HR, at the rest scanned copy nalang. Gustong gusto ko na i-withdraw yung application ko kaso nakapag pa medical na ako and the result will be sent to the company directly without me having a copy.

I know uso naman talaga ang mga sipsip pero tangina garapalan talaga na kahit dedma ka lang, pansin na pansin mo!!!

Anyways, panapanahon lang naman yan. I am just here to rant anyway. Kayo ba guys share nyo naman ung experience nyo sa mga tanginang sipsip nyong workmate ;)",1,4,0.67,Rant üò°,https://www.reddit.com//r/AntiworkPH/comments/13hfeux/ranking/,13hfeux
