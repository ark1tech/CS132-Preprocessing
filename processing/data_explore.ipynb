just so people are<br>covered in case they are planning to<br>resign adding a line or two as well<br>about health concerns as a cause for<br>immediate resignations so lately ive<br>been seeing some posts on this sub about<br>what happens if you choose to go absent<br>without leave or file for immediate<br>resignation for whatever reason thought<br>of writing this simple guide for<br>everyone on the implications and next<br>steps should you decide on passing your<br>immediate resignation for whatever<br>reason first why file for immediate<br>resignation as the name implies<br>immediate resignation is the voluntary<br>resignation of an employee with<br>immediate effect however one cannot<br>simply pass their immediate resignation<br>and expect it to be valid without them<br>incurring liabilities to their employer<br>for your immediate resignation to be<br>valid your reasons must indicate just<br>causes as the labor code provides<br>actually if you have just causes you do<br>not need to submit a resignation letter<br>second what are just causes for<br>immediate resignation according to the<br>labor code these are just causes for<br>your immediate resignation serious<br>insult to the honor and person of the<br>employee inhuman and unbearable<br>treatment accorded the employee by the<br>employer or his representative crime<br>committed against the person of the<br>employee or any immediate members of the<br>employees family other similar causes<br>you have been cheated by your employer<br>you can resign immediately there are<br>libelous statements made by your<br>employer against you you can resign<br>immediately your employer locked you in<br>the office via padlock resign that job<br>you can no longer stand you have another<br>opportunity cant wait you were insulted<br>that your salary is low just wait you<br>cant resign right away give your days<br>notice first so you dont have to hang<br>anything if you dont have just causes<br>but you really cant stand it anymore and<br>you file an immediate resignation the<br>employer can consider you as absent<br>without leave which can be grounds for<br>abandonment third whats absent without<br>leave and abandonment as the name<br>implies its being absent from work<br>without properly filing for a leave it<br>can be just one instance or habitual<br>instances of being absent from work<br>without following company guidelines<br>abandonment a failure to report to work<br>or absence without valid or justifiable<br>reasons there must be a clear intention<br>to sever the relationship with the<br>employer absent without leave and<br>abandonment while absent without leave<br>is not automatically abandonment since<br>going absent without leave just means<br>that you do not followed the company<br>policy for being absent it can lead to<br>abandonment if you really intend to<br>leave your employer being terminated for<br>going absent without leave is also<br>different from being terminated for<br>abandonment fourth what are the<br>implications if youre tagged for<br>abandonment okay the burden to prove<br>that you abandoned your job falls on the<br>employer however they can consider you<br>terminated if theyre able to prove that<br>you did in fact abandon your post<br>termination is not an easy  er though as<br>the employer also needs to do their due<br>diligence and afford you due process<br>fifth how can an employer terminate you<br>for abandonment as evidence of<br>abandonment for an employer to terminate<br>you the employer must attempt to contact<br>you several times through different<br>mediums such as your personal and work<br>emails contact number and last known<br>physical address if you do not respond<br>to any of these and the employer has<br>documented him the next step is to<br>formally provide you with a notice to<br>explain an administrative hearing and if<br>you still do not show up your notice of<br>termination lastly what are the<br>implications if you are terminated for<br>abandonment like any other instances<br>where an employee was terminated for<br>neglect of duty or other issues like<br>harassment you do not have separation<br>pay the employer will just release it<br>and but the record is also not good if<br>your future potential employer conducts<br>a thorough background check while your<br>file is sealed and considered<br>confidential information by your<br>previous employer it doesnt mean that<br>the human resource of your previous<br>employer will not reveal your reasons or<br>lack thereof for leaving during a<br>background check you can opt not to<br>include the previous employer in your cv<br>when applying for a new job but again<br>your future potential employer can find<br>out about your stint in your previous<br>company when checking your sss etc<br>records there are instances as well that<br>an employer can seek damages depending<br>on your contract especially if there are<br>provisions regarding breach of contract<br>ive seen a few contracts where employers<br>stipulate damages that are worth figures<br>but this is an extreme case if just<br>causes for immediate resignation best to<br>render at least days still or negotiate<br>a shorter window with your employer but<br>what about health concerns are they<br>valid for immediate resignation however<br>this doesnt mean that health reasons are<br>strictly invalid the same goes for<br>mental health concerns proper<br>documentation is crucial note that there<br>might be a bit of negotiation required<br>here as well since not all employers<br>will be willing to bend the day notice<br>period as required by law in this case<br>proper documentation of your health<br>reasons and a plan to facilitate the<br>proper turnover and clearances will be<br>crucial here in short health reasons for<br>immediate resignation are on a<br>casetocase basis edit what are the<br>implications for a regular employee vs a<br>probationary employee okay so if you are<br>a regular employee all the provisions<br>stated above apply however if you are a<br>probationary employee and you decide to<br>resign immediately without just causes<br>here are possible scenarios that can<br>apply to you employer will still require<br>you to render days as prescribed by law<br>just so you can finish work and do your<br>proper turnover and clearances employer<br>can offer to negotiate a shorter window<br>for your notice period if theyre kind<br>lol if you are stubborn in your<br>immediate resignation without just<br>causes the employer can consider your<br>status as not regularized due to<br>abandonment meaning you did not pass the<br>probationary period as you left this<br>would still require a paper trail though<br>such as the employer trying to contact<br>you through several mediums",

          "a guide on immediate resignations absent<br>without leave and abandonment reposting<br>this guide that i posted on the other<br>sub figured that it might come in handy<br>for antiworkph just so people are<br>covered in case they are planning to<br>resign adding a line or two as well<br>about health concerns as a cause for<br>immediate resignations so lately ive<br>been seeing some posts on this sub about<br>what happens if you choose to go absent<br>without leave or file for immediate<br>resignation for whatever reason thought<br>of writing this simple guide for<br>everyone on the implications and next<br>steps should you decide on passing your<br>immediate resignation for whatever<br>reason first why file for immediate<br>resignation as the name implies<br>immediate resignation is the voluntary<br>resignation of an employee with<br>immediate effect however one cannot<br>simply pass their immediate resignation<br>and expect it to be valid without them<br>incurring liabilities to their employer<br>for your immediate resignation to be<br>valid your reasons must indicate just<br>causes as the labor code provides<br>actually if you have just causes you do<br>not need to submit a resignation letter<br>second what are just causes for<br>immediate resignation according to the<br>labor code these are just causes for<br>your immediate resignation serious<br>insult to the honor and person of the<br>employee inhuman and unbearable<br>treatment accorded the employee by the<br>employer or his representative crime<br>committed against the person of the<br>employee or any immediate members of the<br>employees family other similar causes<br>you have been cheated by your employer<br>you can resign immediately there are<br>libelous statements made by your<br>employer against you you can resign<br>immediately your employer locked you in<br>the office via padlock resign that job<br>you can no longer stand you have another<br>opportunity cant wait you were insulted<br>that your salary is low just wait you<br>cant resign right away give your days<br>notice first so you dont have to hang<br>anything if you dont have just causes<br>but you really cant stand it anymore and<br>you file an immediate resignation the<br>employer can consider you as absent<br>without leave which can be grounds for<br>abandonment third whats absent without<br>leave and abandonment as the name<br>implies its being absent from work<br>without properly filing for a leave it<br>can be just one instance or habitual<br>instances of being absent from work<br>without following company guidelines<br>abandonment a failure to report to work<br>or absence without valid or justifiable<br>reasons there must be a clear intention<br>to sever the relationship with the<br>employer absent without leave and<br>abandonment while absent without leave<br>is not automatically abandonment since<br>going absent without leave just means<br>that you do not followed the company<br>policy for being absent it can lead to<br>abandonment if you really intend to<br>leave your employer being terminated for<br>going absent without leave is also<br>different from being terminated for<br>abandonment fourth what are the<br>implications if youre tagged for<br>abandonment okay the burden to prove<br>that you abandoned your job falls on the<br>employer however they can consider you<br>terminated if theyre able to prove that<br>you did in fact abandon your post<br>termination is not an easy  er though as<br>the employer also needs to do their due<br>diligence and afford you due process<br>fifth how can an employer terminate you<br>for abandonment as evidence of<br>abandonment for an employer to terminate<br>you the employer must attempt to contact<br>you several times through different<br>mediums such as your personal and work<br>emails contact number and last known<br>physical address if you do not respond<br>to any of these and the employer has<br>documented him the next step is to<br>formally provide you with a notice to<br>explain an administrative hearing and if<br>you still do not show up your notice of<br>termination lastly what are the<br>implications if you are terminated for<br>abandonment like any other instances<br>where an employee was terminated for<br>neglect of duty or other issues like<br>harassment you do not have separation<br>pay the employer will just release it<br>and but the record is also not good if<br>your future potential employer conducts<br>a thorough background check while your<br>file is sealed and considered<br>confidential information by your<br>previous employer it doesnt mean that<br>the human resource of your previous<br>employer will not reveal your reasons or<br>lack thereof for leaving during a<br>background check you can opt not to<br>include the previous employer in your cv<br>when applying for a new job but again<br>your future potential employer can find<br>out about your stint in your previous<br>company when checking your sss etc<br>records there are instances as well that<br>an employer can seek damages depending<br>on your contract especially if there are<br>provisions regarding breach of contract<br>ive seen a few contracts where employers<br>stipulate damages that are worth figures<br>but this is an extreme case if just<br>causes for immediate resignation best to<br>render at least days still or negotiate<br>a shorter window with your employer but<br>what about health concerns are they<br>valid for immediate resignation however<br>this doesnt mean that health reasons are<br>strictly invalid the same goes for<br>mental health concerns proper<br>documentation is crucial note that there<br>might be a bit of negotiation required<br>here as well since not all employers<br>will be willing to bend the day notice<br>period as required by law in this case<br>proper documentation of your health<br>reasons and a plan to facilitate the<br>proper turnover

well as for my<br>experience with company and the<br>management they dont deserve to be part<br>of this great place to work why my bad<br>experience with the company let me start<br>the whole story before being part of<br>this company i was working for a small<br>business process outsourcing company<br>along mandaluyong well the great thing<br>about this small business process<br>outsourcing na i joined before is their<br>compensation package unlike other<br>companies around it the management and<br>the bosses and their politics here are<br>people the only reason i have to give up<br>my career with them is because i cant<br>handle it and my salary is still<br>insufficient for my cost of living in<br>mandaluyong and what i give to my family<br>in the province somewhere in the south<br>by the way the technical account i hold<br>for our business process outsourcing and<br>because of the lack of it and often it<br>is still short because the salary i<br>realize is small it turns out that its<br>hard to tell the cost of my living vs my<br>salary take note im not condo living or<br>what but my expenses are expensive i<br>decided to look for a closer job and be<br>able to go home im with you to save<br>money instead of paying for my rental im<br>excluded from renting my bills for<br>electricity water and internet good<br>compensation package x of my salary in<br>business process outsourcing to<br>mandaluyong the offer made me very happy<br>at that time because the person above<br>listened to my request to find a job<br>nearby with a good salary and most of<br>all it was based on my experience as a<br>technical support this is when i was<br>hired by our company and i was able to<br>resign with the previous company this is<br>where my bad experience began the first<br>bad experience stated in the job posting<br>was technical support only to find out<br>that it was not a tech account to a<br>sales account and hard selling pushy<br>sale too much its not important if you<br>can solve the concern of your cx its<br>more important if you can sell the<br>products and services you upsell i have<br>nothing against this kind of things but<br>i wish they would be honest in their job<br>posting and just put it sales account<br>for tech program is not the one that<br>still has a technical account you dont<br>care if it can be resolved or not as<br>long as the cx can be sold then when you<br>sell poorly you are automatically<br>terminated i remember when we went into<br>production to call us of the tenured<br>agents welcome to hell its really hell<br>if you dont have sales youll be<br>pressured to sell and youre really a<br>shame for the whole team their key<br>performance index is sales which is the<br>largest chunk so if you dont pass that<br>theres no goodbye you really have a job<br>no matter what youre good at making<br>calls or what because thats not what<br>they need what they need is someone who<br>is good at selling even if the quality<br>of the call is worthless and even if you<br>cant help cx youre in trouble me and my<br>friends who are with me we can see at<br>the entrance of the office we were<br>already sick and we went home because we<br>knew that it was really hell because of<br>the hardships people really hurt me and<br>even in my previous company they knew<br>how to hurt me and i am super thankful<br>to the previous company y because they<br>understand me in the part of the village<br>here the ones in the new company dont<br>care if you die they dont care its not<br>valid to get sick here my experience<br>here was terrible imagine i got the flu<br>to the point that my body got chills and<br>then i just said goodbye i hope to be<br>able to request even a human resource<br>rest from the clinic to my team leader i<br>have no intention of sending home even<br>for a little rest because i really cant<br>take my human resource lunch so i just<br>slept and rested but i really cant do it<br>did accla say whats more important is<br>your hr rest oh that it will be your<br>lost hour impacting not only for you but<br>for the whole team no robot cant rest<br>cant be sick even though i have a bad<br>flu i let him in then hr rest is not<br>acceptable and because the team leader<br>was condescending about it i endured it<br>not until one time when i really couldnt<br>take it anymore my sign was that it was<br>going to be my last shift even though my<br>flu was getting worse i was willing to<br>get to work because its my last shift<br>and im just looking forward to my rest<br>day my flu has become severe i cant move<br>my body properly anymore i feel pain all<br>over my body and i feel like im disabled<br>so i did a checkup right away only to<br>find it turns out that there is<br>something serious in my body that caused<br>me to have the flu and i wont disclose<br>the whole medical thingy to the point<br>that i need to undergo major surgery for<br>it in my situation the team leader is<br>more important than what i lose sales<br>and lost hours instead of the life and<br>death situation im dealing with is so<br>bad it makes me cry just imagine if i<br>had checked up earlier and been given<br>the chance to rest i would have taken<br>care of it but because of their<br>selfishness and the whole management i<br>didnt focus my health and then the<br>ending they will determine me because i<br>am unfit for work due to my health<br>conditions and the procedure i underwent<br>did i want it if i could just distribute<br>that pain i gave it to you to include my<br>pain and you will experience it its been<br>hard this time i dont know if you can<br>handle what ive gone through in our<br>company its draining me emotionally and<br>mentally from what im going through in<br>my personal life and then at work ive<br>had a lot of bad experiences here in our<br>company that i dont have iinclude what<br>our company pays is not worth it for the<br>stress they give you i am not a<br>reprimanded worker i worked well but why<br>do i need to experience these things<br>self is teaching us to be compassionate<br>and empathetic towards our customer but<br>you yourself are in management and<br>higher op you cant do it to your agents<br>well the world goes round what comes<br>around goes around you are everything<br>you did wrong to your worker and the<br>return and for the record you dont<br>deserve to be included in the great<br>place to work because you dont know how<br>to treat those who worked for you<br>correctly with the many cases you have<br>in the national labor relations<br>commission of unjustified termination i<br>dont know how you still get into the<br>criteria that is best place to work if<br>your management and work environment is<br>like that i

          "great place to work hello everyone i<br>just need to get this of my chest to<br>move forward so i was working for this<br>company which is part of great place to<br>work in the philippines well as for my<br>experience with company and the<br>management they dont deserve to be part<br>of this great place to work why my bad<br>experience with the company let me start<br>the whole story before being part of<br>this company i was working for a small<br>business process outsourcing company<br>along mandaluyong well the great thing<br>about this small business process<br>outsourcing na i joined before is their<br>compensation package unlike other<br>companies around it the management and<br>the bosses and their politics here are<br>people the only reason i have to give up<br>my career with them is because i cant<br>handle it and my salary is still<br>insufficient for my cost of living in<br>mandaluyong and what i give to my family<br>in the province somewhere in the south<br>by the way the technical account i hold<br>for our business process outsourcing and<br>because of the lack of it and often it<br>is still short because the salary i<br>realize is small it turns out that its<br>hard to tell the cost of my living vs my<br>salary take note im not condo living or<br>what but my expenses are expensive i<br>decided to look for a closer job and be<br>able to go home im with you to save<br>money instead of paying for my rental im<br>excluded from renting my bills for<br>electricity water and internet good<br>compensation package x of my salary in<br>business process outsourcing to<br>mandaluyong the offer made me very happy<br>at that time because the person above<br>listened to my request to find a job<br>nearby with a good salary and most of<br>all it was based on my experience as a<br>technical support this is when i was<br>hired by our company and i was able to<br>resign with the previous company this is<br>where my bad experience began the first<br>bad experience stated in the job posting<br>was technical support only to find out<br>that it was not a tech account to a<br>sales account and hard selling pushy<br>sale too much its not important if you<br>can solve the concern of your cx its<br>more important if you can sell the<br>products and services you upsell i have<br>nothing against this kind of things but<br>i wish they would be honest in their job<br>posting and just put it sales account<br>for tech program is not the one that<br>still has a technical account you dont<br>care if it can be resolved or not as<br>long as the cx can be sold then when you<br>sell poorly you are automatically<br>terminated i remember when we went into<br>production to call us of the tenured<br>agents welcome to hell its really hell<br>if you dont have sales youll be<br>pressured to sell and youre really a<br>shame for the whole team their key<br>performance index is sales which is the<br>largest chunk so if you dont pass that<br>theres no goodbye you really have a job<br>no matter what youre good at making<br>calls or what because thats not what<br>they need what they need is someone who<br>is good at selling even if the quality<br>of the call is worthless and even if you<br>cant help cx youre in trouble me and my<br>friends who are with me we can see at<br>the entrance of the office we were<br>already sick and we went home because we<br>knew that it was really hell because of<br>the hardships people really hurt me and<br>even in my previous company they knew<br>how to hurt me and i am super thankful<br>to the previous company y because they<br>understand me in the part of the village<br>here the ones in the new company dont<br>care if you die they dont care its not<br>valid to get sick here my experience<br>here was terrible imagine i got the flu<br>to the point that my body got chills and<br>then i just said goodbye i hope to be<br>able to request even a human resource<br>rest from the clinic to my team leader i<br>have no intention of sending home even<br>for a little rest because i really cant<br>take my human resource lunch so i just<br>slept and rested but i really cant do it<br>did accla say whats more important is<br>your hr rest oh that it will be your<br>lost hour impacting not only for you but<br>for the whole team no robot cant rest<br>cant be sick even though i have a bad<br>flu i let him in then hr rest is not<br>acceptable and because the team leader<br>was condescending about it i endured it<br>not until one time when i really couldnt<br>take it anymore my sign was that it was<br>going to be my last shift even though my<br>flu was getting worse i was willing to<br>get to work because its my last shift<br>and im just looking forward to my rest<br>day my flu has become severe i cant move<br>my body properly anymore i feel pain all<br>over my body and i feel like im disabled<br>so i did a checkup right away only to<br>find it turns out that there is<br>something serious in my body that caused<br>me to have the flu and i wont disclose<br>the whole medical thingy to the point<br>that i need to undergo major surgery for<br>it in my situation the team leader is<br>more important than what i lose sales<br>and lost hours instead of the life and<br>death situation im dealing with is so<br>bad it makes me cry just imagine if i<br>had checked up earlier and been given<br>the chance to rest i would have taken<br>care of it but because of their<br>selfishness and the whole management i<br>didnt focus my health and then the<br>ending they will determine me because i<br>am unfit for work due to my health<br>conditions and the procedure i underwent<br>did i want it if i could just distribute<br>that pain i gave it to you to include my<br>pain and you will experience it its been<br>hard this time i dont know if you can<br>handle what ive gone through in our<br>company its draining me emotionally and<br>mentally from what im going through

time was am i was<br>there and exactly am i was spoken to by<br>the guard and stayed in their meeting<br>room ill be honest their building is not<br>good its old because the aura of the<br>place is like a place that can be used<br>for shooting horror films the only good<br>thing is the coldness of their air<br>conditioner after a few minutes their<br>human resource came and took me through<br>assessments and i filled out some forms<br>in the exam as well if i remember<br>correctly when i got to nn he took me to<br>lunch first then just summarized the<br>exam by pm the person who will be<br>interviewing me which is the human<br>resource head will pm me later as usual<br>take note that the human resource head<br>is the son of the owner of the company<br>so it is understandable that he is late<br>for school is that really the case when<br>the son of the owner or you owner you<br>have the authority to be late i said to<br>myself i can only wait for one hour and<br>i dont want to go back its a waste of<br>time because of the fare still nothing<br>of course and i invested an hour of<br>waiting i still waited i was updated by<br>the human resource again saying that the<br>human resource head will be late but he<br>informed me that there is an interview<br>scheduled there is still nothing ish<br>then the person decided it was the human<br>resource who was going to do the initial<br>interview with me but what was annoying<br>was that he immediately said that my<br>asking salary was not in their budget<br>thats why i actually went to the company<br>to see if the offer to me was bigger<br>compared to a company that has already<br>given me a job offer but the human<br>resource found out that the salary was a<br>big factor in my decision i wish he<br>didnt wait for me to be interviewed by<br>the human resource head but because i<br>was very patient to the point that i<br>looked like a fool i waited for hours i<br>said to myself that this is the last<br>time if there is no one i will go home<br>but when i should have gone home maybe<br>it will be six months then i was called<br>for an interview by the human resource<br>head so i went and he said he wanted to<br>because you see im serious about the job<br>because i waited for a long time so i<br>smile smile ahahaha even though i want<br>to hit him he still says he wants me too<br>because he says im committed because ill<br>be a bro my family said that i am the<br>eadwinner at the point that he said that<br>i am sure that i am sure that i do not<br>want to work with them as a piglet as<br>the eldest son and thats how he thinks i<br>will die if he decides too much so i<br>wont mention that other things that were<br>discussed but the bottom line is that my<br>asking salary is too much and this is<br>all they can give he said i should wait<br>a few minutes and he will get back to me<br>he said he will interview me because his<br>sister who is the chief executive<br>officer of their company is me because<br>it was just a few minutes ago one of<br>their employees informed me that they<br>said they would have to wait a few<br>minutes because the ceo would still be<br>eating which i said could it be done<br>tomorrow because those pms even though i<br>will never come back if they agree to it<br>as i said the employee said that he<br>informed the ceo that some people<br>entered the room to interview me he is<br>part of the board of directors but he is<br>not the ceo buy time it seems like he<br>only asked me two questions then he told<br>me i didnt need that he talked about his<br>life and how difficult the position i<br>was applying for he said he had<br>experience because that was as long as<br>it took minutes for him to lecture me<br>yes i just said yes because i have to be<br>polite hahaha even though i really<br>wanted to go home because they said<br>after a few minutes passed the human<br>resource head came and informed me that<br>it was really good did they tell me that<br>the position i am applying for is<br>already occupied they are looking for<br>someone with at least years of<br>experience i wish they had told me from<br>the beginning so that i didnt waste my<br>whole day with them right although they<br>said they have an open position to be<br>the personal assistant of the chief<br>executive officer they convinced i said<br>that its beautiful inside me you know<br>thats not the job i want it was also<br>mentioned by the human resource head<br>that im a good fit because im especially<br>patient and the sister is a<br>perfectionist and no thank you i dont<br>want to the ending is that i didnt get<br>anything i came home to us mages pm more<br>than enough almost human resources were<br>eaten for nothing i still really cringe<br>every time i remember my cursed but they<br>or i hope their dishes arent always<br>delicious its annoying because the<br>update is now pm the human resource head<br>of the company reached out to me<br>inviting me again for an interview in<br>december whats more annoying is<br>receiving no response at all or<br>rejecting me saying that i have found a<br>much better company

           "ghosting why it happens and how to cope<br>prelude before anything else please<br>gather some confidence to read this ill<br>tell you i cant help myself not filter<br>what really happens in the background as<br>the recruiter by the way this is a<br>longpost thus the prelude introduction<br>ive been seeing a lot of posts about<br>being ghosted by a recruiter be it they<br>didnt call back after signing a job<br>offer no calls after the<br>technicalorinitial interview or worst no<br>call at all yes i know it sucks to be<br>treated that way i personally been in<br>your situation when starting my career<br>and even during my early job hopping<br>experience guess what i didnt dwell on<br>it nor asked what company is it for me<br>to avoid it i applied and they were even<br>the ones chasing me yes the people<br>company you hated were the ones chasing<br>me so whats the difference between you<br>and me and please all of these are<br>hypothetical so if it hits you and you<br>get triggered sleep on it first so youd<br>comprehend why does ghosting happen when<br>you apply what happens is that a<br>recruiter will read your cv then check<br>on available job posts for a crossmatch<br>even if you did it yourself they might<br>reach out and call you to get some<br>details so its up to you what you can<br>disclose basically your profile gets<br>deprioritized and simply put rejected i<br>know and completely understand you want<br>to hear the rejection from them but if<br>you received a failed response and your<br>peers with identical skill sets as you<br>knew they wont apply there anymore so<br>why is your profile getting<br>deprioritized theres only one reason why<br>theres someone better than you or better<br>put theres someone else who can do the<br>job without much training needed despite<br>the salary requirements now you would<br>tell me i need a job and i cant build<br>that experience without a job so how can<br>i compete you upskill yourself its today<br>and most skill literature is shared on<br>youtube tiktok etc so instead of mopping<br>around you got rejected or coping with<br>the rejection by playing games and being<br>unproductive by the way just gives more<br>reason not to hire you you need to<br>discipline yourself to match the job<br>youre the one asking for the job right<br>so know whats needed to get the job my<br>personal experience as an applicant when<br>i started this is my personal experience<br>when i started looking for a job nope<br>not the present when most jobs cant<br>afford to hire me ive applied to a<br>hundred jobs or basically run a shotgun<br>to what jobs are available with the<br>keyword of the only initially<br>interviewed me then only proceed to a<br>technical interview and only made a job<br>offer as for the postings who ghosted me<br>i didnt care to ask why oh i did<br>experience a dry spell wherein all<br>applications turned interviews whats the<br>reason for giving me the offer it was<br>simply i was the right man for the job<br>and ironically i was one ghosting those<br>job offers why for the same reason i<br>deprioritized them all for a company<br>that values ​​my skills and career<br>growth my personal experience as a<br>recruiter ive been a recruiter for years<br>been an it programmer for years before<br>retiring so handling + cvs a day while<br>meeting the target key performance<br>indices and only having hours to scheme<br>them all just imagine how many cvs are<br>left unread and ghosted look am not<br>proud of it even am sharing it see the<br>picture and yes when i got the chance to<br>catch up there are good applicants that<br>id missed as they already have taken a<br>job add in my hourly limit as a<br>recruiter for just hours a week as i<br>need to run hours on the main job its<br>hard to read all cvs and interview them<br>which by the way takes hours for a<br>skills interview you get the picture my<br>proposal to combat ghosting since am i<br>became a parttime recruiter and a<br>programmer i programmed an application<br>tracking system or hris for that agency<br>yes we still encode the data and all but<br>all recruiters were able to keep a track<br>of all applicants and whats their status<br>we even sent an email notification only<br>for rejection but the best part we get<br>scolded by the hiring manager because he<br>gets notified that this applicant has<br>been left in the for initial interview<br>after days did that help in my<br>perspective yes then again not all<br>recruitment agency has the same budget<br>for one nor have a centralized way to<br>storeupdate applicant status how should<br>you cope the answer is simple you submit<br>your application but dont expect a reply<br>treat your application as done and<br>rejected i know thats kinda doing<br>reverse psychology to yourself but it<br>helps change your mindset from chasing<br>the company to letting the company chase<br>you and the same applies to every step<br>of your application and what if there is<br>no one interviewing you then you need to<br>upskill ive said it before your current<br>skills arent a match or better yet<br>theres someone better than you and more<br>qualified so start investing in your<br>skills how to deal with<br>recruiterscompanies who are known to a<br>ghosts actually nothing just hit apply<br>like you didnt apply and if they called<br>you good but dont expect any again this<br>is the let them chase you mindset and<br>not you chasing the company why need to<br>change your mindset its simple to value<br>your worth and am going to touch a bit<br>about lowballing most applicants who get<br>a verbal offer intuitively accept the<br>offer before reviewing it and when they<br>post here to review they get dumbfounded<br>that its a low salary for that position<br>and it pains to see their excited faces<br>turn to frustration thats you chasing<br>the company mindset now if you start the<br>let the company chase you and they gave<br>you an offer below your accepting rate<br>you can decline youd be surprised that<br>there will be offers that will give in<br>to your asking salary considering you<br>really are worth the rate and with the<br>prices going up due to inflation and all<br>well now you know",

hear me out this post is<br>too long i hopped on a quick call<br>yesterday when i said quick call it was<br>insanely fast a grillgrinding interview<br>​ so my scheduled time was am<br>philippines time i woke up at around and<br>proceeded to set everything up from my<br>laptop to the lighting ​ at around i<br>joined the zoom link and entered the pin<br>boom it was all black i mean i didnt<br>turn my camera on lol so i checked the<br>link directly and yes it was all correct<br>at am s joined in which means i joined<br>first and she came in next she said good<br>morning and thank you for hopping on<br>this preliminary interview with  im the<br>executive hiring specialist ill be<br>shadowing this preliminary interview a<br>talent specialist will join us as well ​<br>yes you read it right  sounds like<br>highly intelligent knowledge right<br>laughing out loud but i had some<br>research on my sleeve i did my company<br>research which i think makes me more<br>highly intelligent than them lol ​ after<br>a while came in the talent specialist<br>and greeted us they asked my consent to<br>record the  meeting which i gave then<br>asked me ​ can you briefly tell me more<br>about yourself ​ i answered ​ ​ how do<br>you create seo content ​ this question<br>got me thinking ​ so i answered ​ well i<br>usually follow a certain checklist to<br>create content whether its about an seo<br>article or writing seofriendly articles<br>to briefly walk you through i need to<br>ask my clients for the content brief<br>from there i draw lines on what needs to<br>be done and what needs to be<br>accomplished first like keyword research<br>and of course after everything is<br>written i need to get my clients<br>approval plus i put that on the system<br>that my client intends me to use one<br>example is wordpress she then answered<br>alright what made you apply for this<br>role as a marketing content writer<br>actually before i answer that let me<br>shed light on this so youd know where im<br>coming from and we could meet in between<br>i never optedin applying for the<br>position ​ i received a message from<br>your cofounding chief executive officer<br>on linkedin and he invited me for a<br>quick call which i religiously accepted<br>​ so it piqued my interest to attend<br>this quick call and i never expected<br>that its going to be a panel of<br>interviews pardon my line of answering i<br>mean we just need to be friendly calm<br>and jive here right ​ we proceeded to<br>the next question ​ can you walk me<br>through how you write content ​ ​ the<br>last question is ​ how much salary do<br>you expect from us ​ that depends<br>actually because i need to use certain<br>parameters like the length of time and<br>work rendered fulltime and parttime and<br>from that i can draw a ballpark figure<br>around k pesos per month ​ but hear me<br>out ​ as a freelance copywriter the<br>value and conversions i bring to the<br>table are three times greater than my<br>monthly salary ​ say one article costs $<br>and one case study project costs $ which<br>is what i expect however please do not<br>worry as this is merely my expectation<br>ultimately i am focused on<br>implementation and action j she seemed<br>content with my response and asked if i<br>had any questions to which i<br>respectfully obliged thank you actually<br>i have three questions two for you and<br>one for is that okay sure firstly what<br>is the unique selling proposition of<br>hikinex thanks next what values ​​can<br>you impart to me as an aspiring<br>candidate for the marketing content<br>writing position ​ she answered and<br>explained doing her best to provide<br>comprehensive responses ​ which i<br>completely understand i replied ​ she<br>then exclaimed oh p you really put me on<br>hot sit there ​ its alright i noticed<br>that you were doing your best and i<br>appreciate it ​ thank you ​ let me now<br>ask s a question ​ as the executive<br>recruiter of hikinex how do you counter<br>negative social proof comments and<br>reviews online + suspension notices<br>about your company ​ simply put we<br>ignore them as long as they do not<br>impact us also to answer your previous<br>question about the values ​​we impart to<br>aspiring candidates just be yourself we<br>do not micromanage ​ i understand s<br>thanks for that ​ i then delivered my<br>sales closing message thanking them for<br>taking the call with me and wishing them<br>luck with their future recruitment<br>activity ​ they said that they would<br>provide feedback within the week after<br>forwarding the recording to the hiring<br>manager ​ side note i started with an<br>end in mind ​ as a freelancer let us<br>avoid the mindset that we are business<br>employees we are business partners which<br>makes a significant difference ​<br>whatever the results may be i will not<br>proceed with the hiring process because<br>i noticed some red flags there are<br>plenty of them but i will not list them<br>down ps this is my personal experience<br>so exercise your own diligence if you<br>wish to work with them what do you think<br>guys did i grillgrind them laughing out<br>loud",

post for more than<br>a year and honestly i want to fucking<br>leave im looking for someone to move to<br>it just so happens that i cant pass<br>since im still waiting on a good offer<br>the bills aint paying themselves and my<br>family doesnt have generational wealth<br>for me to resign without a new job it<br>used to be okay tbh i really do not like<br>taking calls i freaking hate what i do<br>but for experience and to keep myself<br>afloat i took the offer because when i<br>was looking for jobs this was the only<br>one that accepted me and my managers<br>were kind during my interview i couldnt<br>afford to buy any longer so i took the<br>risk and accepted the offer even though<br>it was too low when the basic one was<br>only able to make up for it because the<br>bank had good benefits but even so we<br>were so underpaid we were open even<br>though there were no international<br>clients too much then the shifting<br>schedule was still naggy thats me so i<br>know that the gy shift is unnecessary<br>because its legit that only a few pieces<br>are calling and the clients concerns can<br>wait until the morning and then they<br>added am to pm and pm to am before its<br>difficult to file leaves if there are<br>any youre with someone who cant come in<br>they have to look for someone to cover<br>that persons shift then theres also a<br>policy that if youre not working you<br>have to work on a rest day to make up<br>for it like i said were not business<br>process outsourcing but it feels like<br>that not entirely sure if this is also<br>the case with business process<br>outsourcing so dont come for me before<br>it ended they hired this new officer he<br>hasnt been in yet the wind is starting<br>to change there are so many changes in<br>the house rules that there is so much no<br>sense in the clean desk policy but the<br>officers have a lot of things on the<br>table those who have pedestals are not<br>allowed to be kept from them only<br>officers can do overtime every fucking<br>week the speed is fast but its annoying<br>to take leave and sl we have a target<br>because we have to meet at least answer<br>level every day so that we can pass the<br>end of the month what can we do we dont<br>have agents overall in one day we havent<br>made any calls how can we get the<br>desired one if we lack people overtime<br>is their answer even though we are all<br>tired in one day its not really possible<br>that the banks clients are increasing<br>but we are still like that they are<br>hiring but only one at a time how is the<br>bottom of the offer you only accept it<br>if you are very desperate to earn money<br>like me i was dazzled because there we<br>were laughing out loud loud but still<br>not enough i am writing this post<br>because i feel so bad i suddenly threw<br>up yesterday and i really dont know why<br>because im fine before coming to work we<br>have this break sched that we strictly<br>have to follow because if not iccrucify<br>they are just joking so my shift<br>yesterday was from am to pm my lunch was<br>at pm before i heated my food i had to<br>do number so i already knew something<br>was off then suddenly i lost my appetite<br>it could have been because of something<br>i sister but i didnt eat anything that<br>was foreign to me after forcing myself<br>to finish my baon i went to the comfort<br>room and threw up everything i ate i<br>immediately advised my team leader that<br>im not okay and if its possible to um i<br>just went home first he told me to go to<br>the clinic first and ask for meds so i<br>did and the doctor said reflux so they<br>gave me meds for that i went back to the<br>cr and i vomited again and number it was<br>much worse this time i took the medicine<br>after doing my thing and messaged my<br>team leader again telling him that i<br>really cant do it anymore when i got<br>back to my station i didnt do it right<br>away because i was waiting for them to<br>tell me if i was going home was it me or<br>not they were interviewing someone thats<br>why it took so long so i was irritated i<br>called first because i had a very bad<br>trip because its not my fault that i<br>suddenly vomited its not my fault that i<br>feel bad i rarely take absences even<br>when i was a student because there was<br>no reason for me to be absent when i was<br>gs and hs i always had perfect<br>attendance as in a school year i was not<br>absent unless i really needed to come to<br>work on time but for them it was late<br>because it should be at least minutes<br>before during your shift you are there i<br>am working on it i always go in even<br>though i am a little not okay i go back<br>after their interview my team leader<br>replied that i had gone to the clinic it<br>was crazy then i was told to rest first<br>then i will come back after an hour i<br>said ill just be patient because what<br>time is it but they insisted that i stop<br>making calls first since they were<br>already asking approval from the new<br>annoying boss if they could send me home<br>so i was there in the back of the office<br>resting after minutes the person came<br>team leader and they are sending me home<br>because they said i might not be able to<br>come in today they are concerned about<br>the al because the weekend is so<br>critical the al is more important than<br>my health okay okay so i didnt beat<br>myself up i went back to my station and<br>logged out and i went home with a bad<br>look when our inbound head thought you<br>killed me but when they were the ones<br>who were not okay they just twitched and<br>left immediately fucking bullshit so i<br>booked my move it and while on the way i<br>got sick again i said its a good thing i<br>went home i couldnt handle him when i<br>got home it was a complete disaster then<br>i started getting mild fever and i felt<br>really awful i didnt want to eat<br>anything because i lost my appetite and<br>im sure ill just throw up all the<br>gatorade water only porridge and<br>medicine my stomach said that it was<br>last night that i might not be able to<br>go in because i still feel really bad<br>and ill observe first if i can go in the<br>next day which is today i woke up around<br>am and vomited as for me when i checked<br>my phone my team leader replied and it<br>seemed like it was my fault that i wasnt<br>okay thats why i was allowed to go home<br>yesterday so i could come in today its<br>only my health that i have the right not<br>to go in even though im rd tom until<br>monday so i really cant go in where else<br>are my sick leave credits for decoration<br>bitch i can just send them a picture of<br>my vomit ill end it here if you made it<br>this far thanks for taking the time to<br>read i really hope i can find a better<br>offer so that i can slap their faces<br>with my resignation they will trash<br>their attitudes there is no<br>consideration for their employees we are<br>the ones who live in that unit well my<br>team leader replied and still wants to<br>give me a half day to help al",

like a place that can be used<br>for shooting horror films the only good<br>thing is the coldness of their air<br>conditioner after a few minutes their<br>human resource came and took me through<br>assessments and i filled out some forms<br>in the exam as well if i remember<br>correctly when i got to nn he took me to<br>lunch first then just summarized the<br>exam by pm the person who will be<br>interviewing me which is the human<br>resource head will pm me later as usual<br>take note that the human resource head<br>is the son of the owner of the company<br>so it is understandable that he is late<br>for school is that really the case when<br>the son of the owner or you owner you<br>have the authority to be late i said to<br>myself i can only wait for one hour and<br>i dont want to go back its a waste of<br>time because of the fare still nothing<br>of course and i invested an hour of<br>waiting i still waited i was updated by<br>the human resource again saying that the<br>human resource head will be late but he<br>informed me that there is an interview<br>scheduled there is still nothing ish<br>then the person decided it was the human<br>resource who was going to do the initial<br>interview with me but what was annoying<br>was that he immediately said that my<br>asking salary was not in their budget<br>thats why i actually went to the company<br>to see if the offer to me was bigger<br>compared to a company that has already<br>given me a job offer but the human<br>resource found out that the salary was a<br>big factor in my decision i wish he<br>didnt wait for me to be interviewed by<br>the human resource head but because i<br>was very patient to the point that i<br>looked like a fool i waited for hours i<br>said to myself that this is the last<br>time if there is no one i will go home<br>but when i should have gone home maybe<br>it will be six months then i was called<br>for an interview by the human resource<br>head so i went and he said he wanted to<br>because you see im serious about the job<br>because i waited for a long time so i<br>smile smile ahahaha even though i want<br>to hit him he still says he wants me too<br>because he says im committed because ill<br>be a bro my family said that i am the<br>eadwinner at the point that he said that<br>i am sure that i am sure that i do not<br>want to work with them as a piglet as<br>the eldest son and thats how he thinks i<br>will die if he decides too much so i<br>wont mention that other things that were<br>discussed but the bottom line is that my<br>asking salary is too much and this is<br>all they can give he said i should wait<br>a few minutes and he will get back to me<br>he said he will interview me because his<br>sister who is the chief executive<br>officer of their company is me because<br>it was just a few minutes ago one of<br>their employees informed me that they<br>said they would have to wait a few<br>minutes because the ceo would still be<br>eating

people<br>entered the room to interview me he is<br>part of the board of directors but he is<br>not the ceo buy time it seems like he<br>only asked me two questions then he told<br>me i didnt need that he talked about his<br>life and how difficult the position i<br>was applying for he said he had<br>experience because that was as long as<br>it took minutes for him to lecture me<br>yes i just said yes because i have to be<br>polite hahaha even though i really<br>wanted to go home because they said<br>after a few minutes passed the human<br>resource head came and informed me that<br>it was really good did they tell me that<br>the position i am applying for is<br>already occupied they are looking for<br>someone with at least years of<br>experience i wish they had told me from<br>the beginning so that i didnt waste my<br>whole day with them right although they<br>said they have an open position to be<br>the personal assistant of the chief<br>executive officer they convinced i said<br>that its beautiful inside me you know<br>thats not the job i want it was also<br>mentioned by the human resource head<br>that im a good fit because im especially<br>patient and the sister is a<br>perfectionist and no thank you i dont<br>want to the ending is that i didnt get<br>anything i came home to us mages pm more<br>than enough almost human resources were<br>eaten for nothing i still

crossmatch<br>even if you did it yourself they might<br>reach out and call you to get some<br>details so its up to you what you can<br>disclose basically your profile gets<br>deprioritized and simply put rejected i<br>know and completely understand you want<br>to hear the rejection from them but if<br>you received a failed response and your<br>peers with identical skill sets as you<br>knew they wont apply there anymore so<br>why is your profile getting<br>deprioritized theres only one reason why<br>theres someone better than you or better<br>put theres someone else who can do the<br>job without much training needed despite<br>the salary requirements now you would<br>tell me i need a job and i cant build<br>that experience without a job so how can<br>i compete you upskill yourself its today<br>and most skill literature is shared on<br>youtube tiktok etc so instead of mopping<br>around you got rejected or coping with<br>the rejection by playing games and being<br>unproductive by the way just gives more<br>reason not to hire you you need to<br>discipline yourself to match the job<br>youre the one asking for the job right<br>so know whats needed to get the job my<br>personal experience as an applicant when<br>i started this is my personal experience<br>when i started looking for a job nope<br>not the present when most jobs cant<br>afford to hire me ive applied to a<br>hundred jobs or basically run a shotgun<br>to what jobs are available with the<br>keyword of the only initially<br>interviewed me then only proceed to a<br>technical interview and only made a job<br>offer as for the postings who ghosted me<br>i didnt care to ask why oh i did<br>experience a dry spell wherein all<br>applications turned interviews whats the<br>reason for giving me the offer it was<br>simply i was the right man for the job<br>and ironically i was one ghosting those<br>job offers why for the same reason i<br>deprioritized them all for a company<br>that values ​​my skills and career<br>growth my personal experience as a<br>recruiter ive been a recruiter for years<br>been an it programmer for years before<br>retiring so handling + cvs a day while<br>meeting the target key performance<br>indices and only having hours to scheme<br>them all just imagine how many cvs are<br>left unread and ghosted look am not<br>proud of it even am sharing it see the<br>picture and yes when i got the chance to<br>catch up there are good applicants that<br>id missed as they already have taken a<br>job add in my hourly limit as a<br>recruiter for just hours a week as i<br>need to run hours on the main job its<br>hard to read all cvs and interview them<br>which by the way takes hours for a<br>skills interview you get the picture my<br>proposal to combat ghosting since am i<br>became a parttime recruiter and a<br>programmer i programmed an application<br>tracking system or hris for that agency<br>yes we still encode the data and all but<br>all recruiters were able to keep a track<br>of all applicants and whats their status<br>we even sent an email notification only<br>for rejection but the best part we get<br>scolded by the hiring manager because he<br>gets notified that this applicant has<br>been left in the for initial interview<br>after days did that help in my<br>perspective yes then again not all<br>recruitment agency has the same budget<br>for one nor have a centralized way to<br>storeupdate applicant status how should<br>you cope the answer is simple you submit<br>your application but dont expect a reply<br>treat your application as done and<br>rejected i know thats kinda doing<br>reverse psychology to yourself but it<br>helps change your mindset from chasing<br>the company to letting the company chase<br>you and the same applies to every step<br>of your application and what if there is<br>no one interviewing you then you need to<br>upskill ive said it before your current<br>skills arent a match or better yet<br>theres someone better than you and more<br>qualified so start investing in your<br>skills how to deal with<br>recruiterscompanies who are known to a<br>ghosts actually nothing just hit apply<br>like you didnt apply and if they called<br>you good but dont expect any again this<br>is the let them chase you mindset and<br>not you chasing the company why need to<br>change your mindset its simple to value<br>your worth and am going to touch a bit<br>about lowballing most applicants who get<br>a verbal offer intuitively accept the<br>offer before reviewing it and when they<br>post here to review they get dumbfounded<br>that its a low salary for that position<br>and it pains to see their excited faces<br>turn to frustration thats you chasing<br>the company mindset now if you start the<br>let the company chase you and they gave<br>you an offer below your accepting rate<br>you can decline youd be surprised that<br>there will be offers that will give in<br>to your asking salary considering you<br>really are worth the rate and with the<br>prices going up due to inflation and all<br>well now you know",

hear me out this post is<br>too long i hopped on a quick call<br>yesterday when i said quick call it was<br>insanely fast a grillgrinding interview<br>​ so my scheduled time was am<br>philippines time i woke up at around and<br>proceeded to set everything up from my<br>laptop to the lighting ​ at around i<br>joined the zoom link and entered the pin<br>boom it was all black i mean i didnt<br>turn my camera on lol so i checked the<br>link directly and yes it was all correct<br>at am s joined in which means i joined<br>first and she came in next she said good<br>morning and thank you for hopping on<br>this preliminary interview with  im the<br>executive hiring specialist ill be<br>shadowing this preliminary interview a<br>talent specialist will join us as well ​<br>yes you read it right  sounds like<br>highly intelligent knowledge right<br>laughing out loud but i had some<br>research on my sleeve i did my company<br>research which i think makes me more<br>highly intelligent than them lol ​ after<br>a while came in the talent specialist<br>and greeted us they asked my consent to<br>record the  meeting which i gave then<br>asked me ​ can you briefly tell me more<br>about yourself ​ i answered ​ ​ how do<br>you create seo content ​ this question<br>got me thinking ​ so i answered ​ well i<br>usually follow a certain checklist to<br>create content whether its about an seo<br>article or writing seofriendly articles<br>to briefly walk you through i need to<br>ask my clients for the content brief<br>from there i draw lines on what needs to<br>be done and what needs to be<br>accomplished first like keyword research<br>and of course after everything is<br>written i need to get my clients<br>approval plus i put that on the system<br>that my client intends me to use one<br>example is wordpress she then answered<br>alright what made you apply for this<br>role as a marketing content writer<br>actually before i answer that let me<br>shed light on this so youd know where im<br>coming from and we could meet in between<br>i never optedin applying for the<br>position ​ i received a message from<br>your cofounding chief executive officer<br>on linkedin and he invited me for a<br>quick call which i religiously accepted<br>​ so it piqued my interest to attend<br>this quick call and i never expected<br>that its going to be a panel of<br>interviews pardon my line of answering i<br>mean we just need to be friendly calm<br>and jive here right ​ we proceeded to<br>the next question ​ can you walk me<br>through how you write content ​ ​ the<br>last question is ​ how much salary do<br>you expect from us ​ that depends<br>actually because i need to use certain<br>parameters like the length of time and<br>work rendered fulltime and parttime and<br>from that i can draw a ballpark figure<br>around k pesos per month ​ but hear me<br>out ​ as a freelance copywriter the<br>value and conversions i bring to the<br>table are three times greater than my<br>monthly salary ​ say one article costs $<br>and one case study project costs $ which<br>is what i expect however please do not<br>worry as this is merely my expectation<br>ultimately i am focused on<br>implementation and action j she seemed<br>content with my response and asked if i<br>had any questions to which i<br>respectfully obliged thank you actually<br>i have three questions two for you and<br>one for is that okay sure firstly what<br>is the unique selling proposition of<br>hikinex thanks next what values ​​can<br>you impart to me as an aspiring<br>candidate for the marketing content<br>writing position ​ she answered and<br>explained doing her best to provide<br>comprehensive responses ​ which i<br>completely understand i replied ​ she<br>then exclaimed oh p you really put me on<br>hot sit there ​ its alright i noticed<br>that you were doing your best and i<br>appreciate it ​ thank you ​ let me now<br>ask s a question ​ as the executive<br>recruiter of hikinex how do you counter<br>negative social proof comments and<br>reviews online + suspension notices<br>about your company ​ simply put we<br>ignore them as long as they do not<br>impact us also to answer your previous<br>question about the values ​​we impart to<br>aspiring candidates just be yourself we<br>do not micromanage ​ i understand s<br>thanks for that ​ i then delivered my<br>sales closing message thanking them for<br>taking the call with me and wishing them<br>luck with their future recruitment<br>activity ​ they said that they would<br>provide feedback within the week after<br>forwarding the recording to the hiring<br>manager ​ side note i started with an<br>end in mind ​ as a freelancer let us<br>avoid the mindset that we are business<br>employees we are business partners which<br>makes a significant difference ​<br>whatever the results may be i will not<br>proceed with the hiring process because<br>i noticed some red flags there are<br>plenty of them but i will not list them<br>down

          "i cant wait to resign long post ahead im<br>just really tired i do not work for a<br>business process outsourcing but i do<br>work in a contact center for a local<br>bank ive been on the post for more than<br>a year and honestly i want to fucking<br>leave im looking for someone to move to<br>it just so happens that i cant pass<br>since im still waiting on a good offer<br>the bills aint paying themselves and my<br>family doesnt have generational wealth<br>for me to resign without a new job it<br>used to be okay tbh i really do not like<br>taking calls i freaking hate what i do<br>but for experience and to keep myself<br>afloat i took the offer because when i<br>was looking for jobs this was the only<br>one that accepted me and my managers<br>were kind during my interview i couldnt<br>afford to buy any longer so i took the<br>risk and accepted the offer even though<br>it was too low when the basic one was<br>only able to make up for it because the<br>bank had good benefits but even so we<br>were so underpaid we were open even<br>though there were no international<br>clients too much then the shifting<br>schedule was still naggy thats me so i<br>know that the gy shift is unnecessary<br>because its legit that only a few pieces<br>are calling and the clients concerns can<br>wait until the morning and then they<br>added am to pm and pm to am before its<br>difficult to file leaves if there are<br>any youre with someone who cant come in<br>they have to look for someone to cover<br>that persons shift then theres also a<br>policy that if youre not working you<br>have to work on a rest day to make up<br>for it like i said were not business<br>process outsourcing but it feels like<br>that not entirely sure if this is also<br>the case with business process<br>outsourcing so dont come for me before<br>it ended they hired this new officer he<br>hasnt been in yet the wind is starting<br>to change there are so many changes in<br>the house rules that there is so much no<br>sense in the clean desk policy but the<br>officers have a lot of things on the<br>table those who have pedestals are not<br>allowed to be kept from them only<br>officers can do overtime every fucking<br>week the speed is fast but its annoying<br>to take leave and sl we have a target<br>because we have to meet at least answer<br>level every day so that we can pass the<br>end of the month what can we do we dont<br>have agents overall in one day we havent<br>made any calls how can we get the<br>desired one if we lack people overtime<br>is their answer even though we are all<br>tired in one day its not really possible<br>that the banks clients are increasing<br>but we are still like that they are<br>hiring but only one at a time how is the<br>bottom of the offer you only accept it<br>if you are very desperate to earn money<br>like me i was dazzled because there we<br>were laughing out loud loud but still<br>not enough i am writing this post<br>because i feel so bad i suddenly threw<br>up yesterday and i really dont know why<br>because im fine before coming to work we<br>have this break sched that we strictly<br>have to follow because if not iccrucify<br>they are just joking so my shift<br>yesterday was from am to pm my lunch was<br>at pm before i heated my food i had to<br>do number so i already knew something<br>was off then suddenly i lost my appetite<br>it could have been because of something<br>i sister but i didnt eat anything that<br>was foreign to me after forcing myself<br>to finish my baon i went to the comfort<br>room and threw up everything i ate i<br>immediately advised my team leader that<br>im not okay and if its possible to um i<br>just went home first he told me to go to<br>the clinic first and ask for meds so i<br>did and the doctor said reflux so they<br>gave me meds for that i went back to the<br>cr and i vomited again and number it was<br>much worse this time i took the medicine<br>after doing my thing and messaged my<br>team leader again telling him that i<br>really cant do it anymore when i got<br>back to my station i didnt do it right<br>away because i was waiting for them to<br>tell me if i was going home was it me or<br>not they were interviewing someone thats<br>why it took so long so i was irritated i<br>called first because i had a very bad<br>trip because its not my fault that i<br>suddenly vomited its not my fault that i<br>feel bad i rarely take absences even<br>when i was a student because there was<br>no reason for me to be absent when i was<br>gs and hs i always had perfect<br>attendance as in a school year i was not<br>absent unless i really needed to come to<br>work on time but for them it was late<br>because it should be at least minutes<br>before during your shift you are there i<br>am working on it i always go in even<br>though i am a little not okay i go back<br>after their interview my team leader<br>replied that i had gone to the clinic it<br>was crazy then i was told to rest first<br>then i will come back after an hour i<br>said ill just be patient because what<br>time is it but they insisted that i stop<br>making calls first since they were<br>already asking approval from the new<br>annoying boss if they could send me home<br>so i was there in the back of the office<br>resting after minutes the person came<br>team leader and they are sending me home<br>because they said i might not be able to<br>come in today they are concerned about<br>the al because the weekend is so<br>critical the al is more important than<br>my health okay okay so i didnt beat<br>myself up i went back to my station and<br>logged out and i went home with a bad<br>look when our inbound head thought you<br>killed me but when they were the ones<br>who were not okay they just twitched and<br>left immediately fucking bullshit so i<br>booked my move it and while on the way i<br>got sick again i said its a good thing i<br>went home i couldnt handle him when i<br>got home it was a complete disaster then<br>i started getting mild fever and i felt<br>really awful i didnt want to eat<br>anything because i lost my appetite and<br>im sure ill just throw up all the<br>gatorade water only porridge and<br>medicine my stomach said that it was<br>last night that i might not be able to<br>go in because i still feel really bad<br>and ill observe first if i can go in the<br>next day which is today i woke up around<br>am and vomited as for me when i checked<br>my phone my team leader replied and it<br>seemed like it was my fault that i wasnt<br>okay thats why i was allowed to go home<br>yesterday so i could come in today its<br>only my health that i have the right not<br>to go in even though im rd tom until<br>monday so i really cant go in where else<br>are my sick leave credits for decoration<br>bitch i can just send them a picture of<br>my vomit ill end it here if you made it<br>this far thanks

biggie in<br>business but i run multiple bigasan food<br>franchises small carwash village parking<br>space and airbnb in surf area up north<br>the others there i owned others are<br>shared businesses i still work as a<br>fulltime in a digital agency because we<br>are still slaves to and ive been in the<br>office since also and he is okay since<br>my colleagues know me about my<br>businesses this young colleague and<br>before approached me to asked about<br>starting a small business so i asked<br>what business and assess what kind of<br>knowledge he has about what he is going<br>to enter hell he said to be partnered by<br>his mom and girlfriend so i thought okay<br>the way he tells me his plans were good<br>so i offered to give him free<br>consultancy and coaching in business<br>then i told him i have a new business<br>that i got refreshment drinks maybe i<br>can place in then just split the profit<br>it has run smoothly for months and my<br>sales are good also although the main<br>business is slowly progressing but he is<br>ups i decided to invest in his business<br>as well i organized an inventory system<br>and then i looked for direct suppliers<br>that are really cheaper and also when i<br>have meetings i bring our products to<br>offer as free taste or sometimes i sell<br>it to clients haha ​​but the thing i<br>notice is why their sales are slow<br>before is and always closes because they<br>said there is nothing i asked him about<br>the employees because on paper it seems<br>like they are well compensated in viber<br>chats they are very okay to talk but he<br>said it was because they were acting so<br>i offered my help and called my<br>batchmate at school who was looking for<br>work i was actually going to put him at<br>the car wash but i begged him to go to<br>the store first luckily he seems to be<br>only a few minutes away from the<br>location he is actually closer than my<br>carwash so at first month the batchmates<br>feedback was also okay but not to my<br>colleague but to his gf and mom and but<br>when the colleague told me he rarely<br>shows up and always has a bad mouth<br>about them as employees i asked my<br>batchmate if he wants to move to the<br>carwash which he without any hesitation<br>said yes right there i know i am right<br>my colleague running a business has an<br>issue he got mad at me when i told him i<br>will pull out my batchmate because he is<br>really my person at the carwash saying<br>that it will be difficult for him to<br>find a store manager who is not artistic<br>i told him i will hire someone for his<br>convenience i got someone and he is<br>really good at managing a store but i<br>told him to report to me what is<br>happening at the store weeks later she<br>told me that the colleague was not doing<br>well so i decided to make a surprise<br>visit i asked our store manager to<br>inform me when he was going after all i<br>almost thought that i was the one<br>running our business from the money i<br>brought in the clients and bulk orders<br>that i entered as sales and more i cant<br>even go to the place regularly due to<br>the amount of walking i do here in metro<br>and province last saturday i received a<br>message from store manager with his gf<br>and mom so i went too i arrived mins<br>later after them and at the back door so<br>they cant see you i had just entered the<br>gate when i heard my colleagues voice<br>saying leave in front of me youre<br>useless so i didnt go in first since i<br>heard from the near window their convos<br>n i heard him again talking to that<br>employee go home you idiot thats your<br>job that employee ran to open the door<br>where i was standing outside when he<br>opened it he was surprised that i was<br>there i saw her eyes that were teary so<br>i signaled dont worry and ill wait<br>because im going to enter the store upon<br>entering i heard him shouting to his gf<br>who is in the storefront tell the store<br>manager and maybe ill look for a report<br>its still the same as the conversation<br>every saturday afternoon let him pass<br>the store manager reported to me on her<br>break but my colleague told her to do<br>the task even on break since she can do<br>it while sitting in my mind the dude is<br>very different compared when he is in<br>the office he is okay to talk to and his<br>character is very positive you can see<br>his immaturity but you get it because<br>hes still young but hes improving since<br>im already inside with my back turned i<br>called his attention he was surprised<br>and asked if why didnt i go in front i<br>told him i was there a while ago and and<br>i heard everything he said about our<br>employees to his badmouth against me he<br>asked me for a managements talk they<br>said we accepted but i asked the<br>employees to join the meeting to find<br>out what was going on i was shocked when<br>i heard from our employees the words<br>that were not because dont feel like an<br>expert its just a sari sari store your<br>strategy is not yet corporate and youre<br>boasting youre worthless these words<br>came to my colleagues mouth when he was<br>angry thats why our people leave even if<br>i leave like that i let our employees<br>out but i requested to close the store<br>and go home so they can cool down a bit<br>i talk to my colleague and his partner<br>that i cannot run business with them if<br>right there i said i will pullout my<br>investments and assets my colleague i<br>can pullout he said but its just my<br>drinks not the money i invested i<br>thought maybe i wasnt reading the books<br>i said we gain since i invested so i<br>will take my money and other things the<br>profit comes from me if he doesnt want<br>to give it last monday i pulled out my<br>investments from them i talked to my<br>colleagues mom and gf they helped me<br>withdraw my invested money from the bank<br>did the paperwork we notarized the bag<br>the store is closed since then none of<br>our employees came in the colleague was<br>absent at that time also in the office<br>until now our chief executive officer<br>knows because i was reported to him but<br>he said he is out of our transactions<br>because he is not part of his business<br>he spoke to me  i told my boss i can<br>work with him professionally in the<br>company but not as business partner<br>earlier i received a separate viber<br>group from our employees they said they<br>are no longer there i asked them if they<br>were paid the last pay they didnt want<br>me to tell them that they didnt want to<br>pay but i said they entered that so i<br>will pay they are right and i also told<br>them that i will help them find new jobs<br>that fit them luckily the store manager<br>is already at my client before she will<br>start ata by feb and i will refer them<br>to my clients at the convenience store<br>company and logistics courier company i<br>also send them a sack of rice each and<br>some groceries the experience was really<br>embarrassing and i learned a lot from<br>this i will always be grateful to those<br>employees who worked for me so as much<br>as possible ill give them extended help<br>at the very least we got out all in<br>toxic environment ​ ​",

background is fresh<br>graduate with no prior experience to<br>sales and business to business<br>relationship and right now im handling a<br>product for a year already with zero<br>sales i am the second person to handle<br>this product and ever since this product<br>was acquired by our company it has never<br>got any closed deal or income for the<br>company imagine that long and to give<br>you have more insight into my situation<br>it is not the type of product that is a<br>super necessity in an industry it was<br>just an upgrade for an existing market i<br>am under a lot of pressure since some of<br>the consumables of the equipment i am<br>selling will be soon expiring in the<br>middle of this year as well as the<br>license to sell it here in the<br>philippines dont get me wrong i have<br>done a lot on my part to sell joining<br>tradeshowsexhibits cold calling lead<br>generation offering it with zero down<br>payment with months installment package<br>is now the boss i wonder if i can go<br>directly to companies so i can meet my<br>clients personally since when i pitch<br>the lead to our salespeople who have a<br>car they dont prioritize it because they<br>know that nothing like this has been<br>sold yet and he is not a super necessity<br>my boss didnt allowed me to do so since<br>i dont have a car yet and for me to<br>establish a relationship he said i need<br>to visit them constantly therefore it<br>would mean that i would commute alone to<br>every entity that i have a lead which is<br>very tiring and costly on my part i have<br>also been able to conduct effective and<br>strategic product presentations and<br>demos with comparative slides with<br>clients current set up using other<br>alternatives and how theyre better when<br>they acquire our machine yet after<br>presenting it to the client the usual<br>responses would be he is not our<br>priority yet we actually dont need it<br>since we are currently using this<br>alternative we do not have the budget<br>for that we have other priorities maybe<br>we will try to pitch it to our bosses<br>next year for purchase our business<br>would still function without your<br>equipment on it therefore it isnt really<br>a necessity and some would also think<br>that i am just selling a useless product<br>i feel so degrading as a professional<br>that while i am presenting to clients i<br>can see that my customers are laughing<br>at me whispering mostly saying its not<br>that much his product is as essential as<br>the pain honestly i did everything i<br>could to learn the machine and grind it<br>during the product presentation then i<br>just whispered and laughed while doing<br>the product presentation i think maybe i<br>did something wrong while i was<br>presenting you know the audiences view<br>that i was just trying its selling when<br>its not that important to buy a also my<br>target market were so busy and they are<br>also a bit difficult to talk to because<br>they are in a restricted area some also<br>hand our salespeople a brochure of the<br>product that i handle and then just hand<br>it back to them saying that we dont need<br>it to be honest i feel so frustrated and<br>hopeless about it it feels like i am<br>pouring in a broken cup all my tiredness<br>and effort are just wasted for nothing<br>this is my first experience of working<br>in this industry and i dont know what to<br>do with the product i cant sell it im<br>going to resign for a little bit because<br>im under too much pressure and theres<br>too much chest pain there are still<br>times after the presentation i want to<br>cry because i feel like theyre not what<br>im presenting you know that feeling when<br>youre excited to tell a story and then<br>the person youre talking to i just laugh<br>at you and you seem uninterested its<br>hard how i wish i was assigned to fast<br>moving goods the pain is also that every<br>time my boss sees us or is with me<br>during a meeting with sales he always<br>brings up that im a failure when it<br>comes to selling this product im also<br>with my colleagues and especially with<br>my boss because the zero sales reflect<br>who i am i take full responsibility of<br>the situation to the point that<br>sometimes i feel like im not doing<br>anything right anymore im tired of doing<br>it over and over again ill get a lead<br>ill contact him set a schedule present<br>then ill just laugh while im presenting<br>ill just whisper then after the<br>presentation im sorry because hes not<br>our priority right now im thinking maybe<br>im just lacking in strategy or proper<br>sales training and handling negotiation<br>as well as how to add urgency to<br>presentation even if i want to resign i<br>dont want to look like a failure by<br>leaving my boss and the company that<br>they didnt get anything from all the<br>training and salary they invested in me<br>so as long as i can i will find a way to<br>close at least one deal im stuck with<br>what i feel in fact im tired but i dont<br>want to give up because its embarrassing<br>for her and i also dont want to leave<br>the company as a failure because im not<br>a quitter im having a hard time selling<br>so i hope youll be kind to those you<br>call agents who are just studying we<br>stay awake and work hard for the<br>products we present we also have<br>families you can help us

i still work as a<br>fulltime in a digital agency because we<br>are still slaves to and ive been in the<br>office since also and he is okay since<br>my colleagues know me about my<br>businesses this young colleague and<br>before approached me to asked about<br>starting a small business so i asked<br>what business and assess what kind of<br>knowledge he has about what he is going<br>to enter hell he said to be partnered by<br>his mom and girlfriend so i thought okay<br>the way he tells me his plans were good<br>so i offered to give him free<br>consultancy and coaching in business<br>then i told him i have a new business<br>that i got refreshment drinks maybe i<br>can place in then just split the profit<br>it has run smoothly for months and my<br>sales are good also although the main<br>business is slowly progressing but he is<br>ups i decided to invest in his business<br>as well i organized an inventory system<br>and then i looked for direct suppliers<br>that are really cheaper and also when i<br>have meetings i bring our products to<br>offer as free taste or sometimes i sell<br>it to clients haha ​​but the thing i<br>notice is why their sales are slow<br>before is and always closes because they<br>said there is nothing i asked him about<br>the employees because on paper it seems<br>like they are well compensated in viber<br>chats they are very okay to talk but he<br>said it was because they were acting so<br>i offered my help and called my<br>batchmate at school who was looking for<br>work i was actually going to put him at<br>the car wash but i begged him to go to<br>the store first luckily he seems to be<br>only a few minutes away from the<br>location he is actually closer than my<br>carwash so at first month the batchmates<br>feedback was also okay but not to my<br>colleague but to his gf and mom and but<br>when the colleague told me he rarely<br>shows up and always has a bad mouth<br>about them as employees i asked my<br>batchmate if he wants to move to the<br>carwash which he without any hesitation<br>said yes right there i know i am right<br>my colleague running a business has an<br>issue he got mad at me when i told him i<br>will pull out my batchmate because he is<br>really my person at the carwash saying<br>that it will be difficult for him to<br>find a store manager who is not artistic<br>i told him i will hire someone for his<br>convenience i got someone and he is<br>really good at managing a store but i<br>told him to report to me what is<br>happening at the store weeks later she<br>told me that the colleague was not doing<br>well so i decided to make a surprise<br>visit i asked our store manager to<br>inform me when he was going after all i<br>almost thought that i was the one<br>running our business from the money i<br>brought in the clients and bulk orders<br>that i entered as sales and more i cant<br>even go to the place regularly due to<br>the amount of walking i do here in metro<br>and province last saturday i received a<br>message from store manager with his gf<br>and mom so i went too i arrived mins<br>later after them and at the back door so<br>they cant see you i had just entered the<br>gate when i heard my colleagues voice<br>saying leave in front of me youre<br>useless so i didnt go in first since i<br>heard from the near window their convos<br>n i heard him again talking to that<br>employee go home you idiot thats your<br>job that employee ran to open the door<br>where i was standing outside when he<br>opened it he was surprised that i was<br>there i saw her eyes that were teary so<br>i signaled dont worry and ill wait<br>because im going to enter the store upon<br>entering i heard him shouting to his gf<br>who is in the storefront tell the store<br>manager and maybe ill look for a report<br>its still the same as the conversation<br>every saturday afternoon let him pass<br>the store manager reported to me on her<br>break but my colleague told her to do<br>the task even on break since she can do<br>it while sitting in my mind the dude is<br>very different compared when he is in<br>the office he is okay to talk to and his<br>character is very positive you can see<br>his immaturity but you get it because<br>hes still young but hes improving since<br>im already inside with my back turned i<br>called his attention he was surprised<br>and asked if why didnt i go in front i<br>told him i was there a while ago and and<br>i heard everything he said about our<br>employees to his badmouth against me he<br>asked me for a managements talk they<br>said we accepted but i asked the<br>employees to join the meeting to find<br>out what was going on i was shocked when<br>i heard from our employees the words<br>that were not because dont feel like an<br>expert its just a sari sari store your<br>strategy is not yet corporate and youre<br>boasting youre worthless these words<br>came to my colleagues mouth when he was<br>angry thats why our people leave even if<br>i leave like that i let our employees<br>out but i requested to close the store<br>and go home so they can cool down a bit<br>i talk to my colleague and his partner<br>that i cannot run business with them if<br>right there i said i will pullout my<br>investments and assets my colleague i<br>can pullout he said but its just my<br>drinks not the money i invested i<br>thought maybe i wasnt reading the books<br>i said we gain since i invested so i<br>will take my money and other things the<br>profit comes from me if he doesnt want<br>to give it last monday i pulled out my<br>investments from them i talked to my<br>colleagues mom and gf they helped me<br>withdraw my invested money from the bank<br>did the paperwork we notarized the bag<br>the store is closed since then none of<br>our employees came in the colleague was<br>absent at that time also in the office<br>until now our chief executive officer<br>knows because i was reported to him but<br>he said he is out of our transactions<br>because he is not part of his business<br>he spoke to me  i told my boss i can<br>work with him professionally in the<br>company but not as business partner<br>earlier i received a separate viber<br>group from our employees they said they<br>are no longer there i asked them if they<br>were paid the last pay they didnt want<br>me to tell them that they didnt want to<br>pay but i said they entered that so i<br>will pay they are right and i also told<br>them that i will help them find new jobs<br>that fit them luckily the store manager<br>is already at my client before she will<br>start ata by feb and i will refer them<br>to my clients at the convenience store<br>company and logistics courier company i<br>also send them a sack of rice each and<br>some groceries the experience was really<br>embarrassing and i learned a lot from<br>this i will always be grateful to those<br>employees who worked for me so as much<br>as possible ill give them extended

          "im tired of selling a product that no<br>one is buying yet i just want to release<br>my thoughts and ask for advice here so<br>thank you very much to those who will<br>listen to me here my background is fresh<br>graduate with no prior experience to<br>sales and business to business<br>relationship and right now im handling a<br>product for a year already with zero<br>sales i am the second person to handle<br>this product and ever since this product<br>was acquired by our company it has never<br>got any closed deal or income for the<br>company imagine that long and to give<br>you have more insight into my situation<br>it is not the type of product that is a<br>super necessity in an industry it was<br>just an upgrade for an existing market i<br>am under a lot of pressure since some of<br>the consumables of the equipment i am<br>selling will be soon expiring in the<br>middle of this year as well as the<br>license to sell it here in the<br>philippines dont get me wrong i have<br>done a lot on my part to sell joining<br>tradeshowsexhibits cold calling lead<br>generation offering it with zero down<br>payment with months installment package<br>is now the boss i wonder if i can go<br>directly to companies so i can meet my<br>clients personally since when i pitch<br>the lead to our salespeople who have a<br>car they dont prioritize it because they<br>know that nothing like this has been<br>sold yet and he is not a super necessity<br>my boss didnt allowed me to do so since<br>i dont have a car yet and for me to<br>establish a relationship he said i need<br>to visit them constantly therefore it<br>would mean that i would commute alone to<br>every entity that i have a lead which is<br>very tiring and costly on my part i have<br>also been able to conduct effective and<br>strategic product presentations and<br>demos with comparative slides with<br>clients current set up using other<br>alternatives and how theyre better when<br>they acquire our machine yet after<br>presenting it to the client the usual<br>responses would be he is not our<br>priority yet we actually dont need it<br>since we are currently using this<br>alternative we do not have the budget<br>for that we have other priorities maybe<br>we will try to pitch it to our bosses<br>next year for purchase our business<br>would still function without your<br>equipment on it therefore it isnt really<br>a necessity and some would also think<br>that i am just selling a useless product<br>i feel so degrading as a professional<br>that while i am presenting to clients i<br>can see that my customers are laughing<br>at me whispering mostly saying its not<br>that much his product is as essential as<br>the pain honestly i did everything i<br>could to learn the machine and grind it<br>during the product presentation then i<br>just whispered and laughed while doing<br>the product presentation i think maybe i<br>did something wrong while i was<br>presenting you know the audiences view<br>that i was just trying its selling when<br>its not that important to buy a also my<br>target market were so busy and they are<br>also a bit difficult to talk to because<br>they are in a restricted area some also<br>hand our salespeople a brochure of the<br>product that i handle and then just hand<br>it back to them saying that we dont need<br>it to be honest i feel so frustrated and<br>hopeless about it it feels like i am<br>pouring in a broken cup all my tiredness<br>and effort are just wasted for nothing<br>this is my first experience of working<br>in this industry and i dont know what to<br>do with the product i cant sell it im<br>going to resign for a little bit because<br>im under too much pressure and theres<br>too much chest pain there are still<br>times after the presentation i want to<br>cry because i feel like theyre not what<br>im presenting you know that feeling when<br>youre excited to tell a story and then<br>the person youre talking to i just laugh<br>at you and you seem uninterested its<br>hard how i wish i was assigned to fast<br>moving goods the pain is also that every<br>time my boss sees us or is with me<br>during a meeting with sales he always<br>brings up that im a failure when it<br>comes to selling this product im also<br>with my colleagues and especially with<br>my boss because the zero sales reflect<br>who i am i take full responsibility of<br>the situation to the point that<br>sometimes i feel like im not doing<br>anything right anymore im tired of doing<br>it over and over again ill get a lead<br>ill contact him set a schedule present<br>then ill just laugh while im presenting<br>ill just whisper then after the<br>presentation im sorry because hes not<br>our priority right now im thinking maybe<br>im just lacking in strategy or proper<br>sales training and handling negotiation<br>as well as how to add urgency to<br>presentation even if i want to resign i<br>dont want to look like a failure by<br>leaving my boss and the company that<br>they didnt get anything from all the<br>training and salary they invested in me<br>so as long as i can i will find a way to<br>close at least one deal im stuck with<br>what i feel in fact im tired but i dont<br>want to give up because its embarrassing<br>for her and i also dont want to leave<br>the company as a failure because im not<br>a quitter im having a hard time selling<br>so i hope youll be kind to those you<br>call agents who are just studying we<br>stay awake and work hard for the<br>products we present we also have<br>families you can help us when we present<br>not all agents just want to sell and<br>then leave you in the air when after<br>sales others are really willing to help<br>you with your current problem and ready<br>to assist until after sales thank you if<br>you get to this point i just want to<br>release my frustrations with my work<br>because i dont really know who to tell<br>this to im stuck under the pressure of<br>my boss and the pressure that nothing<br>has been sold yet and if anyone can get<br>advice you are in my situation thank you<br>too i really appreciate it",

and i dont want to assume<br>that my race or gender had anything to<br>do with this but for the last months<br>theyve been talking behind my back my<br>leads expect me to perform when everyone<br>else gets away with they refuse to cover<br>me when i go to the bathroom but when<br>they go they go whenever they want and<br>their friends always cover them there is<br>only one guy who covers for me and he<br>isnt even from our area when i started<br>learning a lot of different work most of<br>the men there do not respect me or my<br>area and ive been physically<br>uncomfortable at times by things that<br>were said and done to me and i went to<br>human resource in the past for the<br>treatment ive been receiving from an old<br>supervisor yes a supervisor and human<br>resource did nothing about it nowadays i<br>just dont talk to anyone because<br>everyone kisses each others behind i<br>stay away from that i have social<br>anxiety but that doesnt stop me from<br>doing my job and that doesnt stop me<br>from speaking up when something happens<br>but its the lack of empathy and lack of<br>understanding that makes me never speak<br>up on what happens to me and now of all<br>thingsi have to deal with lost wages i<br>know this is a lot to try and understand<br>for an outsider looking i but i am<br>calling on help from anyone who has<br>knowledge of what this situation is and<br>the next steps i should take are ive<br>been to human resource so many times<br>payroll times talked with supervisors<br>and nothing has been done not for the<br>treatment the harassment the bullying<br>the lost wages or the missing time off<br>my check i just need help and i need the<br>money from them but they havent given me<br>anything in over weeks just to confirm<br>that they did absolutely nothing i just<br>got paid after using all of my paid time<br>off for the first time in months and i<br>got my same check but my last check was<br>short almost waaaay over half which is<br>about $ $ i cant quit and i cant speak<br>up i cant even get paid decently without<br>them screwing up something and every<br>time i bring an issue to their attention<br>they brush it off there is so much more<br>that has happened and i want to tell my<br>story but im so afraid of it sounding<br>like im ranting or complaining or making<br>this up i need to get out of this<br>specific job and elevate within the<br>company but this company has purposely<br>limited our ability to apply for other<br>positions because every thing beyond<br>being an associate requires you to have<br>a bs degree and years +

meeting<br>earlier so it will continue tomorrow<br>warning suicide ideation toxic workplace<br>abusive parents bear with me maybe long<br>but maybe necessary so that its clear if<br>no one replies maybe ill post it again<br>in another subreddit i just read and<br>watched from the internet that human<br>resources are more concerned with the<br>companys growth its image etc than with<br>the plight and wellbeing of employees in<br>fact human resources mentioned in the<br>beginning of the conversation that she<br>is trying to create projects for the<br>betterment of the company she is not a<br>direct indication that she might be<br>biased for the company but she also did<br>not say about what she could do for the<br>employees themselves she also<br>highlighted the importance of hard work<br>and the one i mentioned was one of my<br>complaints about having a workload for<br>people she replied by saying that the<br>positions are really multidisciplinary<br>nowadays tbf maybe since she was in a<br>hurry to leave at that point she only<br>thought it was variety of work instead<br>of workload amount but the latter was<br>said my people may be able to use what<br>you saidclaimed and use it against you<br>the thing is there is a scenario at work<br>but if i cannot trust human resource<br>since they are not really foremployee<br>like the labor union i dont want to<br>continue telling my story since it was<br>cut off our convo was due to time limit<br>so i was only able to say that they were<br>nice around the story because small talk<br>first caught me off guard and i forgot<br>warning of other online people about<br>human resource in general however maybe<br>wrong me good people exist after all<br>even in the most surprising of places in<br>fact one of the higher up bosses noticed<br>my depression so she told human resource<br>to reach out to me though to be fair<br>even this doesnt excuse the toxicity of<br>the company itself allowing catcalling a<br>supervisor throwing away someones shoes<br>etc and i need help i dont have much<br>money the salary is correct and there is<br>still debt to pay i dont want to go back<br>to abusive parents and ive been feeling<br>suicidal because they dont want to<br>regularize me and comforting that my<br>plan z is the end instead of being a fat<br>person or feel the love language of my<br>abuse again so if human resource and<br>other people have my best interests that<br>would be beneficial the higher up<br>supervisor even told me that maybe human<br>resource can offer me a job to another<br>sister company to put everything in<br>context this is what happened during my<br>work assessment i had a minipanic attack<br>when the words my boss used were more<br>fearinducing like what will the higher<br>ups say or what will be our excuse when<br>you wont meet the quota i know its less<br>intimidating if you are not there tbf i<br>only have less than half of the tasks so<br>maybe he remembers that thats why hes<br>slowing me down what if im the second<br>person to do it but still you know why<br>blame someone for not meeting the quota<br>if you know the workload amount is for<br>people or would eventually be filled me<br>too because i give reasons for her<br>complaints to me and she just brushes<br>them off and doesnt even acknowledge<br>them in the end i couldnt bear my upset<br>i replied that i will talk to the higher<br>ups the next time she mentioned them i<br>said after saying that i panicked bec i<br>remembered my fi cialfamily situation<br>but i was too upset to mitigate the<br>damage i call it a minipanic attack bec<br>i became aggressive with my behavior<br>defensive mode and i cannot seem return<br>playing submissive i cried too after<br>left and i attempted to knock on the<br>literal neighboring office different<br>company and ask for a job because i saw<br>the secretary last time and she said how<br>the boss was so nice and had even<br>recently offered a job to a family<br>friend that she hopes is his boss lives<br>for a long time to help more people but<br>when i came she was cold and adamant<br>that her boss was tired she also<br>reported me to my boss that i went to<br>them crying pls in the comments later i<br>already know my mistake pls be gentle i<br>feel ashamed and raw about it they later<br>told me that the secretaries boss was<br>sensitive i dont know if body or<br>emotions and didnt like surprise<br>meetings anyway boss implied that that<br>was the sign shes looking for since she<br>was undecided about me and said she also<br>didnt like my attitude during assessment<br>she said she would give me the<br>regularization as long as i am and say<br>that i will do my best not her exact<br>words but along those lines but she said<br>i did not do well with the neighboring<br>secretaries boss i feel so ashamed im<br>sorry everyone it seems like a bad image<br>to them and why do you think i have<br>anger issues i tried to explain asked<br>for a second chance but he said it was<br>too late because even the higher ups<br>have already agreed with the decision im<br>so upset and wanna go absent without<br>leave but my coworkers convinced me to<br>wait for the last pay and certificate of<br>experience i went half day the day i was<br>told and one of my friends heard the<br>comment of my wanting to kill myself he<br>took me seriously it seemed my vibe was<br>pretty gloomy calls and texts sent to me<br>he told the whole office in his panic<br>the next day was normal since i<br>explained via text to my panicked friend<br>to calm down i know my boss knows but<br>she doesnt mention it so thats the whole<br>story the question is it safe tell the<br>hr will my saying so benefit future<br>employees in regards to mental health i<br>told her but not everything i havent<br>mentioned around the part when i knocked<br>on the neighboring office i also<br>mentioned my panic attack and when she<br>asked me if ive experienced it before i<br>said yes i said that my parents were the<br>cause of my panic attack before bec they<br>have a toxic personality style so back<br>to my question would it be good to tell<br>human resource the whole story what are<br>the pros and cons and if i decided not<br>to tell the whole story the next time we<br>meet what will i say this human resource<br>spans more than one company so busy and<br>its not like my coworkers intheknow<br>would care enough to narrate to human<br>resource so that shed know my story is<br>incomplete what

culturally fit in our<br>office the reason is the ex human<br>resource representative about me im one<br>of the youngest members of the company<br>and the gap between us with our older<br>coworkers is at least years basically my<br>coworkers are all in their early to mid<br>s small company but this isnt my first<br>company but this is one of the first<br>companies where i felt very comfortable<br>with the work and environment were also<br>very lean in our company for the<br>philippines we are team it all started<br>when i developed a friendship with one<br>of the managers from a different<br>department now we dont exactly work in<br>the same department so work has nothing<br>to do with how we became friends it just<br>turned out one day that she liked<br>hanging out with me and we listen to a<br>lot of similar music we got even closer<br>when i offered to help her get tickets<br>to one concert she wanted to go do bad<br>but she conflicted with a worktrip i had<br>the connections and i wasnt  so i<br>secured them for her and she was<br>thankful ever since then wed get into<br>conversations about concerts music fests<br>travel the like thats all because i<br>escape from all the stresses of work is<br>the only reason why i work hard to be<br>able to afford those now comes the<br>trouble a close friend in the office is<br>also best friends with the human<br>resource representative of the company<br>he is the one who enters and they go way<br>back even being co workers in a previous<br>job once before our company now before i<br>would even feel like im intruding in<br>their friendship when close friend would<br>ask me to go with them both to buy<br>office supplies or run errands for the<br>company during weekends again im a<br>homebody and going out sometimes would<br>do my mental health good the dynamic is<br>okay at first i just noticed that it<br>seems like a close friend gets treated<br>badly by human resource representative<br>me minding my own business kept that<br>observation to myself at the end of the<br>day i have no say in their friendship if<br>time yung theyre probably tighter than<br>me and my close friend ve been friends<br>for longer but that doesnt really mean<br>anything to me months into my employment<br>in the company i also found one of my<br>close friends lets name her b needing<br>work and im the type to help out<br>whenever i can so i put in a good work<br>and thankfully i take note around this<br>time we are still okay and my exbest<br>friend is super solid shes years older<br>than me so i respect her the way i would<br>my elders close friend even encouraged<br>me to put in the good word because she<br>says she trusts me with whoever i vouch<br>for especially since will be working<br>under her in case and did get hired she<br>would work under close friend and id be<br>drowning in work from my department<br>while also training while i offload some<br>of my responsibilities to her at the<br>request of the company to make me focus<br>on other things around this time also i<br>found myself having to hold back on<br>company gatherings with weekly dinners<br>because we are every wednesday because<br>my dad got diagnosed with cancer and my<br>mental health was very bad due to<br>overworking myself one day though the<br>boss which is the cofounder scolded me<br>because something went wrong with<br>handling a client and sadly it was b of<br>course best friend so i tried my best to<br>appease the bosss anger and for no she i<br>made sure close friend knew so she can<br>also help me out as is directly under<br>her  both close friend and i spent a<br>good hours solving the problem and she<br>didnt even reply hours later after the<br>shift so weekend i saw its just<br>subtweeting bad words ~ pertaining to me<br>about work and even saying im using my<br>mental health as an excuse why she was<br>attacking me i dont know i was too busy<br>hours before that cleaning up her mess i<br>told close friend about it and she was<br>just confused as i was where all this<br>hostility was coming from especially<br>when close friend and i have been<br>cleaning up after friend ever since she<br>got into the company the kicker here is<br>that  has always confided to me about<br>having post partum the reason why i<br>wanted her to get into ours company so<br>bad because the pay was significantly<br>higher than her old company plus this<br>would greatly help her pay off her bills<br>i rarely indulge her when she confides<br>in me about her marital trouble because<br>im honestly not a good fit to give her<br>advice on that i just make sure to let<br>her know that people are not her enemy<br>her partner is not her enemy and she<br>should give them the chance its sad<br>because she never gave me the chance and<br>immediately assumed i was mad at her for<br>having to pick up after friend at work<br>when really i was just working on<br>autopilot with all the heavy baggage i<br>was already carrying on my own besides<br>post partum is a lot i could go longer<br>not letting her know about my dads<br>diagnosis or my own head going to shit<br>but turns out friend b and human<br>resource representative has already been<br>harboring ill will towards me a few more<br>months after that incident friend has<br>been making it harder for me to do my<br>work so one day i snapped everything got<br>to me and this got the attention of our<br>management and our us team im not one to<br>complain but ive had enough we got a<br>mediation meeting happen  friend in<br>front of me accusing me of making her<br>feel like she was indebted to me when<br>all the time she was in the company ive<br>been focusing on my work and helping<br>clean up whatever work she messed up<br>just so our cofounder wouldnt get mad at<br>her even further during that mediation<br>though it was clear that human resource<br>representative was very biased towards<br>friend b in the process and management<br>even found more instances where human<br>resource representative was breaking<br>company protoc this lead to her and<br>friend being put under and me let off<br>with a warning for acting unbecoming of<br>myself at work after that i simply gray<br>rocked them both i simply cut off my<br>friendship with a year friendship down<br>the drain we were so close that i even<br>let her stay for weeks in my apartment<br>when she and her family would fight so<br>close that i missed a day of work<br>because i ran around town buying them<br>groceries and medicine when i found out<br>their house got cordoned after she got<br>covid during the pandemic i couldnt<br>handle the disrespect the worst thing<br>about this all is the human resource<br>representative is still angry with me<br>why we dont know i feel she gets angrier<br>when i gray rock her when i stay out of<br>her way do whatever she says be the<br>bigger person and just not give in to<br>her taunts shes come to a point that<br>even when  was already let go of the<br>company she would stoop so low as to<br>rally all the new hires against me<br>before even getting to know me she is<br>also very petty i got hospitalized for a<br>week in november for dengue and lets be<br>honest my mental health probably made it<br>even worse i barely get hospitalized our<br>management was so worried and tasked her<br>to send fruits my way but when she found<br>out that close friend has been dropping<br>by to see me after work no one came even<br>apple juice now to the pip part aware<br>that the management is treating me like<br>that just this december i was made to<br>work from home indefinitely to somehow<br>protect me from the hostility of the<br>situation work no longer felt safe for<br>me and im sure my performance decreased<br>with the treatment ive been getting at<br>work only the us team really treated me<br>as human as well as close friend  the<br>higher ups think its because human<br>resource rep is jealous of my friendship<br>with close friend but i dont get that im<br>not the one who forces close friend to<br>hang out with me she just wants to and i<br>dont refuse if it means i get to go out<br>of the house we even invited her out to<br>join us before until she stopped coming<br>on her own accord i just feel like its<br>very unfair im under  for basically<br>being bullied at work i never confront<br>them because theyre all older than me by<br>significant years naman ng  whats more<br>unfair i have many more opportunities in<br>the company and human resource<br>representative is just paying off debt<br>she owes to the company before resigning<br>i have so much to lose while she doesnt<br>thats all hahahah do not know

          "can i trust the human resource enough<br>for me to tell everything that happened<br>since i will be leaving the company<br>again soon anyway it was cut short<br>because we had a oneonone meeting<br>earlier so it will continue tomorrow<br>warning suicide ideation toxic workplace<br>abusive parents bear with me maybe long<br>but maybe necessary so that its clear if<br>no one replies maybe ill post it again<br>in another subreddit i just read and<br>watched from the internet that human<br>resources are more concerned with the<br>companys growth its image etc than with<br>the plight and wellbeing of employees in<br>fact human resources mentioned in the<br>beginning of the conversation that she<br>is trying to create projects for the<br>betterment of the company she is not a<br>direct indication that she might be<br>biased for the company but she also did<br>not say about what she could do for the<br>employees themselves she also<br>highlighted the importance of hard work<br>and the one i mentioned was one of my<br>complaints about having a workload for<br>people she replied by saying that the<br>positions are really multidisciplinary<br>nowadays tbf maybe since she was in a<br>hurry to leave at that point she only<br>thought it was variety of work instead<br>of workload amount but the latter was<br>said my people may be able to use what<br>you saidclaimed and use it against you<br>the thing is there is a scenario at work<br>but if i cannot trust human resource<br>since they are not really foremployee<br>like the labor union i dont want to<br>continue telling my story since it was<br>cut off our convo was due to time limit<br>so i was only able to say that they were<br>nice around the story because small talk<br>first caught me off guard and i forgot<br>warning of other online people about<br>human resource in general however maybe<br>wrong me good people exist after all<br>even in the most surprising of places in<br>fact one of the higher up bosses noticed<br>my depression so she told human resource<br>to reach out to me though to be fair<br>even this doesnt excuse the toxicity of<br>the company itself allowing catcalling a<br>supervisor throwing away someones shoes<br>etc and i need help i dont have much<br>money the salary is correct and there is<br>still debt to pay i dont want to go back<br>to abusive parents and ive been feeling<br>suicidal because they dont want to<br>regularize me and comforting that my<br>plan z is the end instead of being a fat<br>person or feel the love language of my<br>abuse again so if human resource and<br>other people have my best interests that<br>would be beneficial the higher up<br>supervisor even told me that maybe human<br>resource can offer me a job to another<br>sister company to put everything in<br>context this is what happened during my<br>work assessment i had a minipanic attack<br>when the words my boss used were more<br>fearinducing like what will the higher<br>ups say or what will be our excuse when<br>you wont meet the quota i know its less<br>intimidating if you are not there tbf i<br>only have less than half of the tasks so<br>maybe he remembers that thats why hes<br>slowing me down what if im the second<br>person to do it but still you know why<br>blame someone for not meeting the quota<br>if you know the workload amount is for<br>people or would eventually be filled me<br>too because i give reasons for her<br>complaints to me and she just brushes<br>them off and doesnt even acknowledge<br>them in the end i couldnt bear my upset<br>i replied that i will talk to the higher<br>ups the next time she mentioned them i<br>said after saying that i panicked bec i<br>remembered my fi cialfamily situation<br>but i was too upset to mitigate the<br>damage i call it a minipanic attack bec<br>i became aggressive with my behavior<br>defensive mode and i cannot seem return<br>playing submissive i cried too after<br>left and i attempted to knock on the<br>literal neighboring office different<br>company and ask for a job because i saw<br>the secretary last time and she said how<br>the boss was so nice and had even<br>recently offered a job to a family<br>friend that she hopes is his boss lives<br>for a long time to help more people but<br>when i came she was cold and adamant<br>that her boss was tired she also<br>reported me to my boss that i went to<br>them crying pls in the comments later i<br>already know my mistake pls be gentle i<br>feel ashamed and raw about it they later<br>told me that the secretaries boss was<br>sensitive i dont know if body or<br>emotions and didnt like surprise<br>meetings anyway boss implied that that<br>was the sign shes looking for since she<br>was undecided about me and said she also<br>didnt like my attitude during assessment<br>she said she would give me the<br>regularization as long as i am and say<br>that i will do my best not her exact<br>words but along those lines but she said<br>i did not do well with the neighboring<br>secretaries boss i feel so ashamed im<br>sorry everyone it seems like a bad image<br>to them and why do you think i have<br>anger issues i tried to explain asked<br>for a second chance but he said it was<br>too late because even the higher ups<br>have already agreed with the decision im<br>so upset and wanna go absent without<br>leave but my coworkers convinced me to<br>wait for the last pay and certificate of<br>experience i went half day the day i was<br>told and one of my friends heard the<br>comment of my wanting to kill myself he<br>took me seriously it seemed my vibe was<br>pretty gloomy calls and texts sent to me<br>he told the whole office in his panic<br>the next day was normal since i<br>explained via text to my panicked friend<br>to calm down i know my boss knows but<br>she doesnt mention it so thats the whole<br>story the question is it safe tell the<br>hr will my saying so benefit future<br>employees in regards to mental health i<br>told her but not everything i havent<br>mentioned around the part when i knocked<br>on the neighboring office i also<br>mentioned my panic attack and when she<br>asked me if ive experienced it before i<br>said yes i said that my parents were the<br>cause of my panic attack before bec they<br>have a toxic personality style so back<br>to my question would it be good to tell<br>human resource the whole story what are<br>the pros and cons and if i decided not<br>to tell the whole story the next time we<br>meet what will i say this human resource<br>spans more than one company so busy and<br>its not like my coworkers intheknow<br>would care enough to narrate to human<br>resource so that shed know my story is<br>incomplete what

          "the story of the person who resigned<br>took the place of the person who<br>resigned and lost his job bow im going<br>to rant right away but ill go through<br>the story so that his last day january<br>for cutoff will be full of salary<br>backpay but prior to that his<br>replacement has arrived in january so<br>here it is you know the drill he is<br>turning over here because he replaced<br>him a veteran who resigned so it is<br>surprising that he is leaving the<br>company but even though he has so many<br>unaddressed or pending tasks that have<br>been over a year because there is still<br>something in the turnover files its just<br>a bit annoying because in his time he<br>got to the point where he didnt really<br>pay attention to the one who resigned he<br>joined in january so far so good his<br>luck is actually something he doesnt<br>know because there are many people<br>waiting for him money by the way pending<br>task referred to by the person who<br>resigned for the replacement of the<br>person who resigned i know it was<br>explained to him but i dont know if i<br>talked to the person who resigned i had<br>a coffee break we talked i gave tips i<br>told the cons of the work but it was<br>really too shallow besides for him there<br>was nothing its just that hes used to<br>being dead hes just basically not<br>feeling the cons that i said based on<br>his answers in the story time passes of<br>course according to the resigner<br>teaching the resigner and we see how he<br>teaches its really okay even manager<br>boss and colleagues which is us if he<br>has questions and concerns dont be shy<br>because our brains are not closed<br>knowing him and his pending tasks but<br>this is the plot twist of the one who<br>resigned by thursday rd day since when<br>he resigned too he was very annoyed<br>because he wasted a lot and he had a lot<br>of each department assistant head he ate<br>the managers which i should know because<br>he has experienced i know how they can<br>orient themselves its really okay and<br>then suddenly he leaves you know whats<br>annoying is that he still had a lot of<br>problems when i was talking to him and<br>then we found out that he was demanding<br>another job he wanted the job of a new<br>colleague of his if possible they say<br>that they are the ones that you havent<br>proven yet but if you can demand what<br>you want to be your job he is jealous<br>because the one at the same time as him<br>doesnt have much but also because there<br>are no tasks there and there is no<br>basically i am talking incentives and<br>commission here thats why i said the hes<br>lucky after all hes like the fresh<br>graduates who are demanding that nothing<br>has been proven he resigned immediately<br>because of anxiety so its already friday<br>january managers in the area because of<br>the disturbance he caused should have<br>resigned when he saw that he was just<br>teaching him and he sees the multitude<br>of pending tasks that he has some<br>questions for him because thats how it<br>is with new people and our boss is very<br>open to concerns because i felt him when<br>i was new i say that i really notice and<br>my concerns immediately as a newbie<br>anyway according to friday january this<br>is the shocking twist they will no<br>longer accept new employees as<br>replacements nor will those who resigned<br>and take the place of those who resigned<br>thats why they have pending tasks with<br>their colleagues and i am one of the<br>workers to be honest its not really the<br>case the problem is because he doesnt<br>have a proper turnover imagine he is<br>still adapting to take over from the one<br>who resigned obviously he hasnt done<br>much yet in fact he didnt get what he<br>was taught nor did he resign we only<br>found out on thursday thats why he<br>resigned because he didnt get it either<br>all of a sudden all of a sudden on<br>friday he pmed us with pending tasks so<br>i almost didnt have a coffee break<br>because of the inquiries he suddenly<br>passed my contact details and voila one<br>after the other he didnt even have an<br>explanation of what we were going to do<br>with the pending as long as he emailed<br>which is we dont understand as long as<br>he is a table of details of his pending<br>task but you cant understand anything<br>from the remarks because its either<br>blank or just some random information<br>that has no indication of what it is<br>whats my rant ruined my weekends are<br>supposed to be gone now i should be but<br>because of course i worked all day on my<br>rest day from the morning i woke up<br>until this morning when i typed this i<br>still havent done it which is annoying<br>considering that we are in the planning<br>stage because this is how it is",

          "im the one but im the one who was put on<br>the pip magone year anniversary at work<br>and i dont know how ive made it this<br>long just this month i was put on pip<br>for not being culturally fit in our<br>office the reason is the ex human<br>resource representative about me im one<br>of the youngest members of the company<br>and the gap between us with our older<br>coworkers is at least years basically my<br>coworkers are all in their early to mid<br>s small company but this isnt my first<br>company but this is one of the first<br>companies where i felt very comfortable<br>with the work and environment were also<br>very lean in our company for the<br>philippines we are team it all started<br>when i developed a friendship with one<br>of the managers from a different<br>department now we dont exactly work in<br>the same department so work has nothing<br>to do with how we became friends it just<br>turned out one day that she liked<br>hanging out with me and we listen to a<br>lot of similar music we got even closer<br>when i offered to help her get tickets<br>to one concert she wanted to go do bad<br>but she conflicted with a worktrip i had<br>the connections and i wasnt  so i<br>secured them for her and she was<br>thankful ever since then wed get into<br>conversations about concerts music fests<br>travel the like thats all because i<br>escape from all the stresses of work is<br>the only reason why i work hard to be<br>able to afford those now comes the<br>trouble a close friend in the office is<br>also best friends with the human<br>resource representative of the company<br>he is the one who enters and they go way<br>back even being co workers in a previous<br>job once before our company now before i<br>would even feel like im intruding in<br>their friendship when close friend would<br>ask me to go with them both to buy<br>office supplies or run errands for the<br>company during weekends again im a<br>homebody and going out sometimes would<br>do my mental health good the dynamic is<br>okay at first i just noticed that it<br>seems like a close friend gets treated<br>badly by human resource representative<br>me minding my own business kept that<br>observation to myself at the end of the<br>day i have no say in their friendship if<br>time yung theyre probably tighter than<br>me and my close friend ve been friends<br>for longer but that doesnt really mean<br>anything to me months into my employment<br>in the company i also found one of my<br>close friends lets name her b needing<br>work and im the type to help out<br>whenever i can so i put in a good work<br>and thankfully i take note around this<br>time we are still okay and my exbest<br>friend is super solid shes years older<br>than me so i respect her the way i would<br>my elders close friend even encouraged<br>me to put in the good word because she<br>says she trusts me with whoever i vouch<br>for especially since will be working<br>under her in case and did get hired she<br>would work under close friend and id be<br>drowning in work from my department<br>while also training while i offload some<br>of my responsibilities to her at the<br>request of the company to make me focus<br>on other things around this time also i<br>found myself having to hold back on<br>company gatherings with weekly dinners<br>because we are every wednesday because<br>my dad got diagnosed with cancer and my<br>mental health was very bad due to<br>overworking myself one day though the<br>boss which is the cofounder scolded me<br>because something went wrong with<br>handling a client and sadly it was b of<br>course best friend so i tried my best to<br>appease the bosss anger and for no she i<br>made sure close friend knew so she can<br>also help me out as is directly under<br>her  both close friend and i spent a<br>good hours solving the problem and she<br>didnt even reply hours later after the<br>shift so weekend i saw its just<br>subtweeting bad words ~ pertaining to me<br>about work and even saying im using my<br>mental health as an excuse why she was<br>attacking me i dont know i was too busy<br>hours before that cleaning up her mess i<br>told close friend about it and she was<br>just confused as i was where all this<br>hostility was coming from especially<br>when close friend and i have been<br>cleaning up after friend ever since she<br>got into the company the kicker here is<br>that  has always confided to me about<br>having post partum the reason why i<br>wanted her to get into ours company so<br>bad because the pay was significantly<br>higher than her old company plus this<br>would greatly help her pay off her bills<br>i rarely indulge her when she confides<br>in me about her marital trouble because<br>im honestly not a good fit to give her<br>advice on that i just make sure to let<br>her know that people are not her enemy<br>her partner is not her enemy and she<br>should give them the chance its sad<br>because she never gave me the chance and<br>immediately assumed i was mad at her for<br>having to pick up after friend at work<br>when really i was just working on<br>autopilot with all the heavy baggage i<br>was already carrying on my own besides<br>post partum is a lot i could go longer<br>not letting her know about my dads<br>diagnosis or my own head going to shit<br>but turns out friend b and human<br>resource representative has already been<br>harboring ill will towards me a few more<br>months after that incident friend has<br>been making it harder for me to do my<br>work so one day i snapped everything got<br>to me and this got the attention of our<br>management and our us team im not one to<br>complain but ive had enough we got a<br>mediation meeting happen  friend in<br>front of me accusing me of making her<br>feel like she was indebted to me when<br>all the time she was in the company ive<br>been focusing on my work and helping<br>clean up whatever work she messed up<br>just so our cofounder wouldnt get mad at<br>her even further during that mediation<br>though it was clear that human resource<br>representative was very biased towards<br>friend b in the process and management<br>even found more instances where human<br>resource representative was breaking<br>company protoc this lead to her and<br>friend being put under and me let off<br>with a warning for acting unbecoming of<br>myself at work after that i simply gray<br>rocked them both i simply cut off my<br>friendship with a year friendship down<br>the drain we were so close that i even<br>let her stay for weeks in my apartment<br>when she and her family would fight so<br>close that i missed a day of work<br>because i ran around town buying them<br>groceries and medicine when i found out<br>their house got cordoned after she got<br>covid during the pandemic i couldnt<br>handle the disrespect the worst thing<br>about this all is the human resource<br>representative is still angry with me<br>why we dont know i feel she gets angrier<br>when i gray rock her when i stay out of<br>her way do whatever she says be the<br>bigger person and just not give in to<br>her taunts shes come to a point that<br>even when  was already let go of the<br>company she would stoop so low as to<br>rally all the new hires against me<br>before even getting to know me she is<br>also very petty i got hospitalized for a<br>week in november for dengue and lets be<br>honest my mental health probably made it<br>even worse i barely get hospitalized our<br>management was so worried and tasked her<br>to send fruits my way but when she found<br>out that close friend has been dropping<br>by to see me after work no one came even<br>apple juice now to the pip part aware<br>that the management is treating me like<br>that just this december i was made to<br>work from home indefinitely to somehow<br>protect me from the hostility of the<br>situation work no longer felt safe for<br>me and im sure my performance decreased<br>with the treatment ive been getting at<br>work only the us team really treated me<br>as human as well as close friend  the<br>higher ups think its because human<br>resource rep is jealous of my friendship<br>with close friend but i dont get that im<br>not the one who forces close friend to<br>hang out with me she just wants to and i<br>dont refuse if it means i get to go out<br>of the house we even invited her out to<br>join us before until she stopped coming<br>on her own accord i just feel like its<br>very unfair im under  for basically<br>being bullied at work i never confront<br>them because theyre all older than me by<br>significant years naman ng  whats more<br>unfair i have many more opportunities in<br>the company and human resource<br>representative is just paying off debt<br>she owes to the company before resigning<br>i have so much to lose while she doesnt<br>thats all hahahah do not know

because im not willing to<br>sacrifice my abilities to sustain my<br>family to speak my mind i know that its<br>a fine line but for the time being im<br>not willing to cross it but i feel like<br>a lot of people here can resonate with<br>this especially those in the level of<br>management or those who own small<br>businesses in order to make ends meet<br>this is going to be a rant and im not<br>pouting or asking for pity so if you<br>think thats what im doing just erase<br>that notion from your mind if you even<br>take the time to read this a lot of<br>people ask me why i dont go out why i<br>dont go to bars why dont go to house<br>parties why at the very most i make<br>shortterm social appearances at<br>gatherings and why for the most part<br>that i spend my free time in my home<br>doing whatever the hell it is that i do<br>so first off lets address the whole<br>concept of whatever it is that i do the<br>first and most obvious thing is that i<br>take take care of my house to the best<br>of my abilities i keep things clean i<br>make sure the dishes are clean i make<br>sure the floors are clean and make sure<br>the bathroom is clean and i make sure<br>that my house is somewhat presentable<br>especially because i have a kiddo and a<br>kiddo should never ever have to live in<br>a dump i also have my own passions and<br>my own pleasures and my own enjoyments<br>if you know me you know that i love<br>playing guitar and if youre a guitar<br>player you know that not only am i a<br>guitar player but im also a tone chaser<br>its one of my passions ive been after my<br>tone ever since i discovered that you<br>can make a guitar sound good without<br>diming the treblebassgain and killing<br>the mids i also like to eat good food<br>and considering that my present<br>circumstance puts me in a situation<br>where half the time im by myself and the<br>other half the time i have my kiddo i go<br>way out of my way to make sure that i<br>can craft delicious meals not only for<br>myself but also for me and my daughter<br>on top of that i have a yard to maintain<br>i know that some of my friends here take<br>different stances when it comes to yard<br>mainte  and i respect all of those<br>opinions im not when it comes to my yard<br>i dont want to have the best yard in<br>town i just want to make sure that my<br>yard looks somewhat presentable yet also<br>is inviting to the natural aspects that<br>yards attract pollinating insects<br>adorable fuzzy critters all that shit i<br>try to make my yard look clean but i<br>dont go to the extreme of making it look<br>manicured to the point of winning some<br>sort of stupid lawn award im also a<br>human i require a minimal amount of<br>sleep during every solar cycle to make<br>sure

aspect<br>of a business i manage the entire<br>fucking aspect the fi cial aspect the<br>customer service aspect the human<br>resources aspect inventory productivity<br>everything i literally manage every<br>single aspect of keeping the body shop<br>that i am an integral part of running<br>paperwork making sure that people are<br>getting a fair wage making sure that the<br>customers are getting way more than they<br>pay for making sure that my vendors are<br>able to supply the commodities necessary<br>to make sure that daytoday operations<br>can run smoothly without having<br>unrealistic expectations of them making<br>sure that calls get answered and<br>voicemails get returned at the end of<br>the day times out of im fucking tired<br>not just physically not just mentally<br>not just emotionally its the unholy<br>trifecta and whats fucked up is that<br>theres not days in the week but rather<br>seven work = hours a week commune =<br>hours a week getting ready = hours a<br>week thats hours a week minimum to make<br>sure that i can make a fair and honest<br>living in order to support my daughter<br>pay my bills and fi cially cover my<br>obligations im not bitching about money<br>this isnt about money this is about time<br>of my time alive is dedicated to my<br>career im not bitching about that what i<br>am bitching about is people expecting me<br>to be able to perform at peak<br>performance when it comes to social<br>functions outside of work is a lot<br>closer to than and you better believe<br>that when it comes to being a parent and<br>being a responsible employeeemployer i<br>give both of those tasks my all i know<br>this was longwinded but it serves a<br>purpose if the people that you know seem<br>like theyre burnt out or not up to the<br>task of socializing at the same pace<br>that you are dont give them grief for it<br>we all recharge in different ways we all<br>should be able to set aside some time<br>for ourselves along with time for the<br>people that we give a fuck about and<br>sometimes its hard to find that balance<br>were all obligated to work for an income<br>in order to sustain the lives that we<br>live and that will never change in the<br>foreseeable future but you know what can<br>change this fucked up notion that people<br>have unlimited amounts of energy on<br>reserve because we dont we get older we<br>get tired we get exhausted and thats not<br>just a physical thing its also a mental<br>thing its also an emotional thing i dont<br>give a fuck if you cut me in general<br>some slack but as a whole cut people<br>some slack sometimes we just got to do<br>the whole fucking bedrotting routine<br>sometimes we just need to sit in the<br>living room with our cats and watch tv<br>sometimes we need to sit

present<br>circumstance puts me in a situation<br>where half the time im by myself and the<br>other half the time i have my kiddo i go<br>way out of my way to make sure that i<br>can craft delicious meals not only for<br>myself but also for me and my daughter<br>on top of that i have a yard to maintain<br>i know that some of my friends here take<br>different stances when it comes to yard<br>mainte  and i respect all of those<br>opinions im not when it comes to my yard<br>i dont want to have the best yard in<br>town i just want to make sure that my<br>yard looks somewhat

way more than they<br>pay for making sure that my vendors are<br>able to supply the commodities necessary<br>to make sure that daytoday operations<br>can run smoothly without having<br>unrealistic

but<br>companies here managed by older filipino<br>managers majority of the time does not<br>impose trainings and they expect you to<br>perform just as good as the other<br>employees who had been working there for<br>years just a short story for further<br>context had my first job complete  and<br>my manager expected me to perform well i<br>didnt even though i have good<br>credentials after graduating college cum<br>praise it would not be enough to<br>surmount that huge knowledge gap from<br>the company but he kept bringing my<br>credentials up to me whenever he thinks<br>i am underperforming it would have been<br>great if there was a manual or<br>guidelines explaining how and why these<br>processes are done or why are they there<br>in the first place it would have been<br>much easier than asking someone else for<br>help i found out later in my experience<br>that companies must have these manuals<br>guidelines and other things explaining<br>their processes so that when no<br>personcoworker is capable of assisting<br>you you can manage it by yourself been<br>with the company for six months and made<br>major achievements for the company such<br>as reduction of reject and wasted<br>materials up to consistently during my<br>probationary period and improve output<br>to oee to not excellent numbers really<br>but good enough the impact is felt<br>throughout the company but the manager<br>takes all the credit yet he considers me<br>underperforming because he sees that<br>that was his achievement not mine he<br>never gave me the raises nor promotion<br>that was necessary he just basked in the<br>limelight all the while squeezing me<br>every bit of output from me quit<br>resigned and the company fell down a<br>very deep hole as it turned out<br>allocations of budget had already been<br>set in stone since the owner is seeing<br>that we are capable of maintaining those<br>numbers during my time however after my<br>resignation those numbers can no longer<br>be met and thus making the company lose<br>more money than it ever should since<br>they moved on to take projects they can<br>not meet and constantly being penalized<br>for not achieving the required numbers<br>managers ego is very big he does not<br>want the owner to know that what kept<br>him above the water is because of his<br>good employees all those experienced and<br>good employees resigned and he was left<br>with new employees never invested on<br>them nor gave them proper care he just<br>squeezed numbers from them numbers could<br>have been met if the manager is not too<br>repulsive and he actually invested in<br>his key employees nah bro he invested<br>only on his solutions that does not work<br>mind you these project charters he had<br>been providing has no data nor basis for<br>it he just believes it works well it<br>doesnt sucks for him my third job same<br>thing and the fourth one is a different<br>story my fourth job is a very big<br>company everything there is free<br>including dorm rent and food exceptions<br>only to hygienic products the company as<br>a whole is great however the department<br>i was in is not news of high attrition<br>rate and abuse not being addressed is<br>extremely prevalent in that department<br>human resource is not doing anything to<br>resolve that issue in that department<br>since procurement manager and human<br>resource manager are helping each other<br>out there had been very talented and<br>experienced employees that had been with<br>the department and all of them wasted by<br>this manager i am not as skilled as<br>anyone who left the company before me<br>however i have very specific skills that<br>keeps me at an advantage to them thats<br>why they kept me in that company problem<br>is i am new to that department and dont<br>know all the processes involved much<br>more the idiosyncrasies of the workplace<br>no training done nor skim through of the<br>processes no manuals nor guidelines and<br>certainly no assistance from tenured<br>employees employees there are also toxic<br>had to do it on my own luckily i program<br>stuff so workload that shoul d take a<br>tenured employee to do for hours only<br>takes me minutes but problem is even<br>though i can finish workload fast there<br>are things i cant do other departments<br>really like me since i was the only one<br>who took the position who can manage the<br>workload i can do it since i have made<br>work automatic but the manager i dont<br>know what his problem is always scolds<br>me problems which are very vague i ask<br>him to clarify what is actually the<br>problem he gave reasons that does not<br>make sense from wrong formats which does<br>not really matter since the files i used<br>are only for tracking things and<br>automating stuff they never are<br>submitted he just sees what i do<br>whenever he goes to my spot and not<br>following the chronological order of<br>doing stuff that chronological order<br>does not really matter as well well<br>customers call you at different times of<br>the day owner sees the improvement in<br>only two months from our department<br>specifically from the task that i had<br>been working on and added me to the<br>group in which the owner is also present<br>managers attitude and aggression towards<br>me heightened even further and drove me<br>to resignation funnily enough he keeps<br>adding me to groupchats so that the<br>owner sees that i am still in the<br>company currently in a new company with<br>training problem is the president who is<br>japanese caught wind of the culture of<br>his company since they do not implement<br>trainings this pissed off the president<br>and mandated clearly that rules set on<br>the manuals must be followed however the<br>culture of the company remained<br>coworkers kept telling me nasty stuff<br>like i was so blessed jokingly back then<br>they endured things without trainings<br>nor assistance boastfully even to go as<br>far as say that they are better than me<br>if they had trainings heres what i<br>observed assistance from coworkers are<br>great in fact better than reading a book<br>or manual in my experience there are<br>very few sometimes they are not from my<br>department who assists me however<br>manuals and guidelines are better in a<br>few aspect since they do not get busy<br>nor toxic sometimes you meet the person<br>whom you need assistance from a specific<br>task but would rather not divulge info<br>because they do not like you or their<br>ego is being stepped on next filipino<br>managers majority not all does not<br>really know how to do their jobs well<br>but this is more prevalent with older<br>managers than younger ones if there are<br>older managers who can do this well i<br>have never met one i have only met<br>younger managers who really do their<br>jobs well the purpose of the post is to<br>inform some and also to discuss what<br>best practices are possible to improve<br>employee performance especially new<br>hires and this is also a rant currently<br>i am working with no standards nor<br>formats so i usually report with my own<br>format scolded a few times because they<br>do not like how it looked or formatted<br>asked them how to improve they only gave<br>vague answers like this is too big this<br>is too small etc there should be numbers<br>not descriptions like how big how small<br>etc next communication this is the first<br>time i have been in a company where<br>influx of information is not well<br>circulated monitorings of data which you<br>need are not saved in a single drive<br>where accessible nor being divulged not<br>because there is a policy about<br>divulging info but because some people<br>just dont want to divulge it to you i<br>really dont knowwhat their gimmick is<br>since i asked why they are not giving it<br>easily i got a reply that you should<br>take the data from the production itself<br>it is not in my job description to<br>monitor your shit that your job<br>monitoring of that data also takes days<br>not just in a single day although there<br>are trackers to keep things documented<br>that is the only time the policy of<br>divulging info is disallowed since it is<br>not my job to communicate to that<br>department about the monitorings they<br>literally tell me that there are only<br>specific named personnel to which they<br>can share those info any story you can<br>share as well regarding this and how you<br>addressed them",

lot of clients theyre too<br>many i lost count out of employees<br>decided to leave because they dump a<br>shit ton of workload on us without<br>giving us a chance to negotiate we need<br>to keep our partners happy managers<br>would file insane incident reports on us<br>for not complying to the deadline<br>employees had pips at one point because<br>of it a lot of ics work beyond working<br>hours without pay am pm schedule because<br>according to our contract overtime pay<br>is invalid in a work from home set up so<br>during covid no one had any overtime<br>pays there was no consideration even<br>when some of my colleagues timed out at<br>am which was seen by all employees a<br>manager was shocked that his overworked<br>ic was denied regularization because<br>apparently this executive director bitch<br>decided to weigh in evals from other<br>managers without informing him we are<br>not paid properly even though we were<br>promoted we had one colleague who was<br>promoted from junior to senior ic with<br>only an appraisal of k in our quarterly<br>evals we have this team engagement shit<br>criterion that bears a significant<br>amount of weight this is based on our<br>engagement during fun meetings where we<br>only play jackbox despite our workload<br>they will give us low scores here we are<br>not favorites no consideration to their<br>employees especially if they are trying<br>to reach a deadline we had this<br>colleague who was sick and had to take a<br>weeklong leave when he came back almost<br>filed an incident report for loss of<br>profit because they had to find a<br>freelance resource to do his work oa and<br>feeling teenage she would yell in public<br>fake laugh and make up stories to try to<br>make us laugh hes just silly hes cute<br>when hes like that they have an<br>offensive sense of humor at times theyre<br>very fond of body shaming we had another<br>colleague who caught covid and<br>eventually recovered without any fi cial<br>support from the company when he came<br>back human resource announced that sss i<br>forgot the gov agency can cover expenses<br>for covid recovery this colleague asked<br>human resource and the chief executive<br>officer in front of all of us if hes<br>qualified to get one even though he has<br>already recovered to which they answered<br>no and fucking laughed at his face<br>saying you are poor  would backstab a<br>former employee who worked poorly during<br>his time in the company and would<br>constantly make him the butt of the joke<br>of every single thing that she thinks<br>was funny imagine being a fucking joke<br>to a whole company its a lot but thats<br>just the tip of the iceberg no one came<br>forward to department of labor and<br>employment despite a lot of us talking<br>about it we feared that if we do so itll<br>lessen the chance of finding a new job<br>heck a lot of us badly needed work that<br>time so fast forward they recruited a<br>lot of people to fill in the vacancies<br>most of them are fresh graduates or just<br>got out of their first job theyve also<br>fully rtod and theyve been posting<br>stories on their company ig account<br>whenever they have a fun thing going on<br>ok so new directive for the companys<br>social media is to show how happy they<br>are as a family to spite those who left<br>a lot of former employees including me<br>are still mutuals with that account<br>thats why she thought of doing it for<br>gods sake i dont care how they are doing<br>right now in terms of fun but i<br>unfollowed them because i keep seeing<br>the face i just wanna throw up keeps on<br>making fun of some former employees like<br>what she did to the formerformer one if<br>she really thinks shes so fucking funny<br>i may not be one of them but i feel so<br>bad for them though to be fair current<br>employees do not like her at all they<br>feel the same way we did when we were<br>still employed there kagasap im also a<br>chika theyre currently making plans and<br>finding a new job before they could<br>submit their resignation this ad agencys<br>never gonna be better if they keep being<br>like that im not sure if other companies<br>behave the same way but if you want to<br>gain loyalty and productivity from your<br>employees please see your employees as<br>humans thats all we ask for tldr is<br>trying to make us former employees<br>regret leaving the company by posting<br>stories on their company  of how happy<br>they are as a family truth is the<br>company is disgusting as fuck in terms<br>of employee

           "refusal to accept additional work ive<br>been searching the web for any<br>information regarding my current<br>predicament recently my department was<br>forced to have a reorganization due to<br>the resignation of one of our members so<br>basically one position was dissolved<br>because they transferred the one<br>assigned to that dissolved position to<br>another role however the duties and<br>responsibilities are not dissolved based<br>on a close door discussion within some<br>of our heads it was decided to give<br>those to me without even discussing it<br>with my immediate superior to know<br>whether i can accommodate the additional<br>tasks they just informed my immediate<br>superior as an for your information<br>basis without discussing the reason why<br>they chose me to shoulder this<br>additional burden they set a meeting to<br>discuss this change at this point im<br>still clueless to the decision of adding<br>some tasks to me talked to me one on one<br>prior to the cascade of reorganization<br>to inform me about this change of scope<br>to my work my position was that i cannot<br>take additional workload and why did<br>they think that i can handle additional<br>workload when in fact neither me nor my<br>immediate superior was consulted about<br>it the only reason they gave was the<br>other person that they considered was<br>already full what happened that day was<br>the heads had a premeeting prior the<br>discussion with us my immediate superior<br>raised my concern in that premeeting so<br>what transpired was they parked the<br>discussion of my added roles for another<br>day they asked to prepare a tms to check<br>whether i can accommodate the additional<br>tasks my concern is that despite my tms<br>showing that i cannot accommodate<br>additional tasks knowing our senior head<br>they can position it that they have the<br>full right to change my work load and<br>not cooperating would merit willful<br>insubordination we will be having a<br>discussion tomorrow and will i have<br>strong legal support if i refuse to<br>accept the additional tasks to add there<br>are other personnel that they choose but<br>it seemed that they are insistent into<br>me taking the additional roles as they<br>dont asked other members to do tms after<br>they made aware of my stand that i<br>cannot accommodate additional task<br>hoping someone can help me will highly<br>appreciate if you can aldo help in<br>providing specific legal provisions and<br>actual case study as i was not able to<br>find any similar case nor legal<br>provision on the basis of refusal to<br>take additional responsibility update<br>just to update everyone who read my<br>complaint i already found another job<br>with higher position and compensation so<br>its like blessing in disguise since i<br>was forced to seek a job outside my<br>current one and that made it even better<br>as for the events related to my post<br>what i found out was that thats why the<br>approach of our new head internally<br>promoted because he felt that i was<br>underloaded his reasoning why he wanted<br>me to overload when they asked me to<br>cover for someone i managed to do cover<br>that person so for him i have a lot of<br>idle time to be able to do that he said<br>i dont or the section he handles is too<br>sensitive to be fair my immediate<br>superior and one of the lt defended me<br>outright that his conclusions are not<br>true they also give me feedback on what<br>happens in their lt meetings so i am<br>aware of what is being discussed about<br>me to clarify the issues issues i was<br>able to cover because i was working at<br>home and i was still working to cover<br>whatever i didnt do because there was an<br>urgent need to do like cover other<br>employees and besides this is work<br>related why is he not questioning other<br>employees who are able to attend coffee<br>and gossip sessions bday bash nonwork<br>related extra curricular activities<br>issue the problem is that i am not<br>reporting to him so all my activities<br>are reported to my immediate superior<br>later i found out that during editing of<br>the monthly reports  when my boss used<br>to be my update since he was a detailed<br>update that top management doesnt need<br>much since they only present company<br>metrics and their group monthly meeting<br>was stopped in which he was normally<br>discussed lastly for the past yrs he<br>didnt raise anything anymore issue about<br>my output so why now had he raised this<br>earlier we could have made an alignment<br>of expectations so they formalized the<br>additional role no adjustment in<br>compensation but through the help of my<br>immediate superior we managed to<br>convince the top management to spread<br>out the responsibilities to different<br>people but at this point im just buying<br>my time to secure another job by the way<br>my immediate superior knows my plans to<br>resign since its the values ​​that the<br>next department head is my concern that<br>i dont want to be in constant battle<br>with the department head just because he<br>is my prejudice against me recently<br>since his plan to overload me the first<br>time didnt succeed he devised a new<br>scheme to overload me again which failed<br>again its just a rumor another suspicion<br>between us both his issues are because<br>my salary is higher than his colleagues<br>who have the same position as me i am an<br>external hire because i found out that<br>all external hires somehow or another<br>have issues or are pressured to take<br>more responsibilities not even<br>explicitly discussing with them if what<br>did he expect like the former because<br>our salary is high he needs to see us<br>working hard at work is there a lesson<br>that i should learn im not sure but here<br>are the things i realized by making good<br>connections i managed to land a better<br>job faster through the help of my former<br>superior not expecting that in less than<br>a month i will immediately find someone<br>to move to know your worth if the<br>management cant see that look somewhere<br>that will see your worth we dont deserve<br>to be in a constant battle within our<br>own department its stressful thats the<br>interaction with outside the department<br>so dont add it if you dont want to<br>change work know how to kiss a$s because<br>im not chummy with our new manager i<br>suddenly got heated",

working there for<br>years just a short story for further<br>context had my first job complete  and<br>my manager expected me to perform well i<br>didnt even though i have good<br>credentials after graduating college cum<br>praise it would not be enough to<br>surmount that huge knowledge gap from<br>the company but he kept bringing my<br>credentials up to me whenever he thinks<br>i am underperforming it would have been<br>great if there was a manual or<br>guidelines explaining how and why these<br>processes are done or why are they there<br>in the first place it would have been<br>much easier than asking someone else for<br>help i found out later in my experience<br>that companies must have these manuals<br>guidelines and other things explaining<br>their processes so that when no<br>personcoworker is capable of assisting<br>you you can manage it by yourself been<br>with the company for six months and made<br>major achievements for the company such<br>as reduction of reject and wasted<br>materials up to consistently during my<br>probationary period and improve output<br>to oee to not excellent numbers really<br>but good enough the impact is felt<br>throughout the company but the manager<br>takes all the credit yet he considers me<br>underperforming because he sees that<br>that was his achievement not mine he<br>never gave me the raises nor promotion<br>that was necessary he just basked in the<br>limelight all the while squeezing me<br>every bit of output from me quit<br>resigned and the company fell down a<br>very deep hole as it turned out<br>allocations of budget had already been<br>set in stone since the owner is seeing<br>that we are capable of maintaining those<br>numbers during my time however after my<br>resignation those numbers can no longer<br>be met and thus making the company lose<br>more money than it ever should since<br>they moved on to take projects they can<br>not meet and constantly being penalized<br>for not achieving the required numbers<br>managers ego is very big he does not<br>want the owner to know that what kept<br>him above the water is because of his<br>good employees all those experienced and<br>good employees resigned and he was left<br>with new employees never invested on<br>them nor gave them proper care he just<br>squeezed numbers from them numbers could<br>have been met if the

providing has no data nor basis for<br>it he just believes it works well it<br>doesnt sucks for him my third job same<br>thing and the fourth one is a different<br>story my fourth job is a very big<br>company everything there is free<br>including dorm rent and food exceptions<br>only to hygienic products the company as<br>a whole is great however the department<br>i was in is not news of high attrition<br>rate and abuse not being addressed is<br>extremely prevalent in that department<br>human resource is not doing anything to<br>resolve that issue in that department<br>since procurement manager and human<br>resource manager are helping each other<br>out there had been very talented and<br>experienced employees that had been with<br>the department and all of them wasted by<br>this manager i am not as skilled as<br>anyone who left the company before me<br>however i have very specific skills that<br>keeps me at an advantage to them thats<br>why they kept me in that company problem<br>is i am new to that department and dont<br>know all the processes involved much<br>more the idiosyncrasies of the workplace<br>no training done nor skim through of the<br>processes no manuals nor guidelines and<br>certainly no assistance from tenured<br>employees employees there are also toxic<br>had to do it on my own luckily i program<br>stuff so workload that shoul d take a<br>tenured employee to do for hours only<br>takes me minutes but problem is even<br>though i can finish workload fast there<br>are things i cant do other departments<br>really like me since i was the only one<br>who took the position who can manage the<br>workload i can do it since i have made<br>work automatic but the manager i dont<br>know what his problem is always scolds<br>me problems which are very vague i ask<br>him to clarify what is actually the<br>problem he gave reasons that does not<br>make sense from wrong formats which does<br>not really matter since the files i used<br>are only for tracking things and<br>automating stuff they never are<br>submitted he just sees what i do<br>whenever he goes to my spot and not<br>following the chronological order of<br>doing stuff that chronological order<br>does not really matter as well well<br>customers call you at different times of<br>the day owner sees the improvement in<br>only two months from our department<br>specifically from the task that i had<br>been working on and added me to the<br>group in which the owner is also present<br>managers attitude and aggression towards<br>me heightened even further and drove me<br>to resignation funnily enough he keeps<br>adding me to groupchats so that the<br>owner sees that i am still in the<br>company currently in a new company with<br>training problem is the president who is<br>japanese caught wind of the culture of<br>his company since they do not implement<br>trainings this pissed off the president<br>and mandated clearly that rules set on<br>the manuals must be followed however the<br>culture of the company remained<br>coworkers kept telling me nasty stuff<br>like i was so blessed jokingly back then<br>they endured things without trainings<br>nor assistance boastfully even to go as<br>far as say that they are better than me<br>if they had trainings heres what i<br>observed assistance from coworkers are<br>great in fact better than reading a book<br>or manual in my experience there are<br>very few sometimes they are not from my<br>department who assists me however<br>manuals and guidelines are better in a<br>few aspect since they do not get busy<br>nor toxic sometimes you meet the person<br>whom you need assistance from a specific<br>task but would rather not divulge info<br>because they do not like you or their<br>ego is being stepped on next filipino<br>managers majority not all does not<br>really know how to do their jobs well<br>but this is more prevalent with older<br>managers than younger ones if there are<br>older managers who can do this well i<br>have never met one i have only met<br>younger managers who really do their<br>jobs well the purpose of the post is to<br>inform some and also to discuss what<br>best practices are possible to improve<br>employee performance especially new<br>hires and this is also a rant currently<br>i am working with no standards nor<br>formats so i usually report with my own<br>format scolded a few times because they<br>do not like how it looked or formatted<br>asked them how to improve they only gave<br>vague answers like this is too big this<br>is too

partners happy managers<br>would file insane incident reports on us<br>for not complying to the deadline<br>employees had pips at one point because<br>of it a lot of ics work beyond working<br>hours without pay am pm schedule because<br>according to our contract overtime pay<br>is invalid in a work from home set up so<br>during covid no one had any overtime<br>pays there was no consideration even<br>when some of my colleagues timed out at<br>am which was seen by all employees a<br>manager was shocked that his overworked<br>ic was denied regularization because<br>apparently this executive director bitch<br>decided to weigh in evals from other<br>managers without informing him we are<br>not paid properly even though we were<br>promoted we had one colleague who was<br>promoted from junior to senior ic with<br>only an appraisal of k in our quarterly<br>evals we have this team engagement shit<br>criterion that bears a significant<br>amount of weight this is based on our<br>engagement during fun meetings where we<br>only play jackbox despite our workload<br>they will give us low scores here we are<br>not favorites no consideration to their<br>employees especially if they are trying<br>to reach a deadline we had this<br>colleague who was sick and had to take a<br>weeklong leave when he came back almost<br>filed an incident report for loss of<br>profit because they had to find a<br>freelance resource to do his work oa and<br>feeling teenage she would yell in public<br>fake laugh and make up stories to try to<br>make us laugh hes just silly hes cute<br>when hes like that they have an<br>offensive sense of humor at times theyre<br>very fond of body shaming we had another<br>colleague who caught covid and<br>eventually recovered without any fi cial<br>support from the company when he came<br>back human resource announced that sss i<br>forgot the gov agency can cover expenses<br>for covid recovery this colleague asked<br>human resource and the chief executive<br>officer in front of all of us if hes<br>qualified to get one even though he has<br>already recovered to which they answered<br>no and fucking laughed at his face<br>saying you are poor  would backstab a<br>former employee who worked poorly during<br>his time in the company and would<br>constantly make him the butt of the joke<br>of every single thing that she thinks<br>was funny imagine being a fucking joke<br>to a whole company its a lot but thats<br>just the tip of the iceberg no one came<br>forward to department of labor and<br>employment despite a lot of us talking<br>about it we feared that if we do so itll<br>lessen the chance of finding a new job<br>heck a lot of us badly needed work that<br>time so fast forward they recruited a<br>lot of people to fill in the vacancies<br>most of them are fresh graduates or just<br>got out of their first job theyve also<br>fully rtod and theyve been posting<br>stories on their company ig account<br>whenever they have a fun thing going on<br>ok so new directive for the companys<br>social media is to show how happy they<br>are as a family to spite those who left<br>a lot of former employees including me<br>are still mutuals with that account<br>thats why she thought of doing it for<br>gods sake i dont care how they are doing<br>right now in terms of fun but i<br>unfollowed them because i keep

theyre currently making plans and<br>finding a new job before they could<br>submit their resignation this ad agencys<br>never gonna be better if they keep being<br>like that im not sure if other

to<br>the resignation of one of our members so<br>basically one position was dissolved<br>because they transferred the one<br>assigned to that dissolved position to<br>another role however the duties and<br>responsibilities are not dissolved based<br>on a close door discussion within some<br>of our heads it was decided to give<br>those to me without even discussing it<br>with my immediate superior to know<br>whether i can accommodate the additional<br>tasks they just informed my immediate<br>superior as an for your information<br>basis without discussing the reason why<br>they chose me to shoulder this<br>additional burden they set a meeting to<br>discuss this change at this point im<br>still clueless to the decision of adding<br>some tasks to me talked to me one on one<br>prior to the cascade of reorganization<br>to inform me about this change of scope<br>to my work my position was that i cannot<br>take additional workload and why did<br>they think that i can handle additional<br>workload when in fact neither me nor my<br>immediate superior was consulted about<br>it the only reason they gave was the<br>other person that they considered was<br>already full what happened that day was<br>the heads had a premeeting prior the<br>discussion with us my immediate superior<br>raised my concern in that premeeting so<br>what transpired was they parked the<br>discussion of my added roles for another<br>day they asked to prepare a tms to check<br>whether i can accommodate the additional<br>tasks my concern is that despite my tms<br>showing that i cannot accommodate<br>additional tasks knowing our senior head<br>they can position it that they have the<br>full right to change my work load and<br>not cooperating would merit willful<br>insubordination we will be having a<br>discussion tomorrow and will i have<br>strong legal support if i refuse to<br>accept the additional tasks to add there<br>are other personnel that they choose but<br>it seemed that they are insistent into<br>me taking the additional roles as they<br>dont asked other members to do tms after<br>they made aware of my stand that i<br>cannot accommodate additional task<br>hoping someone can help me will highly<br>appreciate if you can aldo help in<br>providing specific legal provisions and<br>actual case study as i was not able to<br>find any similar case nor legal<br>provision on the basis of refusal to<br>take additional responsibility update<br>just to update everyone who read my<br>complaint i already found another job<br>with higher position and compensation so<br>its like blessing in disguise since i<br>was forced to seek a job outside my<br>current one and that made it even better<br>as for the events related to my post<br>what i found out was that thats why the<br>approach of our new head internally<br>promoted because he felt that i was<br>underloaded his reasoning why he wanted<br>me to overload when they asked me to<br>cover for someone i managed to do cover<br>that person so for him i have a lot of<br>idle time to be able to do that he said<br>i dont or the section he handles is too<br>sensitive to be fair my immediate<br>superior and one of the lt defended me<br>outright that his conclusions are not<br>true they also give me feedback on what<br>happens in their lt meetings so i am<br>aware of what is being discussed about<br>me to clarify the issues issues i was<br>able to cover because i was working at<br>home and i was still working to cover<br>whatever i didnt do because there was an<br>urgent need to do like cover other<br>employees and besides this is work<br>related why is he not questioning other<br>employees who are able to attend coffee<br>and gossip sessions bday bash nonwork<br>related extra curricular activities<br>issue the problem is that i am not<br>reporting to him so all my activities<br>are reported to my immediate superior<br>later i found out that during editing of<br>the monthly reports  when my boss used<br>to be my update since he was a detailed<br>update that top management doesnt need<br>much since they only present company<br>metrics and their group monthly meeting<br>was stopped in which he was normally<br>discussed lastly for the past yrs he<br>didnt raise anything anymore issue about<br>my output so why now had he raised this<br>earlier we could have made an alignment<br>of expectations so they formalized the<br>additional role no adjustment in<br>compensation but through the help of my<br>immediate superior we managed to<br>convince the top management to spread<br>out the responsibilities to different<br>people but at this point im just buying<br>my time to secure another job by the way<br>my immediate superior knows my plans to<br>resign since its the values ​​that the<br>next department head is my concern that<br>i dont want to be in constant battle<br>with the department head just because he<br>is my prejudice against me recently<br>since his plan to overload me the first<br>time didnt succeed he devised a new<br>scheme to overload me again which failed<br>again its just a rumor another suspicion<br>between us both his issues are because<br>my salary is higher than his colleagues<br>who have the same position as me i am an<br>external hire because i found out that<br>all external hires somehow or another<br>have issues or are pressured to take<br>more responsibilities not even<br>explicitly discussing with them if what<br>did he expect like the former because<br>our salary is high he needs to see us<br>working hard at work is there a lesson<br>that i should learn im not sure but here<br>are the things i realized by making good<br>connections i managed to land a better<br>job faster through the help of my former<br>superior not expecting that in less than<br>a month i will immediately find someone<br>to move to know your worth if the<br>management cant see that look somewhere<br>that will
